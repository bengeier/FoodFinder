{"text":"Gonna give it a solid 5 stars. For $8 a really big meal with a quarter chicken, potatos and a salad. I think they could fit proper tables there, but the counter is okay as well if you're only two or three people. Go to Coco Rico instead of the over-priced Schwartz's next door."}
{"text":"Coco Rico hits the spot. Make sure you order everything with spices on top! The chicken is tender and the potatoes are really flavourful. The service could be better, but what do you expect for such a bustling joint?"}
{"text":"Wow! Grandiose! La chair de poule juste en repensant à ces frites poivrées et ce poulet...ah ce poulet... Juteux, goûteux, épicé à souhait... Bref, le prix à ridiculement bas pour la qualité du repas. Je vous le conseille fortement 1-2-3-4 fois"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and no matter how long the line is it always goes quick. Reasonable prices but I wish the place had a few more chairs!"}
{"text":"Was here on Sunday April 20, 2014.  Didn't get a chance to \"check in\" ... now back in TO and not able to do it.     Feel a little bad for this place... situated right beside Schwartz on St-Laurent.    Ordered the chicken sandwich with some potatoes.   Came to $8.50 ... Sandwich was a bit small but chicken was pretty good.   The bread was good as well.   Not sure if business is good or not for them being right beside Schwartz... but there was a ton of chicken,  ribs and lamb cooking.  Place would do much better of not in that area.   Overall... not bad at all."}
{"text":"Tried the quarter chicken (with spicy sauce) with potatoes & macaroni salad, satisfied the craving for some roast chicken, but was expecting a bit more 'oopmh' from the spicy sauce cos it didn't send the 'spicy signals' to my brain until later, like after I'd left the place. Onsite service offers plastic cutlery and styrofoam plates, which was a bit blah. Bring your own handi-wipes if you're gonna get serious with the chicken, otherwise you have to contend with those napkins that just keep on sticking to your fingers."}
{"text":"Do Not Eat Here!!!! $40 in the trash. Dried out inedible chicken breast, you can't call yourself a chicken rotisserie place if you can't cook a good chicken..When I went in with 4 plates of chicken, they wouldn't even change it.. All the lady said was\"in all her time she has never seen chicken breast that wasn't dried out\"  Her solution was to add sauce.  If zero stars where possible, Coco Rico would get it for food and customer service."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, quick service, simple menu.  You can buy your chicken whole, half or quarter, potatoes (roasted underneath the rotisserie chicken!), ribs, and salad options (coleslaw and macaroni). There are also portuguese buns, a sign for corn bread, which was absent, and egg tarts.   The chicken was good, I got it with spices but couldn't really taste the difference, the ribs, also good - the potatoes looked amazing but didn't really taste of much.  Very, very filling, and very reasonably priced.   I'm interested in trying their sister restaurent, which is actually a sit down place rather than a take out shop."}
{"text":"Our first time in Montreal and we tried out this place, it was truly AMAZING! We visited this place during our visit at least 3 times, just for the BBQ RIBS.The funny thing is we are from South Carolina and we KNOW BBQ very well but this place is a total GEM."}
{"text":"Ribs and chicken were both dry.  Possibly because they weren't served very warm.  Potatoes were tasty.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I was in vacation in Montreal, in the plateau area. I passed in front of this restaurant many times, the smell is very good. So I solved to check... I ordered a chicken sandwich, with potatoes and a coleslaw. The sandwich was too dry, even with the sauce. In my opinion, Romados is better..."}
{"text":"The ribs were good, but the chicken didn't have much flavor and was quite dry.  Potatoes were fine.  Very filling & a good value.  The sauce didn't have much flavor (got the mild version.)"}
{"text":"I am glad to say I inadvertently happened upon this gem during an attempt to visit a deli (who shall not be named) that was right next door.  Needless to say I am so glad I didn't go to the deli. The menu here is very simple but simply delicious. The chicken here is so flavorful, and the sauce you can have drizzled over everything is perfect. I had the chicken sandwich on the amazing Portuguese roll. Being from Southeastern Massachusetts and Portuguese myself I am sort of a connoisseur when it comes to Portuguese popsecos.  I also got the potatoes and a queijada de nata(custard cup). The meal was delicious and very reasonably priced.  If I am ever in Montreal again I will make sure I stop by Coco Rico and get me some chicken."}
{"text":"Bon poulet rôti avec sauce piquante, je recommande également les ribs.  C'est très petit comme endroit donc de préférence prenez pour emporter. :)"}
{"text":"Coco Rico is an awesome landmark, because if you've reached here, you're just a couple of blocks away from Romados (corner of de Bullion and Rachel), which is where you should head if you want really delicious Portuguese rotisserie chicken. I live in the neighbourhood, and I've tried both places more than once, and to me it's a no-brainer. This isn't to say that Coco Rico is bad, but its just that Romados sets the bar way higher."}
{"text":"After a great day of galavanting up and down St. Laurent, Coco Rico is a great place to end your day if you are on a fixed food budget. I see students and locals of all ages and ethnicity come here to feast on some good ol' poulet, so I must give this a try.  I ended up sharing a rotisserie chicken with my girlfriend and a side. The chicken skin is thin, crispy and a piece of heaven in every bite. Lets just say someone can get hurt fighting over it. I almost poked my girlfriend for a piece. My mom is going to kill me, she raised her children not to fight over food and I have committed a cardinal sin. SORRY MOM!!!"}
{"text":"A decent place to get rotisserie chicken. A bit dry and lacks some flavour but it's still quite tasty. And it's really cheap to get half a chicken with side of roasted potatoes. Their pasteis de natas are amazing, definitely my favourite thing there"}
{"text":"Is it just me or does the chicken sandwich trio taste better when ordered in the evening compared to the afternoon?  My regular is the chicken sandwich trio consisting of an honest-to-God deliciously greasy chicken sandwich, potatoes, and a choice of salad (I always go with macaroni).  This stuff is the stuff, if ya know what I mean. It's a nice change to have boiled/roasted (not sure which) potatoes instead of fries on the side like the usual. The potatoes are really good so that's a plus. I'm also a fan of the macaroni salad.. If you didn't get that already.   The staff is also super nice so bonus points!"}
{"text":"I had my very first Portuguese chicken sandwich at Coco Rico and really enjoyed it. The chicken was juicy and I had never eaten anything like it before. Although I asked for it spicy, I didn't taste much heat, however, it tasted delicious all the same. I personally like it best of the few I've had in the city.   I came in just before 9pm on a Wednesday night so there was no line. The sandwich itself came to about $6. It might be a little small if you are feeling quite hungry though, so make sure to add the sides for a \"full\" meal!"}
{"text":"I happen to discover this place (thanks to Schwartz). As a tired customer standing in line I decided to risk it! but it turned out to be a rather decent discovery.  Like this place because it's simple and to the point -  Delicious chicken with some wicked hot sauce over it and some boiled and bbqed potates (cooked alongside with the chicken) on the side makes a very filling and delectable meal.  The chicken is really tender and moist and just melts in your mouth.   Doesn't have too much space to sit but honestly I'd keep my focus on the chicken and do with it :p Totally worth it!  Staff are very friendly and warm. Price is cheap (1/2 chicken for 5.99 +Tx is a steal deal)  They do serve bbq'd ribs too but haven't tasted em. May be next time..def!"}
{"text":"Great food and helpful staff. The only problem is that they only accept cash or debit card. It has to be a Canadian debit card (US won't work). There's an ATM in store but it cost $2.99 per transaction."}
{"text":"Très bon poulet avec pommes de terres délicieuses. La sauce piquante est à essayer et les prix sont très abordables. Mais je m'attendais à du poulet portugais plus portugais. J'ai quand même pris un bon repas à bon prix.  À bien y penser, c'est un des très bon poulet que j'ai pu manger et la sauce piquante est un must. C'est une expérience que seulement Montréal peut nous offrir. Bonne bouffe !"}
{"text":"Stable depuis des lustres cette rôtisserie fait de tout,mais la vraie spécialité : sandwich au poulet sauce épicée avec patates personnel aimable.prix doux"}
{"text":"I was jonesing for some rotisserie chicken, and Rotisserie Romados had yet to open up for lunch, so I headed over to Coco Rico instead. The buying process here was quick and easy - a half chicken, potatoes and coleslaw is a perfect serving size for two moderately hungry individuals. I liked the gently-paprika seasoned mini potatoes. The mayo slaw was a little too creamy for my liking; I was hoping it might quench my thirst from the savory and greasy chicken. The skin on the roasted chicken was very delectable. I wouldn't have eaten a lesser roasted chicken skin."}
{"text":"This place is okay , the chicken lacked in flavour but was cooked nicely .  I think the thing that makes me give this a 3 star was the employees . They seemed not to care about the customer . I felt uncomfortable ."}
{"text":"the middle aged woman with round glasses that greeted me was not very personable. she made me feel not valued as a customer, almost as bad as that girl down at atlas pizza. anyway I just wanted a chicken sandwich so once I got it, it was dry and I could barely chew it and it was probably sitting there for hours, no doubt. In attempt to hide the staleness of the entire thing, she doused my sandwich with their canola oil like \"sauce\". to make matters worse, i couldn't have access to napkins and was only given one sheet of cheap quality napkin and when I had to walk over, with oil dripping down my hands, to beg for just one more napkin, I could Feel my soul wanting to exit my body as the same that clearly has happened to this place"}
{"text":"I usually go here after making a stop at Schwartz.  I have eaten the chicken here and it's great but I usually just grab some natas as dessert after going to Schwartz since I'm pretty full.  These are some of the best natas I've had and I recommend coming here just for those."}
{"text":"Good chicken sandwich. A touch dry, but that's also my fault for ordering all white meat. Good spices, and excellent bread. The lady serving me was super helpful and friendly, and the price is right ($5.49 for a chicken or pork sandwich). Also got a couple of natas to go, and they were delicious."}
{"text":"A late review but the experience still saved in my mind. That speaks almost everything.  I don't want to compare Coco Rico with Romados, yet they are very close by geographical distance. However personally, Portuguese Chicken tastes more juicy than Poulet rôti Québecois by average.  I ordered 2 slices of ribs and 1/4 chicken combo, that came with the famous potatoes. Ribs were a surprise coz it beyonded my expect, their homemade sauce was ideal mate for the ribs. Chicken was exactly what I thought, typical Portuguese flavor. Slightly less interesting maybe because I didn't order the hot sauce. Potatoes were lying on oils, not cooked on perfect time, inside was a bit tough but still tasteful, which i could not complaint, have to say. Above the foods, those guys and girls are very friendly and pleasant.  A huge plus was after the horrible experience in Kazu and cold fresh oysters in Maestro SVP, I did need that hot, tasty, juicy chicken and ribs for the damn snowing freezing winter night.  As some other reviews said, I do think that Coco Rico should have reached a higher success if they decide to move to somewhere else in Montreal. Romados and Jano are too strong to set the price range down. And Schwartz's is not a good companion for sure. Coco Rico deserves a better place and a further improvement.  The Goods:The unfamous ribs! The outstanding smell. The above average quality of pre-cooked food. Not good not bad: Selections are limited. Maybe it's the stra of the restaurant but it's more suitable for take out not dine in. Chicken is there, not far but still distance from perfect. The cons: Bar stools are the places only offer if you want to dine in. And half of them suffer the cold wind if someone enters and leaves. You can not even find a place to hang on your winter coat."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick snack with 3 of my friends. We already had dinner plans, but we wanted to try this place. So we ordered the combo #2, which comes with the ribs and the chicken. We also got the macaroni salad and the slaw. All of it came out to be around $20 (which I think is pretty cheap given how much food we got)  I really liked the chicken. It was flavourful and tender. The ribs were also pretty good as well! The only thing we regret was that we couldn't eat too much cuz of our dinner reservation"}
{"text":"this place makes you drool the moment you walk in the door to sum up if you leave this place spending less 10$ then you've only sampled the best let me say it again the best chicken in town ..next to my mommas .."}
{"text":"I refused to eat this for years, but my sister insisted and two summers ago, I tried it. This past weekend I had it again. Mmmmm...it's so dirty. The best of Portuguese roasted chicken (and pork).   It's a divey joint with limited seating which equates to bang for your buck.  A quick (assuming there is no line) delicious feast between shopping. My favourite part is the potatoes - they fill the bottom of their rotisseries with these carby nuggets and let the juice and fat from the meat drip all over them. Oh soooo dirty. I had the pork ribs with a side of macaroni salad and coleslaw. My friend had the chicken.   You can't eat this a lot. But when I do, the added poundage on my butt is nothing compared to a happy tummy.  P.S. I heart their egg tarts."}
{"text":"The place is straight GOOD!  Too many cultures roast chicken for it not to be a good thing!  I had the 1/4 chicken and chicken sandwich and both cole slaws (vinegar or mayo based).  The chicken was really tasty and they roast so many chickens you know they got it to a science!.  I did skip the potatoes but they looked really good.  The bread the chicken sandwich came on was French in every way, crusty outside and airy inside with a distinctively french bread flavor.  They have a bit of seating inside but perfect to get to go and eat it in the park like the previous reviewer stated."}
{"text":"This is a solid bet for Portuguese chicken.  The chicken is similar to Romados, in the sense that it's moist but just a little tasteless as the flavour does not reach the inside of the chicken, but the skin and top layer is awesome.  The star attraction here is the potatoes, melt in your mouth, tender warm and swimming in oil, nothing beats them. Romados offers a ton of fries so it's better value since Coco Rico gives about 8-10 potatoes.I normally buy extra potatoes and ask for spicy as they are worth the extra calories.  The interior is very sparse, there is a counter along the wall and that's it. It's understandable that there are no formal tables as there are lineups most of the time and there's not much room."}
{"text":"We have been going for lunch for many years, their food is fresh, good quality (their chicken is delicious) and we have never been disappointed, consistently good & fresh.  Value for the quality.  Not a fancy place yet excellent food."}
{"text":"Really loved their chicken! Got some take out today and the staff was friendly plus the price was right!  Definitely going back to buy some full chickens for my meal prep."}
{"text":"Parfait pour un take out.  La sauce piquante faite avec la graisse de cuisson est top!"}
{"text":"For under $20 my gf and I got two quarter chickens with potatoes, coleslaw, macaroni salad, pop and a portuguese egg tart. My gf got the mild sauce and I got the spicy sauce, the spicy sauce had a nice kick to it however the chicken did not have much flavour. The chicken was pretty moist and tender but not as good as Romados like others have mentioned. Got only a few potatoes which were soft and hot, once again not that much flavour with those as well. The macaroni/coleslaw salad was decent and my gf said the tart was good but did not taste fresh.  Overall I give this place a 3.5/5, food was just okay and the same goes for the price."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Got a whole chicken to myself, was a pretty satisfying dinner. Eat it fast, the chicken dries out quick. I'll definitely get it with extra spicy sauce next time, they seem to skimp on the sauce."}
{"text":"chickennnnnnnn. I ordered the sandwhich trio and it was delicious. Juicy and flavourful chicken. I was a newbie to this place so I didn't realize you could customize the sandwich, it was still really good! Potatoes were ok and the macaroni salad was great!  I love the way this place smells when you walk through the door. ughguhgu so heavenly.  Get you order to go because you can eat outside when it's pretty and warm."}
{"text":"We showed up tired and hungry. The line moved quickly and they were very forgiving of my franglais. Excellent ribs, we really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"I was passing by trying to go to another restaurant last night when my eye caught these multiple chickens on a rotisserie turning over looking so yummy - the aroma of roasting chicken was also drawing me closer. We went in and read the blackboard menu that sells Roast Portuguese style chicken, ribs, ham & choriço. You can go all out and get a plate of food that comes with roast potatoes, & choice of salad; creamy or vinegar coleslaw, or macaroni. You choose the size of chicken 1/4, 1/2 or whole. I had the 1/2 chicken dinner with hot sauce(not hot at all). I also had a pateis de Nata- good ( a bit too sweet to me) but pastry was great. My son had the 1/4 rib plate( side ribs are used here), decent flavour & texture. If you want a cheaper option they have bifana (pork sandwhich) & chicken on a bun instead.  The place is really set up to be a takeout shop with limited bar stools against the other wall. Casual basic place. Since this was my first Portuguese roast chicken restaurant in Montreal I was pleased. My chicken was a generous portion size and tender. The chicken flavour is kept simple, the skin was crisp, the potatoes were good too. I enjoyed my meal overall."}
{"text":"We ran into this restaurant while exploring a festival on Saint-Laurent. The rotisserie chicken looked so good we decided to walk back to this establishment for dinner. We opted to have the non spicy version of the rotisserie chicken which was still very moist and flavorful. We ordered inside and then brought our food to the outdoor patio to do some people-watching as the festival was still ongoing. Overall a nice choice for an affordable ans tasty meal."}
{"text":"On avait pris ça pour manger un soir où nous étions 7... on recommencera c'est certain ! Le poulet est bon et bien grillé (même si ce n'est pas du poulet fermier), les petites patates cuites dans le gras, un régal et finalement, le jambon braisé, top ! Et en plus de ça, les prix sont très abordables ! Merci mon voisin de bureau pour la bonne adresse ;)"}
{"text":"Simply the best BBQ chicken in town. I don't mind walking there from downtown just because it is so delicious. Takeouts only."}
{"text":"Pretty good place right next to Schwartz's. The food is not very fresh but pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try the famous Portuguese chicken and on this particular night, after a long day at work, I just didn't feel like cooking at all, yet without spending $20 on dinner. I gave Coco Rico a try.   I didn't eat at the restaurant since I live a few blocks from there. However, I noticed that the restaurant is very small and I don't think it is the best place to eat in. Ideally, order as take-out.   I had the chicken thigh and it was great. Nothing I hate more than dry chicken and it was not the case here. It was juicy and yet not fatty. Ask for plenty of napkins because it can get really messy and be careful if you wear nice clothes.   You MUST ask for extra spicy sauce with it. It adds a little something to your meal. The potatoes are really worth trying. The coleslaw was... coleslaw. Better than St-Hubert's for sure.   Price - and that was the biggest surprise: $8 (with taxes) for a chicken thigh, potatoes and salad. I couldn't believe that I had a full meal for under $8; I don't think I have seen this very often in Montreal. Maravilhoso!  Conclusion: Will definitely go back, probably once a week.   P.-S. If you standing in line to get in a certain deli restaurant and you get right next to Coco Rico, just go in. It is worth it."}
{"text":"the chicken leg i had was really soft and tasty but the sauce, what i asked for a spicy, is disappointing. the sauce is only oily without any flavour. let's say, go to Romados"}
{"text":"Situé à coté du légendaire Schwartz's, Coco Rico est en quelque sorte dans l'ombre d'un restaurant qui n'a rien d'un rival, puisqu'on ne sert même pas de poulet à côté. Si les sandwichs à la viande fumée font la réputation de Schwartz's, ce sont les sandwichs au poulet qui font celle de Coco Rico. Le poulet y est juteux, et les pains, faits maison, sont frais et croustillants. La sauce piquante mises dans les sandwich fait du tout un vrai régal, qui ne coûte que quelques dollars. Aussi, on y vend les petits pains utilisés pour confectionner les sandwichs pour quelques sous. Lorsque je passe devant Coco Rico, j'en achète systématiquement un, pour le manger en marchant ou lors du prochain repas."}
{"text":"I love their chicken, they always have their chicken crunchy which is what I like. I also order their hickey wings if they are available because they run out of it quickly.   We always get a full chicken with coleslaw and round potatoes. It is a full meal and fast to grab especially when in rush to go to work. Best Portuguese chicken in town."}
{"text":"I am somewhat less impressed with this place than I used to be, now that I've shopped around for Portuguese BBQ (the king is Romados on Bullion/Rachel, but Cabane across the street and even Rocky's on St-Laurent a few doors south of Rachel also both make a better sandwich--and I had the friendliest experience out of any of these places at the latter), but I'm still a repeat customer and plan to make an occasional showing whenever I'm in the area. It's definitely the most convenient alternative when the Schwartz' lineup is around the block. The fried potatoes are those really super hearty little ones that blow anything I've had outside of QC out of the water. I'm unsure how I feel about the spice blend they shake on when you ask for it hot; it's certainly spicy, but it's so salty that it reminds me suspiciously of Dorito seasoning. Make sure you get a lot of whatever fatty deliciousness they apply to your food with that oil-soaked paintbrush, though, and get a few natas for dessert. Also, you are strongly encouraged to eat in, especially in the cold; their food gets to you at just about the minimum acceptable temperature, and the flavour really doesn't hold up when it gets any cooler."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick lunch or dinner its a good place to go, There is a long counter and a few stools if you want to eat there,  but most people do take out. The specialty here is chicken,  they also serve pork roast and bbque ribs. You can have  a whole chicken or a portion. I tried the combo sandwhich meal, served with roasted potatoes and a mini salad (creamy slaw,  regular slaw or macaroni) . I enjoyed the sandwich but will definitely ask for extra sauce next time. I also tried the pork roast and not really impressed. Good place to try but stick with the chicken."}
{"text":"If you are looking for quality authentic fast food this is as good as it gets. The flavours and textures of the meats are exceptionally good. I have had my share of chicken and ribs and this is very good. I make my own version of great ribs that I have to say rank about 8th best I've ever had. These are a close first. I'd say tied for first best I've ever had. I actually sat there and took a bite and looked back at the servers and looked around the place wondering how can they be so good out of a simple place. The chicken is equally done to perfection. Forget about swish chalet of others of that kind this is crispy skin tender meat full of savoury goodness. There is a famous smoked meat place near by that had a line up outside. I can't understand why you would wait in line when this spectacular food is just steps away. The staff is friendly in English and French. The prices are very fair. If I ran the place I'd try to get better seating. They could do a full service and I would go as often as I could.  If you crave amazing flavour chicken and ribs you need to stop by and have a bite."}
{"text":"My husband and I rented an apartment not far from this place a couple of summers ago and it's now become a required stop every time we visit Montreal (along with stocking up on Fairmount Bagels). The crispy chicken with the spicy sauce in the middle of that soft roll are just heavenly. We don't always get the side potatoes, but they are delicious as well. I'm a fan of the creamy cole slaw; my husband likes the macaroni salad. I got one of their natas (the custard cakes) this last visit, too, and they are just as good as the originals I had in Portugal. On top of the good food, the service is fast and friendly. It's a teeny bit pricey for what it is, but still very reasonable. Skip Schwartz (over hyped!) and come here instead. I really wish they'd open one in NYC!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a friend! We decided to get half a chicken with salad and potatoes. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the spicy sauce they add gives it a nice kick. The coleslaw was average and the potatoes were flavorful but did get a few that were not cooked all the way through. Was a bit perplexed when the woman behind the counter charged me 50 cents for an extra paper plate? Overall not a bad lunch if you are craving Portuguese chicken but i would still choose ramados given the choice."}
{"text":"I am a Coco Rico lover, and not just because I have been romanced by a tall man with the spicy chicken sandwich and potatoes from Coco Rico at a picnic in Parc Mont Royal, I swear. The chicken is moist and savoury and you want them to pour the hot sauce all over the chicken, the sandwich, the potatoes, everything, directly in my mouth if possible. There is little to no room to eat in here, but there are an awful lot of perfectly cute little potatoes roasting, and chickens just waiting for you to take them out on a date, to the park, heck take them straight home where yall can be alone..."}
{"text":"I came back last week after a first visit in 2009 and promising never to come back. The unpleasant rude girl is gone, probably for a long time, and has been replaced by another one with shaven head, a few tattoos here and there and a very friendly and courteous attitude. I bought a pork roast sandwich, potatoes and pork ribs to go and the food was very good, the pork was juicy and the ribs were crispy outside and tender inside. I ordered a slaw that looked curiously and overly green (I wonder if it glows in the dark, maybe the cabbages were imported from Fukushima) and did not taste natural, so I am staying away from it. I am updating my review and giving it two more stars because I am fair with my ratings and they deserve them....and yes, I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom... Portuguese chicken! Coco Rico is one of the best places in the city for chicken!  I went in for a quick Chicken Sandwich before watching a football match in Champs across the road, and I was surprised by the awesomeness of the chicken here. You can smell the juiciness and tastiness of the chicken when you walk in, and the taste is no less amazing.   They cut the meat from the chicken right in front of you, and they are FAST when they do it. These guys are good with knifes.   By the way, don't expect super service as it's an authentic, ethnic store."}
{"text":"Love this place. The chicken and potatoes are delicious. Try the spicy version. The ribs are super tender and the rolls are to die for. Menu is in French but they speak English as well."}
{"text":"The lady at the front was very dishonest, how she treated her customer.  I went in for a whole chicken,  she tried to promote the pork ribs to me, keep asking me 2 time about the ribs. So, I said okay for a small portion and weights it and told me it was 10.49. And she keep asking should I want to cut the ribs, at first I said no. But, she keep saying after she brush the BBQ sauce, I can't cut it anymore..so I said okay to cut the ribs. Guess what ? when I want to pay for  my food ..now she charges me at 12.99. I stead of 10.49.? I asked why? She said she has to charged me for to cut the ribs.. what it is now? She is a liar !! Don't go to that store! It is not about the $2.00..it is not the way you do business and how she treated customer like this! Beware of her! I just think this is not right, and people should know about it."}
{"text":"The star of the show here is the Roasted Chicken.....The place is mostly a take out joint, but there is a counter where you can sit and  enjoy your meal.  Dozens of roasted chickens are always being cooked in their two large rotisserie machines and  they look great..  We had a quarter plate with potatoes and salad....the meat was moist and well seasoned...tasty with a nice spicy kick to it....The potatoes were tender and not too salty...  They also have ribs but everyone we saw was having the chicken...so we decided to give the poulet a try....it was a good choice !"}
{"text":"we had more than a few places marked must have while in Montreal for the race, and one of them was the other infamous,... Portuguese chicken.   we tried another place a few days later, but the best for me was cocka-doodle-do. every bite was just shake your head goodness. the dark meat was super moist, juicy,... and that garlic sauce slather... one brush is never enough. the potatoes were also something else, caramelized and full of the chickens fat drippings. combine both and its one of the two food things in Montreal i wished we had in Southern California."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for chicken, this place is a good bet. The price is right but the chicken is a little dry and the portion is not as impressive as Ma Poule Mouillé. But, if you're in the area and are hungry, for just a few dollars you can fill your belly up and don't skip out on the natas! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Was walking on st Laurent street and felt the need for some Portuguese grub. Stumbled on Coco Rico. Never ate there although my in laws are Portuguese and we always go in that area for food. I was pleasantly impressed by the chicken. It is cooked on an open flame while rotating carefully to have every inch of it perfectly juicy. Their potatoes dipped in the spicy sauce is also quite good. Their salad is either coleslaw or garden salad with Italian dressing, that kind of disappointed me. Portuguese salad dressings are to die for, hopefully they'll get some in the future. You can finish off your dish with a nice Sumol. It's basically Portuguese orange crush but way better."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place is so highly rated...  Between my friends and I, I had a chance to try their chicken and pork. Both meats were dry - the chicken was definitely not authentic portuguese, and the pork chop must have been sitting on a stove all day because the bottom of it had been completely blackened and the whole thing was as dry as leather.  However, the amazing potatoes saved this from being a 1-star review."}
{"text":"Les restos portugais sont réputés pour la qualité de leur poulet. Et bien Coco Rico ne fait pas exception à la règle ! Voici donc une charmante petite rotisserie située en plein coeurs du quartier portugais de Montréal (voisin du légendaire Schwartz's).   Coco Rico se démarque de ses confrères nationaux par le mode de cuisson du poulet. Ici, la volaille est cuite à la broche, et non sur charbon de bois comme la tradition portugaises l'oblige. Cela n'empêche pas le poulet de Coco Rico d'être tendre et succulent, au contraire ! Non seulement le poulet est une réussite mais les portions sont généreuses.  J'enlève une étoile car l'endroit est surtout un comptoir pour apporter. Il y a bien une série de chaises hautes alignées le long d'un petit comptoir pour manger sur place, mais le confort est limité. En plus, le va et vient des clients enlève au plaisir de relaxer en mangeant.   Je recommande le spécial demi-poulet avec salade de choux et patates pour moins de 10$. Un très bon prix pour un poulet de qualité supérieure. N'oubliez pas d'accompagner votre repas avec un petit pain portugais pour un supplément de 0.50$. Il est croustillant et délicieux."}
{"text":"I recommend the chicken sandwich and ribs. Pork plate is not very charming."}
{"text":"The chicken is good, the potatoes could do with a crispy texture because as it is they're pretty soft. Also the ratio of flavour:potato isn't great; they should probably cut them in half!"}
{"text":"Small, no frills place with very tasty chicken! First time going there, I ordered a quarter chicken and was given the breast by default (50 cents more than leg), came with delicious mini potatoes and macaroni salad (around 7$ a meal) My companion got a combo meal with chicken, ribs and porkchop (12$) however he said the pork was too dry.  My chicken was nice and moist although I wish there was a bit more sauce. I opted for the non-spicy alternative.  They also have cherry cola which is one of my favorites. A nice touch!  Service is excellent. We were there a bit before 7 and there were continuous lines of people but everything was moving quick. Staff makes the effort of greeting and thanking each one.  Overall great chicken and value for portion size. Just wish this place was a bigger and had actual tables to sit down and eat, instead of a counter and stools."}
{"text":"Chicken and ribs were so good and cheap!   (we even snuck  in some Schwartz's take out from next door for an insane meat fest without the crowds)"}
{"text":"If the line-up at Schwartz's is too long, come here instead. Seriously.  The rotisserie chicken here is amazing, the skin alone is super-crisp and the meat inside is juicy and not dried out at all. That's a sign of chicken-done-right. Make sure you ask for the spicy sauce to be brushed on as well.  I've brought friends from overseas here and they still rave about the chicken and the roasted baby potatoes. Ribs are so-so and I haven't tried their ham or roasted pork but the patrons I do see order those items always clean up their plates.  The creamy coleslaw is also quite stellar. If you still have room, their egg custard tart desserts are also worth it!"}
{"text":"great ribs, very well barbecued, nice caramilization and crust. for the salad they can be a more generous."}
{"text":"Solid rotisserie chicken. I went here because Ramados was closed due to a fire. It was my first Portuguese chicken experience in Montreal. I dig the simple, straightforward, approach. Expectations were met. Not \"blow your mind awesome\", but rock-solid for sure."}
{"text":"The chicken was good. This is rotisserie chicken not cooked on a grill/fire. I would not considered this Portuguese chicken. I enjoyed the creamy coleslaw. Beware they charged 50 cents for an extra plate. Really?! Are they that hard up. Also the sitting is at a counter only. Takeout is prolly best."}
{"text":"Instead of waiting for 1 hour next door at Schwartz's, just come in here and get some awesome rotisserie chicken and spicy potatoes. AND - they are not ordinary potatoes!!!  The chicken is really tender and flavorful. The potatoes are whole mini potatoes that were slowly roasted. The vinegar-slaw is also very good.   To top it all off, get a Portuguese egg tart which is oh so creamy, rich, sweet, and yummy.   Honestly, this place gives Schwartz a run for its money."}
{"text":"I ordered a half chicken with potatoes and pasta salad.   The chicken breast was somewhat dry, just like St-Hubert chicken. It was poorly flavored and the skin was completely dried out. The spicy sauce did not taste much of anything. The chicken leg was moist, a tad tastier than the breast.  The potatoes were a bit sweet, and I didn't find its combination with the hot sauce very pleasant.   The pasta salad was greasy and tasted too much mayonnaise.  The 40¢ bread was really dried out and salty, at least Romados gives them for free.  As for the natas (egg tarts), the pastry was soggy... so I wouldn't recommend buying them.   If I gave Romados a 4/5, I'm going to have to rate this lower."}
{"text":"Montréal is full of excellent chicken. Coco Rico is rotisserie style and the dripping flavor the potatoes. It's been here forever and there is a reason why. Excellent flavorful chicken. Now they just started French fries which are up to my high standard. Make sure you get it spicy. They often have specials and portions are huge."}
{"text":"My heart (and stomach) is wavering: who has the better chicken in town? Romados or Coco Rico?  Romados' chicken is a bit smoky and has different layers of flavor (tangy. spicy) I'm literally biting and chewing on all the bones. Fries are delicious with the spicy sauce...And do they serve them by the bucket or something?  Coco Rico's chicken is a different specie. Bigger, juicy, and meat falls off the bone. It's less flavorful in terms of spices but it's so tasty. The potatoes melt in your mouth.  Finish off with a Portuguese egg tart :)  Romado's is better... No Coco Rico is.... No Romados... No Coco Rico... You get the picture!"}
{"text":"the way this placed was packed - you'd think they were giving away the chicken!    after a long day of enjoying the shops and boutiques in the area, it was almost dinner time and my mother and i were too tired to cook.  so when we passed by coco rico, we waltzed right in.  with an efficient and steady line to order and pay - it's more of a take out joint since the eat in venue can be crowded and no frills.  we ordered and devoured the spicy roasted chicken which was tender and juicy, with a big container of potatoes and a loaf of corn bread.  i'm sure there is a dry bird time to time with the sheer volume of business that they do but we were in the many lucky customers that got to enjoy a fast and easy meal!"}
{"text":"When you walk along St Laurent, or even St Dominique, and get to Napoleon street, you will get a whiff of something in the air,  The smell is of chicken, but not just any chicken COCO RICO chicken.  It has a sweetness to it and your mouth starts to water because you know your in for a great mouth full.    The crispy skin, browned just so, covering the juiciest pieces of chicken, that will fall of the bone and into your mouth, like a sacrificial virgin into a volcano, only willingly.     I only do the chicken (OK maybe some macaroni salad once in a while), and a Portuguese bun.    But the pork is also good for a taste, but a little on the pricey side, potatoes have never done it for me either they look good but then meh! you get a better deal with the whole chicken, don't even bother getting less.   Even if it is just for one, take it home you wont regret it and probably make friends as well.    Having tried several Portuguese chicken places I still say this one has it's own unique flavor and texture, and it's fast and easy to get so if your wandering along on St Laurent and you get the COCO breeze, walk  in and indulge.  Tip try this chicken with piri piri sauce, which can be bought in most grocery stores."}
