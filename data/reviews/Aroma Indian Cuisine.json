{"text":"This time South Indian for a change and it was extremely tasty. Chutneys and sambar were delicious."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from their buffet on 4/18. I was the first person through the doors at noon.  It's the only thing I've had all day, so I'm pretty sure it was them.  Normally pretty good when I order off the menu.  Be careful."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the positives. A friend and I had never tried Indian food before and saw all the good reviews for this place. The food was sooo good! The portion size was good and the spice level was just right. That being said I felt absolutely  out of place here. Our waiter  was nothing less than rude and unattentive. Anytime I would say thank you for anything he just looked at me...no your welcome or anything. I will say there were two gentlemen who did keep coming to check on us and I'm assuming they were owners or managers but they were the only reason we stayed. They were great. As good as the food was I will never go back."}
{"text":"The evening I stopped it was set up with a vegetarian dinner buffet as well as the a la carte menu options; I opted for the buffet.  Buffet options were good and fresh, but seemed somewhat lacking in variety.  They also had dosas made to order with a broad selection, but the dosa menu had no descriptions so selecting from the savory options was a shot-in-the-dark.    Overall, it was a good value but I would order off of the menu if I were to return."}
{"text":"Had the lunch Buffett and dinner ala crate several times.  Lunch buffet is all you can eat and 9 dollars and I must say is the best Indian buffet for lunch bar none! Dinners were also excellent.  Best Indian place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Aroma Indian Cuisine last night and was by far the best food my husband and I have had since moving to CLT 6 months ago. We ordered the following and it was enough for 2 adults with extra to bring home:   Lamb Roganjosh (w/rice) Chicken Tikka Kabob Garlic Naan Bread  We definitely recommend the Lamb Roganjosh with the Naan bread for dipping. Tasty flavors and delicious! The staff was kind and very attentive too. We will be frequent regulars in the future. Thank you for the wonderful experience AIC!"}
{"text":"I have lived in New York and California and both those states have there fair share of good Indian restaurants so I know good Indian food when I see it.. there chicken makhani with boneless tandoori chicken is amazing"}
{"text":"Food wasnt bad, however, the service was terrible. I would give the food 4 stars and the service 2 stars.  They didn't get our orders correct.  Food was not prepared on time, we waited for them to make one of the dishes order.  Just a complete waste of time ordering through Yelp with them.  Better to go in."}
{"text":"In from Texas craving Indian food and found Aroma. Food was excellent service was outstanding. When I return to the area I will come back."}
{"text":"Aroma briyani is the best in charlotte, thanks to Madhan and Sathish & the wonderful team behind it!!!"}
{"text":"The kashmiri naan was bland and burnt. The service was crap. Was there for thirty minutes when our waiter came back (after we fnished the naan) and asked if anyone had take our order. I clearly said no and he took our menus and walked away. I gave him sometime.assun was coming back and then went to the rgister nd requested to pay my tab and left. The floors we're greasy ad slick. The bathroom is down a storage hallway. The pappadums we're stale. All in all, the enire place was crap. I guess I will never be able to find good indian close to home."}
{"text":"Delicious buffet with good variety. This is one of the best Indian restaurant near concord mills. Tandoori chicken and chicken biryani was awesome. Ambiance is not that great but food is delicious."}
{"text":"Absolute best!  Yummy!  The best Indian food that we've ever had.  Cheers to the chef and the staff!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar butter chicken cooked to my spicy preference.  Buttered naan was an excellent accompaniment.  Entirely reasonable prices.  Highly impressed with friendly, assiduous service.  Nicely decorated with low level music and good lighting.  Very clean both in the seating area and bathroom.    I am most definitely coming back and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"Man, that was good!  Great service, Great food, Great experience! We rarely get to go out to eat so it's nice to have such a pleasant experience. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food...nay, amazing food. I've traveled all over and I was very pleasantly surprised of how good this place is. You have to try this if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food cooked to order. Huge menu selection that the helpful wait staff will gladly assist in navigating with you to find a dish that suits your cravings. I chose this restaurant after reading a review that said it was the best Indian food in Charlotte. I have not eaten at every Indian restaurant in town, but I can say that it is the best I have had in town so far and feel no need to search for anything better."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town for Great Wolf Lodge. Wanted to avoid the mediocrity of on resort dining and were very glad to find Aroma via Yelp. Service was very attentive, solicitous, and they were happy to steer us to dishes they feel they do well. There were many Indian families dining there too, which was an auspicious sign. Food was well prepared and flavorful. Definitely one of the better Indian dining experiences I've had.   It being suburban Charlotte, it's in a strip mall type location, so the ambiance isn't superior; but it's fine for what it is."}
{"text":"my wife and daughter and I came and had butter chicken and chicken tikka.  Our dinner was wonderful.  Service was fantastic and kept our drinks full.  We were checked on by managers and servers.  This place is the best Indian food on the Charlotte area.  Serving sizes are generous also"}
{"text":"Food quite good. Perhaps a few more non-spicy menu options would help. The service was super courteous and always available."}
{"text":"This was great food.  I've eaten a lot of Indian food around the US. This was really some of the best.  I had Chicken Biryanis and it was prepared very differently than in the past.  It had the same spices but the chicken was still on the bone and incredibly tender.  My bride had Chicken Curry with Cashews and Raisins. I tried her dish and again, excellent. Both dishes were very original. This place is very busy right up until 9. This place will be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Just concluded a very nice dinner with friends at Aroma. The services was outstanding, the naan was nice, thin and crisp and the chicken meat was flawlessly white and good.  The service was outstanding and all prices were very reasonable - approx $10.99 for most entrees.  I can highly recommend this restaurant!! Keep it up."}
{"text":"My husband & I went to Aroma Indian Cuisine when we went for a trip to Concord Mills-really close by and the food is really good & affordable (I know seriously-normally I am used to spending a LOT more for Indian Cuisine).  We had Bhindi Masala and Butter Chicken-and both dishes were delicious and plentiful.  I would come here again if I am in the area & would suggest anyone in the area to give them a try!"}
{"text":"Sunday lunch buffet is very good.. This is the best  place for South Indian food around Concord mall area. Desserts are generally too good !! Look out for Dosa mela on Tuesdays to enjoy 20 varieties of Dosa for just $10."}
{"text":"I have traveled across the country & Indian food is always one of my favorite cuisines to try. Ever since I have had the food (buffet & a la carte) from Aroma, I have fallen in love with the place. It is absolutely very authentic in its flavor, it always makes me feel as I'm eating my moms specialty dishes."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences i ever had in an Indian restaurant. We went as a group of 4 at around 1:45pm and had to leave in the middle of eating. I understand that we were late but the waiter was so rude and never even told us that there would be no more refills. Upon asking if he could refill the food, he sarcastically asked us how long we had been in US and have we ever been to an Indian restaurant at this time of the day. The way he asked and the tone were very displeasing and disrespectful. So, we had to leave in the middle. Would never go there again."}
{"text":"The manager at this restaurant knows how to run a great business. I came here twice within a week I think and second time I brought my entire family. The second time we came he recognized us and gave us a free dish to try! He was patient with us when we were ordering since he could tell we were new to the type of food. He was also very helpful in telling us portion sizes and what to order off the menu.   I will definitely try to stop here for dinner anytime I'm in the area. My favorite dish was the vindaloo chicken! It was probably the best cooked chicken I have ever had. Compared to other Indian restaurants I have tried in Charlotte, this is my favorite one!"}
{"text":"Great food & very courteous service. Had been to the Concord mills shopping mall & decided to get some good Indian food since we don't have many options where I live. No regrets going here for dinner. The chicken 65 is great and so is the chicken Biryani. Will definitely visit here the next time I'm in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and the staff was wonderful and so friendly! The wait staff suggested a few entrees for us to try.We didn't have to wait long to be served. The decor is nice and relaxing. I'll come again!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is the best South Indian food in US. I travel a lot and have done a lot of Indian places including big names in LA, NY city and Dallas etc. No place beats this.   Very true to the name, Aroma of spices and fresh cooking is evident as soon as you step the foot in the door. Spacious, open, well lit and great food/customer service. Wow!"}
{"text":"My husband and I drive from Charlotte to eat at Aroma. We love Indian food, and Aroma has the best Indian food that we've ever had. The staff is very friendly and attentive, and the service is great. You should definitely ask Kumar for suggestions on what to order! We cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The food was good especially Paneer Tikka. Cooked perfectly in the tandoor. Garlic naan was good. Egg masala was too delicious. A satisfying meal."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Indian restaurant in Charlotte area. Always great food and good service."}
{"text":"Worst worst worst customer service during weekends  We order and waiting for food for more then 45 mins like a fool And they still don't pay attention worst staff don't apologize for delay  Pls place some trained staff with etiquettes and teach them rules of hospitality service Never coming back here though food taste good but not coming back due to pathetic service"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is a great value! Tasty, fresh, spiced well and lovingly prepared food with attentive service and comfortable eating environment. Stopped by passing through Charlotte and will definitely visit again on a future trip!"}
{"text":"I like to eat Indian food after spending some time in Northern India. I really enjoyed my food here.  Just right!  Cold beer and  great Indian food is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"This is our second time having the buffet at Aroma.  Great food. Fast, friendly service. One of the employees was super nice and explained a dish to me that I had never seen before. That was the highlight of this trip for me.  :)"}
{"text":"We went here to have dinner on a sunday night and the place was bustling with people. There was a large party already and we were skeptical about the service we would get. But the service was very quick and friendly.  The food was delicious. The spices were used in the right amounts and no single flavor was over powering. We had the Baby corn Manchurian for appetizers and absolutely loved it. The Aloo Gobi and the Bhindi masala were amazing too. The portions were plentiful.   We left happy and are certain to go back to this place to try out more of their great tasting food."}
{"text":"I had dined with my colleagues last week and it was the worst Indian food I had for years! Restaurant looks good but staff rude for no reason.  It appears the server (not sure his name but thin guy with square glasses on) had an issue with inside staff and showing that on the customer.  I thought of getting out after seeing his behavior.  But there is another server who took care of us at the main course.  I don't recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"The worst Indian Food I had so far in Charlotte. We ordered Gobi 65 and it was really bad just dip of cauliflower drenched in food colour and deepfried . It has no taste. We just let it go off after our first bite.The chicken chettinadu that we ordered was not even chettinaadu and it is very very very salty so we were unable to even eat that curry Finally we ordered Goat Biryani and it is worst Goat biryani I ever tasted . The only part of food that is edible was Garlic naan which we could not eat because curry we ordered was salty. We didnot even ate 10%  of total food we ordered had to wait for good 45 min for orderes and walk out empty stomach. Never coming Back again."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Aroma.. After Persis and passage to India and tulips.. This restaurant has so much better variety of foods.. My friends were so happy because I took them there on my wife's birthday party.. Awesome food n great service... Server was checking on us all the time.. We ordered desserts at last when server forced us to try it.. It was delicious and best experience for everyone.. It was really memorable birthday of my wife.. Definitely going back to Aroma..."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we took a chance on this place. This restaurant has been opened under several different names and has always served Indian cuisine. If I'm right this is the third iteration and it looks like they finally got it right. Now being run by a husband and wife team , we first stopped by for dinner on a Tuesday night having just finished a bit of shopping. I ordered lamb vindaloo and my wife had a vegetarian dish. We were asked how spicy we like our food to which we both responded the hotter the better. Well what a surprise ..there was actually a good bit if heat, but not so much that the flavors were masked.  Since that first visit we have been back for the lunch buffet on several occasions. Always plentiful and seems to have a nice rotation of items including a couple of deserts with at least one being gluten free.  This is definitely a notch or two above the other Indian buffets in the area.  Also the service is better than many ethnic restaurants in the area, our drinks are topped off regularly and table is kept clear, I know that doesn't sound like much but it is nice not to have to flag a wait person down . Just to give you a better idea of what to expect , we visited one time( Dosa night ,more about that in a moment ) and there was not a wheat free desert on the bar for my wife. The owner brought my wife a bowl of warm carrot halwa, lightly sweetened and one of the wife's favorites. He earned a lot of points that evening !  Now for the previously mentioned Dosa night. Every Wednesday night these light crispy crepes are served ( 20 varieties ) along with an abbreviated hot bar ,  with  a nice selection of  sauces for your dosas. The best part is the dosas are made to order. The waiter will ask for your selection from the menu and will bring you 4 at a time. Wednesday nights have become dosa night for the wife and I. At $10 each it is a bargain for dinner.     So if you are in the area and looking for something other than ordinary chain restaurant.... This is the place."}
{"text":"This place was an solutely wonderful! Vegetable Samosa were delicious, Tikki Marsala was amazing!   The staff was really attentive but never annoying.   We will certainly be back to try their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Extensive buffet - only a few too spicy for my Midwest palette- plenty of choices - friendly, attentive service"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. But the idli was hard as rock and the biriyani was definitely a no to have. Guess it was not a fresh food. The dosa served was good. The chicken curry was so good and when I went to back for a refill it was filled with another color chicken curry which did not taste good at all! Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were traveling through and researched the area beforehand. We picked an awesome restaurant!!! We had a hot spicy chicken dish (my husband loved the hot spice - recommended by our server) and I had a vegetarian dish (eggplant). Very flavorful, the service was excellent, and we would definitely be back if we lived in the area. Some Indian places miss out on the flavor but this place had very deep spices and a great variety of options."}
{"text":"I had one of the lamb dishes (can't remember which one) with a tomato based sauce and basmati rice. It was great but the highlight of my meal was the naan. I could have had a meal with just naan and been completely happy. It's that good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service. All chicken appetizers tastes identical.  They tried to claim they no longer accept the Yelp 10% off."}
{"text":"Came out here on Friday night with a group of amazing fellow Yelpers. I knew we were in the right place because the second you walked through the door, you were hit with this amazing smell (dare I saw Aroma haha) of Indian food deliciousness!  Started off with a glass of vino, which was a nice pour. Many people got a popular Indian beer. Tried it and it was super tasty.  Whenever I go to Indian restaurants with Yelpers, I always let Tonya P. do the ordering! So a group of 4 of us split a ton of stuff. Channa bhatura, paper masla dosa, baby corn manchurian, regular naan, garlic naan, kashmiri naan, dal makhani, aloo gobi fry masala, butter chicken, chicken chettinadu (yes, I copied this from another review. No judgement!). My favorites were the Channa Bhatura as the bread was just so fluffly and fun! The garlic naan....delicious garlic and buttery goodness. The dal was another awesome choice and made delish leftovers the next morning. However, the winner for the evening was the butter chicken. Ya'll, this dish is absolutely incredible! I dipped all the naan in this sauce!  Fantastic service dealing with our large party combined with incredibly delish food is a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"We ordered mysore masala dosa and chicken dum biryani. Dosa was thin and crisp. Sambhar and stuffing was good. Biryani had good flavor but can make it better. Didnt like the curry that came with biryani but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the best indian Restaurants in North Charlotte area. They serve awesome north indian and south Indian food. In addition to the food, the service and staff is too good. In particular Shahid and Ashwin are my favorites. They will make sure that dine-in or take out order meets your requirement. Please try Samosa chat..not on the menu..but is awesome...the best curry dish I like is Goat curry and obviously can't go wrong with idli..they do run out of it as it is too good.  Last but not the least..my mother visited from India and was willing to eat tadka daal and roti here every time we came here.  Also they offer complimentary rasmalai to their repeat customers!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here today and was completely satisfied. The spice levels were as we requested and the quality of food and service were excellent. Lamb chettinadu and moghlai chicken curry were authentic and the best was the fish fry.. Which was worth waiting   A star less for veggie dishes that were just satisfactory.  I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent food and service. The food may take a little longer to get to your table but it's obvious that its because they make these complex dishes to order. Well worth the wait. Best Indian food in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Food taste was good but very bad hygiene ... We found hair in curry and spoons not cleaned properly... No one in kitchen using cap or hand gloves... When these are notified management didn't even reacted..."}
{"text":"Such great indian food for a really good price! They have good standards like tiki masala but also really authentic food like this amazing cauliflower appetizer that was recommended but not on the menu! Super friendly and great service.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Wow that dal makhni and kadhai paneer... I had that Indian taste after such a long time. The naans were also very good.  I am definitely going there again."}
{"text":"Aroma has some of the best, authentic, Indian food around. I had the lamb saag and the garlic nan. I have to say I've been here a couple of times and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"They have a buffet at lunch time and a full menu at dinner. The buffet is a great stop over and this is the only Indian food in the Concord Mills area. They have truly first rate Indian food. The service is great too. Dinner here is really good. I like the Chicken Marsala, it was delicious and just the right amount of spiciness.  This is one of my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Aroma. The food is AMAZING!! All the meats are very tender and all the food is full of flavor. The deserts... You gotta be sure to have them because they are mouth watering. The service is some of the very best in the area.  No exaggeration here. Once you go and have the experience yourself, I assure you, you'll agree!!"}
{"text":"Traveling alone the temptation is always there to simply grab something fast and head back to the hotel.  I confess I was using yelp to find a quick solution when I came across Aroma.  I recently had a great experience at a top rated Indian restaurant in London, so I  decided to give this restaurant a try.  Am I glad I did!!  The menu is large and the waitress/owner gave me some help.  EVERYTHING I had was outstanding.  The service was also great.  I was pleased to see that on a Wednesday night they were busy. I cannot recommend this place enough.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food that is a good blend of Andra style with Chettinad flavors. The North Indian food is equally amazing. Strongly recommend the Dosa crepes and the chicken chettinad is simply exemplary. Finish that with a nice fresh lime soda or a cold kingfisher beer. The mirchi ka Salan (a curry that exemplifies the southern chili at its heart) can be prepared by the chef at medium spicy while still retaining amazing flavors."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, portion was perfect, price was on point. Would defiantly come back again."}
{"text":"I am not the most experienced when it comes Indian food. When I asked do assistance in my choice my waiter was very helpful and suggested a wonderful dish that was just the right amount heat for me. Everything was very good and the staff was very attentive during my meal. They seem very interested in you having a positive experience. I would and will recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and service is great! Went with my family on a Saturday night, and we got seated right away.  Full bar.  The Tandoori and Vindaloo were both excellent. Only 4 stars due to some failing decor."}
{"text":"Was there with a bunch of girls for their weekend buffet and I have to appreciate their service. Considering that we were a group of almost  50, Aroma still managed to make it comfortable for us as well as the other guests.  I would rate the food as 4-star. Very nice starters- samosa chaat especially. Some of the dishes were way too salty- sambhar and some chicken curry. But the overall taste and freshness of food was good. And the fruit drink (included in buffet) needs special mention. Loved it.  The food layout was a little confusing though. 2 desserts at the start and 2 at the end confused the guests. One anyway does not  expect 4 desserts at Indian buffets ;)   Definitely going back some time soon!!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have experienced in the U.S. Period. I have eaten Indian food all across the U.S while traveling for work, NYC, LA, Kansas City, Miami, SC, San Francisco. This was the best tasting food, just right in every respect. I'm from UK, we have Indian restaurants on every street in every town, I hadn't matched them here in the US until this place.  The Crepes with spiced mash potato served with veg curry were outstanding.  Had butter chicken, the meat melted in your mouth, not the normal \" chicken thrown into a sauce & still just tastes of chicken except for the outer coating\" this chicken was marinated & cooked in tandoor then put in the curry sauce.  This place is a definite \" do not miss \"   Do they need somebody at the door when you come in?? It would be a recommendation but to me the wait was totally worth it. I do my reviews based on the food quality, cleanliness & service once sitting down.  Do not miss this one."}
{"text":"Great service! The waiter was very friendly and helpful when it came to me choosing my main course!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant awesome food awesome. Top indian restaurant in and around Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best dosa in the Charlotte area. The quantity is bigger than any other place in this area, NYC or bay area. Totally worth the price. I tried Rawa dosa and plain dosa, they were delicious!!"}
{"text":"They simple nail every single Indian dish. The seasoning is subtle and varied, but with plenty of heat. Great chicken 65. The kids loves it as did my wife and I (seasoned Indian food eaters). We stop here when traveling through almost every time."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food!  Visiting from LA, I decided to give it a shot.  It was so good, I came back a second time.  Very reasonable prices, sizable menu, and very authentic.  Try the Chicken Chettinadu- outstanding."}
{"text":"Second visit here and upgrading my review from 4 stars to 5 stars. The food here is ridiculously good. My wife and I were the only non - Indians dining on our second visit. Kinks in the service from the first visit have been worked out. The menu is huge. Ask for advice as necessary.  I am now looking for excuses to go to Concord so I can eat here again. And again."}
{"text":"I went there the other day with my boyfriend. They seem to be under new management and he was extremely nice to us and they had new people. The portions are large and delicious. I highly recommend this Indian buffet during their lunch hours for all you Indian food lovers. The restaurant is very clean and lovely as well. This is now our favorite buffet in the area. The food is the perfect amount of spicy. I always get the chicken tikka masala with white rice and naan."}
{"text":"We had celebrated my son's first birthday party last weekend. We catered the food from Aroma and the menu included couple of starters, veg and non veg main course and a dessert. Few of the crucial nuances which delighted us are as follows  1) The restaurant owner, guided me and helped me in estimating the food tray size needed to cover the number of people expected.  2) I opted to pickup the food from the restaurant and I was provided with the food stacked and neatly loaded into a large hotcase at the promised time. 3) Food was piping hot and neatly packed into trays 4) Stands and serving spoons also was provided.  5) Excellent feedback regarding the taste of the food from my guests.  I would recommend Aroma catering for any party irrespective of the size based on my experience. Thank you for being professional and Thorough.  Regards, Sujith"}
{"text":"Was here Thursday as soon as I walked in I felt like the food was going to be bad the guy at the door shirt was dirty the floor was dirty the place overall looked nice nobody was to friendly they did not have any tea the food on the buffet looked good but was super flavorless the tandoori chicken was dry it tasted old actually all the meat tasted low budget the sauces was nasty no flavor the Naans was hard I definitely won't go back"}
{"text":"Went today with my wife and kids to try this highly rated restaurant. Had the lunch buffet, and it was great! There was a nice variety that left the whole family very satisfied. The service was excellent as well. I am already looking forward to getting back there soon."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  New to the area and wanted something different...I wanted Indian hubby was indecisive. We had Chicken Tikka Marsala...delicious.  Onion Dosa...very fresh- onions cooked to gentle crunch and lamb chops grilled to a tasty crisp!  Naan - yummy...worth the visit.  We'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Awesome flavors, very fresh ingredients, great prices, super nice waiters, we was treated like family. We definitely recommend this restaurant and we will be back for lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Eat Here! Great food, outstanding service, very good selection. Not sure what or how to order?  No worries the staff recommendations will exceed your expectations!"}
{"text":"WOW! BEST. INDIAN. CUISINE. I have EVER HAD! I highly recommend their battered cauliflower appetizer (Gobi Manchurian), Chicken Korma, ANY of the Naan bread and the Gulab Jamun for dessert. OUTSTANDING food as well as very attentive, informative and friendly service!  We based our dinner choice here on the reviews that Aroma received and are VERY pleased with our choice. We will be returning frequently!"}
{"text":"We were driving through concord and saw that this place had excellent reviews so we decided to try it. This is one of the best Indian restaurants we have ever been to!  The service is very fast and friendly! The menu is large with a variety to choose from. The price and value of the food was excellent. We got the chicken 65 appetizer which was crispy, super tender and extremely flavorful!  we also ordered the chicken Tikka Marsa and the chicken korma both of which were amazing. The portions were perfect and we both were very full and happy to have left overs to take home. The Naan was also delicious! We will definitely eat here every time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome food and very authentic. The menu was just a bunch of plain white paper with a staple in the corner. Would have been nice to see some pictures of the offerings and the decor could use a little make over. Those are the only areas for improvement though. Awesome food and very authentic, but then I repeat myself...but it deserves repeating."}
{"text":"Dosa buffet sucks! their plain dosa was soggy even after repeated plea to make it crispy. Service isn't their thing either. Place was pretty loud too. Overheard a waiter abusing a customer from another table in Hindi. Overall a no-no for me."}
{"text":"I have been here for more than 10 times and recent visits are not satisfactory. This time I came on Friday for lunch. The roast chicken and goat curry never got refilled (empty for an hour!). At one time, no meat was on the food island. I feel like the owner has determined to control the cost by stopping refilling food.  Their food taste great. Just no (low frequency) refill."}
{"text":"Food was very good- tried everything from South Indian to Punjabi ( North Indian) dishes. Service was quick and attentive. I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for the first! The food was good and the price was reasonable as well. And the restaurant is very close to the Concord Mills Mall so very convenient location. Definitely worth coming back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service. Asked for a small spoon for my kids to use and they gave us teeny tiny spoons, but my kids were delighted so all is good."}
{"text":"Almost missed this hidden gem! The food was astonishing, truly amazing, best Indian food I've ever tasted! Short of going to India this is some of the best food you can get. The tandoori chicken is packed with rich flavors, the samosas are piping hot and flaky, and the garlic naan is to die for! Also the butter chicken and aloo gobi are cooked in a savory aromatic sauce. A definite \"Must-Stop-By\" place if you like Indian or just want to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Totally redeemed. Not sure what the deal was last time but Aroma has returned hopefully for good to its previous form."}
{"text":"The aroma of Indian food made my mouth water the minute I walked through the door. Dimly lit and nicely decorated with dark wooden seating and beautiful paintings, Aroma Indian Cuisine is both modern and cultural at the same time.   The waiters were unbelievably charismatic, attentive, and helpful. They came by multiple times to ask how I was doing doing, if my food was okay, and if there was anything I needed. I felt not only welcomed, but also valued as a customer and that only made my dinner taste all the more delicious.   For my entree, I chose the chicken chettinadu, a curry with boneless chicken that was spiced with traditional herbs, and vegetable samosa for an appetizer. I also got a basket of fresh naan. At first, there was a slight mix up with my order, causing a tiny delay, but the waiter instantly brought out another fresh basket of naan and a bowl of basamti rice to apologize for the wait. That was already more than enough for me and I greatly appreciated the sincerity of his actions.  As I waited for my food, complimentary flat bread was served with two types of chutneys, a green chutney made of mint that was spicy, and a brown chutney that was sweeter, cooling my mouth after taking a huge bite of the green one. I also love the cumin seeds in the flat bread, giving it a nice toasted flavor.    While the samosa was spiced well, it was certainly a lot heavier than I anticipated. It was stuffed with vegetables and a chickpea filling that had you feeling full before you even finished one. I did, however, like how crispy the outer layer was without being oily or greasy.  The chettinadu curry might not have had the most appetizing color, looking more like a muddy green, but the smell was out of this world, I took one bite of the chicken and closed my eyes as I enjoyed the tender meat and the spice that hit the back of my throat all the way up to my nose. Even when I was already super full, I could not stop eating the curry with the fresh, warm naan. What a combo!   There's no denying that Indian food is spicy and fragrant, but it's the service at Aroma Indian Cuisine that really won me over. It's one thing to enjoy delicious food, but it's another thing entirely to feel so comfortable that you want to stay there forever.  I already can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with very attentive service. Very reasonably priced.  The staff is very helpful explaining the menu."}
{"text":"Came in late and they were very welcoming. Food was great and the entire staff checked on us to ensure we enjoyed everything. If you've never had one, you should try a mango lassé."}
{"text":"Asked our waiter,  Ashwin, for recommendations and was blown away with the food!  Excellent flavors and huge portion.  Wonderful customer service. Will definitely visit here again!"}
{"text":"Do NOT order out from here. It is always over an hour from the time you call. This place is getting worse every time we go. Sangam in Cornelius is twice as far but at this point worth the drive."}
{"text":"Very bad service and attitude of the manager.  I visited this place with my friend (total 9) on Friday and my over all experience was really bad.  Initial service: We entered the menu around 8:40 and were not served water for ateast 10-15 mins. Later we had to ask them for menu cards and when we did, i saw the lady collecting menu from other tables and then getting them for us. I wonder how poor planning it is on a restaurant side to not have adequate menu even when the hotel is not completely occupied.  Appetizers: We ordered appetizers (just 3 dishes) and those took around 35-40 mins to come. It was only after we ordered appetizers we were served with welcome snack (papad) and that too just one plate with 4 pieces for a party of 9.   Plates/Silver ware: It was after we ordered appetizers we were given dinning plates and that too only half of us were given the plates. It was only after we asked for more and reminded them that we were not given plates that they bought more plates and silver ware for us.  Main course: While waiting for appetizers, we though of saving time and ordering main course and requested the lady taking the order to please server us as early as possible since we had to watch a movie at the theater right opposite. We ordered main course and 15 mins after that we got our appetizers. It was almost more than 45 mins that we were not served dinner and we had to leave the place.  When we went to the register to pay for the bill of what we had, we were told by the manager that your food is ready, please take it (its on the house). When one of my friends asked what do we do with it, we are not allowed to take it in the theater, the manager replied, you can throw it. The manager insisted that we do no pay for whatever we had but we didn't felt it right and wanted to pay and that is when we were told by their staff that their computer system is not working properly, its very slow etc etc, i am unable to do the billing.  In between this, one of my friends who had ordered south indian snack instead of proper meal was served well along with our appetizers. I also noticed that there were few other guests who came in after us (i was able to identify atleast 2 tables with more than 2+ guests on each) who were served food at the same time when we were served our appetizers. It looks like if one orders any south indian dishes are served well in time but if you are a bigger party and order dal, sabji etc then better be ready to spend your whole evening there as these guys think that you are here to spend the whole evening with them.  Over all, not recommended at all for proper dal, sabji type of food and for larger parties. if you have free time, you may want to try it out and see if you are served well and in time.  ALL THE BEST and hopefully you will not have to come out of the restaurant after one and a half hour and that too EMPTY STOMACH."}
{"text":"Spice9 always  had terrible service, when we heard they reopened we had hoped it would be better. The service was absolutely horrible, then I was told by an employee the servers are paid minimum wage and ARE NOT allowed to keep their tips!!!! No wonder the service is so horrible. My friends and I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Best Sunday buffet in the two cities of Charlotte and Concord!    Every week they change 80% of the buffet on Sunday so you never get bored.   And the attention to Customer Service was outstanding.      Good for them.  Fresh ingredients and perfect atmosphere.    Loved it.   Pat & Ali Hughes"}
{"text":"Excellent Desi (Indian)food. The lunch buffet was varied and wonderful and their Dosas were out of this world. Paper soda was super crispy and sambhar just right! I highly recommend this restaurant. Staff is friendly, service was prompt!!"}
{"text":"Perfect as always :-) Wonderful freshly prepared variety of Indian foods and fresh dosa daily!!! My favorite spot for delicious Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Butter chicken is the best.  The chicken is so moist and tender.  I often eat butter chicken off of the buffets because it seems to be a staple everywhere, but here I ordered it as an entree and it was so much better.  I like it mild, they really made it mild.  This is the first Indian restaurant that truly respects mild.  Hubby was a bit sad that his medium was a little less than medium.  On the downside they charge for buttered naan, it is only .49 more but that is an unusual upcharge.  The proprietor is extremely friendly and worth a good chat.  The portions were of average size, plenty of meat in the chicken dish, but not true of the goat dish.  The korma here is a little less nut and rich but still has plenty of flavor.  If you want more rice they will bring it without hesitation.  has the best ambience, no tv, and no blaring loud Indian music.  The polar opposite of Persis."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, best selection of freshest food of any Indian buffet in town. Everything I tried was tasty, and the staff was very attentive. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We have dined-in for dinner and have gotten takeout and was not disappointed either time. Our waiter did check on us a few times but wasn't very chatty, which we are fine with, but our orders came prompt and everything was delicious. I had the lamb curry and it was amazing. We even tried the Gulab Jamun and loved it. I had never tried anything like it but the consistency and flavor was so good. This place is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Best indian in charlotte, the food and buffet have been consistently great as well as the service.  No need to try anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food is great ! Nice staff. Only thing I would say is your cutlery needs to be improved and little brighter ambience would be great !  Strongly recommend the naan and kofta curry !!  I will come back for the great food !"}
{"text":"Their food is awesome! The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because one time I placed an order for pickup and when I arrived 45 minutes later, they didn't have it and they were very confused as to why not and I had to wait awhile before they gave it to me. Also, I've noticed that when I order extra rice on the side, they skimp on that. You should get a container of rice and a box of rice, and they just give you the box. When you're paying that much extra for rice, they really should give you extra. Sometimes it's hit or miss. Usually miss."}
{"text":"I'm torn, I experiences Aroma at restaurant week.  I was super jazzed to find out they were located right around the corner from my house.  I went about a week after restaurant week and it was just meh.  Firstly for take out it took an inordinate amount of time.  Like the quoted me 30 minutes - ok I'll take one for the team and go to the mall to kill time - but when I got there I still waited another 15 minutes.  My food was good. I had the chicken tikka and the samosas (? the fried potato appetizer).  While the food was good, it wasn't like the restaurant week street food.  I also found the portions to be small and not a good value.  I will go back one more time for the buffet.  I think that's the better value."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was delicious. My go to meal for Indian is Chicken Tikka Masala and this was one of the best I've ever tasted. The chicken was so tender it was as smooth as butter! The garlic naan was amazing. If we make it back to Concord will be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian places we tried and we tried a lot of them. The food was good and the price was really reasonable. It's a must try if you like Indian food."}
{"text":"Amazing Chai - best I have had and I have an Indian sister-in-law that makes chai for me all the time (hers now is in second place). We ordered a Dosa as an appetizer - which was a great idea. All of our entrees were excellent and the naan was great too. One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to anywhere."}
{"text":"Been to NC overweek to meet friends and it happened to order food for carry out from this place. Initially We were told that wait time is 20min but food was ready after 1hr wait. The quality of the food is very good and the restaurant ambiance is pleasant. Recommended for dine in."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet.  Wide variety of dishes.  Sambhar and idli, goat curry and chili chicken were outstanding."}
{"text":"Love their food!!!! We especially like Lamb Kachops and Tandoori chicken. If you are not sure what you like: try their weekend buffet, it will allow you to try different dishes at once. The customer service is always on point, no complaints. Favorite take out restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered Togo. Had a glass of wine while I waited. From my short time there, place smelled AMAZING! It looked like they had a dinner buffet. I ordered lamb rogan josh-hot. I would have liked it more hot but it was on point flavor wise. Would definitely recommend and/or try again."}
{"text":"We had Buffet today, so many items and really good improvement since our last visited, food quality was so good, good texture and good constancy In Gravy.  Kashmiri Mashroom, Chicken Butter Masala, Paneer Butter Masala all was so good in taste, Dhosa on table was also very nice, Golden Brown and Crispy.  After trying so many restaurant in Charlotte, Aroma is Probably the best base on their service, quality of food and value of your money."}
{"text":"Mediocre buffet and slow staff.  I was really looking forward to having an Indian restaurant in the area...sadly this restaurant is not worth returning to.  For the amount of money I paid, I expected a decent buffet, but the buffet was very sparse.  To make matters worse, the staff acted like they did not see my empty soda cup...and forget about asking for more pita bread.  At the end of the day, learn from my experience and spend your money at a place that will be worth it."}
{"text":"Checked out the lunch buffet.  They have a wide selection of dishes, most of them are pretty standard Indian fare, but still good.  I was surprised that some of them had a fairly decent amount of heat, to boot!  FYI:  They bring you a basket of naan to your table.  My complaints:  Servers were quite friendly, but my drink sat empty too long.  They had no onion chutney on the buffet.  Restaurant is tucked back into a corner of the shopping center, so it's a little hard to find.  Otherwise, I will be back, at least for the buffet."}
{"text":"This is so far the best dosa buffet I ever had and the price is freakingly reasonable! I would recommend everyone near by to surely visit this place."}
{"text":"Very good!!!  We stopped for a bite while Christmas shopping. They were busy but very attentive. They recommend some things we never had before and everything was great!!!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I placed a To Go order through the Yelp app a few days ago. I only had to wait about 10 minutes in the restaurant before my order was ready.  The interior is very nice and service seems to be great. I'll have to eat in next time.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala for myself and the Chicken Vindaloo for my boyfriend. We got both of the entrees spiced \"Medium\" just to be safe. The Tikka Masala could have used a little more heat. The chicken was moist and the taste was amazing. The Vindaloo was spiced to perfection and was so delicious. I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend's plate, it was that good.  I definitely recommend this restaurant if you like Indian and are in the area. If you've never had Indian before, do yourself a favor, and try it first here. This will definitely become a staple in our \"night out\" list of restaurants."}
{"text":"This is one of many restaurants in the Charlotte area which we have tried. This has by far been the best. I called Siri for restaurants and Aroma popped up with 4.5 stars. We tried it... The service was great friendly and clean cut. We ordered lamb kurma, chicken tikka masala and dal makhani which is one or more of the items we usually order at the other restaurants and a samosa for app. The food was prepared very well we ordered medium which was not quite hot enough but the flavor was still superb. We live in Waxhaw nc so this is about a 35 min drive for us with the other restaurants being closest we would drive the extra to go here it is that much better."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet, one of the best Indian ones I've been to. Most Indian buffets I've been to are fairly small and feature ok food, but the selection here is not only bigger, but also much tastier and an excellent value for the quality and price they charged. The crisp bread, a fried spongy dessert, and several of the curries were among my favorites, along with a refreshing drink at the buffet with spices in it. The waiter also gave us complimentary naan and dosa."}
{"text":"Looking for a place outside the normal in the Concord Mills area and ran across some great reviews on yelp for Aroma.  Me and my wife's food was delicious.  After the owner gave us some recommendations since we are not Indian food professionals we left with a full belly and very satisfied with the service!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really didn't have a chance to order from alcarte but they have the best Dosa Buffet in town. The ambiance is also good comparable to other Indian restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"15 minute wait turned into 30 minutes. I didn't realize the place was a buffet until we sat down. Air conditioning was broken (I know this is probably temporary. But still)   The food was slightly less than ok, I've had lots of Indian food on various levels of authenticity. And this was just...meh. The only thing I really liked was the Chicken Tikka Masala. Even the naan was blah."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch buffet! Best food we've had in a long time.  Every single thing was more delicious than the next.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Got a chance to try out aroma this past weekend. It was a welcome change from the previous Indian restaurants in the space. The menu was good and the flavors were nice.  The service was great!   The only thing off was that there is no background music, which made diners all around seem louder."}
{"text":"Almost 6 months since my last review and I'm still a fan of Aroma's lunch buffet. The service has been consistently friendly the years I've been coming and the food is still great. This time I tried what I believe is a carrot based dessert that was quite delicious, but not TOO sweet. I also enjoyed my usual favorites: fruit, butter chicken,  a veggie rice Biriyani ( I may be saying this incorrectly), and more. If you , like me, never grew up eating Indian food, give it a try during a buffet so you can sample new things, but not waste. I've really grown to love Indian cuisine's take on the vegetables and meats I already love."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet.  The food is excellent (especially the Tandoori Chicken), the atmosphere is very modern and clean, the service is extremely friendly and professional, and the price is great.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Such great hospitality and the food is delicious! This is my go to place for yummy curry! I love the buffet so many delicious choices! Hits the spot every time! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Lots of options on the lunch buffet, with and without meat, spicy and less spicy. All of it was great - I ate one plate and was so full, but I wished I could have eaten more! We had to wait a few minutes for our drinks, and the owner was so apologetic that he comped one of our meals. It was so kind, we really weren't bothered by the wait but he insisted! Good food, good people."}
{"text":"Eating here was a really amazing experience. The ambiance was quiet and relaxing. The staff were also very frienly. They usually ask you what level of spice you would like in your food. The food was fantastic. Make sure you order Beryani here. They use a good brand of Basmati rice I believe. We paid about $37 for three meals which is fair. They also have buffet for lunch. They serve beer and wine in case you would like to have some bioze with your spicy meal! I will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"I went 30 mins out of my way just to find out they are closing at 3 instead of 3:30 as advertised. Terrible service wouldn't even offer buffet to go which was still sitting there"}
{"text":"I was not going to this place frequently earlier, as it is quite far from where I live. Sometimes, some places are worth driving all the way when you get good stuff. There could be mixed reviews on customer service , but not once I was disappointed by the quality of food, very consistent. Remember they are closed on Mondays and I hit this place twice on Mondays"}
{"text":"Don't worry about what all of it is, just know it's all good!  I too had to warm up to Indian food a few years back, but once you develop a taste for it then places like Aroma stand out to you! A beautiful interior greets you as you walk in, as well as prompt courteous service!  Lunch is the time to go to sample many different dishes on their buffet.  I'll admit that even after several years of loving this cuisine, I still don't know what everything is and don't care!  It's full of spices and flavors that just wow you, but not set your mouth on fire!  There's no need to try to describe the different chicken and goat dishes, as I'm not sure if I really know!  You don't 4 1/2 stars after 100+ reviews if it's not good though!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I really mean it... Came here for the Sunday buffet.. And the food was amazing!!   One of the best spreads... With 4-5 starters, 2 types of mousse and decent variety of curries...  Will come back for sure!!! Big thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Best Buffet in the town!  Nice Ambiance and good food :)"}
{"text":"I love Indian food, so my expectations were very high. I have to say that this restaurant exceeded them. The food was incredible. The service was stellar. Our water glasses never got close to empty. The wait staff was patient with our questions and extremely kind and friendly. I had the butter chicken and loved it. We stared with vegetable samosas, also wonderful. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This place deserves the 5 stars. Seriously! Best Indian food I had, after long time.  I became vegetarian & fishatarian by choice and very often I run into Indian buffet with very limited options in vegetable curries. They have very decent selection in the vegetable and they have fish also for the buffet.  I went twice here, one time for the dinner and second time for the weekend buffet. I was delighted by their fish curry for dinner and I am happy to experience their weekend buffet. The best items out of all the good stuff they got, are fried vermicillm (sevayyan uma) and fried fish on the buffet. In fact, all the items in the buffet are good.  I hope they maintain this standard and probably similar menu or a better, in the future. I would love to come here again."}
{"text":"We went to Aroma on April Fool's day. We had to wait about 50 minutes and they still hadn't had the food ready yet. Someone told us to go here so we went and I guess we really did get fooled. The service is really bad, and the waiter never said sorry. We all got fooled"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. They have a vegetarian buffet Wednesday night and regular buffet during lunch time every day of the week. I have been to many Indian restaurants in the area and this is by far my favorite. I have been to aromas at least a dozen times and have never had bad food or bad service. I think sometimes when people leave bad reviews they are not familiar with Indian food and do not understand what they are getting. So I believe that one should have the buffet several times until they know what they like. I personally love their Biryani and anything with Paneer cheese. Lastly, The restaurant is always very clean."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!! Can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu. We had the Poori bread with a mashed potato dish - which was great. Our main meals, chicken tikka masala and baingan bharta (mashed eggplant) were delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually go on a Saturday or Sunday for the buffet . I especially love their soup Rasam. I would literally go just for that. The buffet has a pretty good selection. The service so is great. I usually only get the buffet and water so I can't speak for ordering a specific  meal or drink . The price Is very reasonable . I try to go here whenever I am out near Concord Mills! It's located in a shopping center like lot so there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet.  Everything was delicious!  Especially appreciated the vegetarian selection was large. Had two giant plates of food for a very reasonable price! Will definitely be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Dear Aroma, you just lost a customer, I dont know what happened, but you service has become really bad. I drove 20 miles just to eat here because Aroma used to maintain class, i went for friday buffet and it was aweful, at 1 pm they were out of almost everything. Place was heating like AC was turned off. Quality of food was so bad that I couldn't even eat anything properly. Either change manager , increase number of waiters or do something. Otherwise you will keep losing your customers. That passage to India seems better option now,this is my frustration level :)"}
{"text":"Aroma is probably o e of the best Indian cuisine establishments that I have visited.  1) The bathrooms were clean.  2)  The service was quite good. There was never an empty cup and anything we needed was brought right away. This is a nice relaxing place.   3) We ordered Masala Dosa. It was quite yummy. it was the first time that I have eaten a Dosa and I will make sure that I will in the future. The garlic sauce and tomato sauce were our favourite.  4) Egg Sum Biryani~ This was loaded in spices. it was not overpowering or overtly spicy. this was not my favorite of the dishes, but I would certainly eat this again.  5)  Chicken Chettinad ~ This came in medium and hot. I had the medium and was quite pleased. it was flavorful and quite delicious with naan bread.   Other notes : It has an easy parking lot."}
{"text":"Best outstanding Indian restaurant in Charlotte , especially their Lunch Buffet is good .."}
{"text":"All the food was quite good. The Andrah Chicken Curry was just right amount of spicy at the medium level. Prices are reasonable, but service can be a little slow. The wait staff was neither friendly, nor rude... I guess you could say they were indifferent. The gentleman that seemed to be the manager or owner was great though. He made sure we were happy with our food and was a pleasure to deal with. I'll be coming back for more Andrah Chicken Curry that's for sure."}
{"text":"Good food .. good service. We had buffet there and we like all the items.  May be they need more cleaning in common area or restroom during rush hours..."}
{"text":"It was my first real experience eating Indian cuisine and I loved it. Our group ordered the chicken masala, chicken korma, butter chicken, Dahl makhani, masala dosa, and garlic and butter naan. Everything tasted great (my favorite was the Dahl). I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love Indian food.  I checked this place out Friday during lunch.  There was a good amount of people in the restaurant but we were still sat right away.  I kept it simple and stuck with the butter chicken, jasmine rice, biriyani and naan bread.  I also tried a little of their goat and it was tasty also.    Our server was extremely nice and made conversation with my husband and I.  Overall, I would say this was an above average visit for Indian."}
{"text":"First off, not one staff member has any personality whatsoever. No smiles, no checking to see how things are, no byes etc. We went for the buffet and the food was absolutely the worst Indian food I've ever had, and I've been to several in Charlotte as well as different cities. The buffet itself is filthy and what put the icing on the cake was witnessing one girl giving her little sister a bite of food from the buffet serving spoon. Yes, she put her mouth in the spoon and then put it back into the food. Disgusting!!! I will never frequent this establishment again."}
{"text":"We moved into our new home in Highland Creek from Chattanooga, TN and were tired and hungry. Aroma hit the right sensory notes. Our son and his girlfriend joined us. Our son had lamb chops, his girlfriend had lamb curry, my wife had chicken tikka masala and I had Chana saag. All of the main dishes were aromatic and delicious. The only fault was that the vegetable pakora was over fried making it too crispy and the vegetables unrecognizable. We definitely will be back once we have recovered and not exhausted from moving."}
{"text":"First time trying Indian and it was okay. We tried the chicken tikka masala and it came with rice. The chicken in the masala was very tender. The naan (bread) was extra but the naan was really good.   Several dishes were left on our table and our drinks barely had ice and I had to ask twice before getting any ice. Server hardly checked on us but all the servers did come by and help if needed."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed with the buffet.  There were the usual suspects such as your obligatory tandoori chicken and some version of butter chicken.  What was missing were any items I really craved.  The biryani didn't excite me at all.  I had a great time with my cohorts because they are great dining partners, but the food itself was lackluster.  I would probably not go here again because there are so many excellent Indian buffets around.  The pricing here is a bit higher than some of my favorite buffets so you also have that making this a harder sell as a place to go.  The only counter is that in Concord I haven't been thrilled with the restaurants - you are close to North Charlotte and that is where you can get some real satisfying eats."}
{"text":"I went to Aroma over the weekend for their lunch and the food was good with the Indian flavors I tend to look for. So you're wondering why I'm giving this place 2 stars. It comes down to their sanitation! As I went to grab the chair to pull it out to sit down it had sticky residue on them. They were definitely not wiped down properly and that was nasty so I didn't even put my coat on the back of the chair, I stuffed it in my purse. Their glasses and silverware are worn down. The glasses had so much condensation built on them it made th water look murky. The spoons and forks are so bad it didn't feel right eating from them.  Also, the plates they racked up for customers were COLD. Every restaurant I've been to the plates have been hot as they come out of the washer but not these plates. Which makes me feel the plates weren't sanitary. Another issue was placing the Naan (Indian bread) outside the sneeze glass where everyone just walks past it and picking up with their hands....ewww. also, as I'm eating an employee comes around to mop around my table....REALLY? why would anyone mop as patrons are eating lunch and the employees were putting down a rug/runner at the same Time because the floor was slippery. I'm thinking what kind of horse and pony show is this? Now I have germs flying all over the food because they want to put down a rug on the floor. My last complaint is the bathroom was nasty as was the kitchen.  There is no sense of cleanliness at Aroma nor is there any etiquette as to what should be done prior to opening. Also the employees need uniforms.  Needless to say, I don't recommend this place and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very good and affordable lunch buffet. Butter chicken, chicken 65, and tandoori were phenomenal. The rose milk is a sweet treat and definitely the chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"I totally love this place... Especially the buffet... Beautifully done... So delicious... But never visit aroma on a Wednesday night... They supposedly have dosa night and its crowded like crazy... But I hate the way their service is on a Wednesday... Plus the dosas arent great..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go here to fulfill an Indian food craving after a shopping spree at Concord Mills Mall. The reviews were fantastic, and I already knew what I wanted. I got the Rava Masala Dosa and my boyfriend ordered Kadai Paneer. His food came first since Rava Dosa takes longer to cook and he graciously offered to share. Holy Moly that was the best kadai paneer I've ever had! My rava dosa arrived and it was really delicious too. Albeit a little too oily it tasted delicious! The potatoes were perfect and I loved the chutneys and sambhar. I, however couldn't finish my dosa so asked for a box and they gave me a whole container of fresh sambhar to go with my leftovers. I also tried the Madras coffee which was the closest thing to the one we get at udupi restaurants in India, along with Saravana Bhavan.  The owner was very sweet and attentive too, offering suggestions etc. I can't wait to go to Concord Mills again so I can indulge in the food at Aroma some more!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely solid. So why not give stars? Only because nothing really stood out as amazing. Want really good traditional northern and southern Indian and your near the outlets? This is your spot! Just a heads up, if you ask for hot, they serve it hot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING. The buffet selection is incredible. I have no idea what the names of all the dishes (tried a little of each) I tried but they were all delicious.   I have eaten Indian cuisine all over the world and this ranks as one of the best.   If your ever in the Charlotte area......Do check this restaurant out."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm surprised at some of the less than stellar reviews of this place because I was blown away by Aroma. They have a really intimate dining experience with low lighting, which I love. The staff was very friendly and even gave us free dessert.   I came with a group and we tried a lot of dishes off the menu and EVERYTHING was amazing. I have been searching for a great Indian restaurant in the Charlotte area and this is definitely the place! My favorite dish was the Chicken Tikka Masala! It melted in my mouth. The naan was so light and fluffy I could die. The best thing is that the prices are very reasonable! Plus the portions are very large!   I definitely plan on coming here again and bringing friends. Just a tip: Ur GPS might take u right past here to Adam and Eve, but it's right across the street from the custard place."}
{"text":"We had another great lunch at Aroma Indian Cuisine. The staff is all so friendly, especially Nikki with her warm and friendly smile. There is a wide variety of delicious foods, vegetarian and non, so many choices. The naan is the best, warm right out of the oven. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ate at Aroma for the lunch buffet today and everything was excellent, definitely the best Indian food I've had (although I have very limited experience with Indian food I must admit). The buffet was well-stocked with a variety of options, and everything was warm and fresh! The staff was nice and quickly took plates and refilled drinks every time I returned to sample some more from the buffet. I'm not an expert on Indian food, but everything I tried was at least decent with some choices that were excellent. My favorites from what I tried were the kodi vepudu, dal tadka, chicken curry, and their naan which was excellent. I would highly recommend trying the buffet for anyone who is looking to experiment with Indian food or who loves Indian cuisine because, especially for only $9, it can't be beat! I'll have to try some regular dishes off the menu now that I know how good the food is."}
{"text":"Picture it: nine hungry Yelpers after an Elite event up at the Speedway. Christi K fired up her Yelp app and found this little hidden gem. A solid 4.5 star Indian restaurant in Concord? We had to go check it out.   First things first: your GPS may take you to another little shopping center across the way where there is an Adam and Eve. Please note that Aroma is actually in the strip mall next to Friendly's. #TechnologyFail  Shout out to Tonya P for leading the ordering charge. She's my go to every time we hit up an Indian restaurant. Our order: channa bhatura, paper masla dosa, baby corn manchurian, regular naan, garlic naan, kashmiri naan, dal makhani, aloo gobi fry masala, butter chicken, chicken chettinadu, and some adult bevvies. I was the only one who wanted the baby corn. What can I say? I'm from Nebraska. I liked it and I think it was a surprise hit for the table. The shining star overall was the butter chicken. So damn good. Looks like I'll be finding reasons to drive up to Concord just so I can get this dish and some garlic naan.   Despite the large group, service was good and seamless. Our server was nice and helpful. He was able to keep checks separately flawlessly. He gave us all dessert. I can only describe it as a donute hoIe soaked in some kind of sweet syrup. 'll be back. Seriously, who wants to go get butter chicken right now?  One other random note: they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"The best Indian food restaurant I've come across in a long while! I love the Chicken Marsala... It's very flavorful and delicious. Also enjoy the Mint Naan bread... Typically order pick-up and the Husband approves of the food from this establishment, which means a lot since he's a legitimate Foodie!"}
{"text":"Indian food at its best. Chicken biryani was delicious, very tender.  Service was good. Weekend is very busy . Long wait, but it was worth waiting."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte.   Go to their buffet.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Indian food. But too often I find dishes that are tamed in spices or heat to accommodate the lighter palate of many Americans. This place does not fit that mold!   I decided to grab some take out and ordered chicken vindaloo, chicken masala and naan. The guy who took my phone order said the food would be ready in 45 minutes. What? Did I hear that correctly? I asked him to repeat It and again, he said 45 minutes. Yikes! I was hangry and wanted food much sooner so I asked if there's any way It could be expedited and he said ok, 30 minutes. *** sighs *** Guess I'll have to wait.   I get there in less than 20 minutes and figure I'd just wait around and maybe they'll speed It up if I ask really really really nicely. But not to worry, my food was done and waiting for me. Thank goodness!   I take my food home, the whole time smelling the delicious scent of spices through the bag, salivating at the lips.  I can't get home soon enough!   I take my first bite of the vindaloo and whoa - it is SPICY! I asked for very spicy cause that's how I roll and the dish did NOT disappoint! There were big chunks of chicken thighs which is much better than white meat which in my opinion, is too dry. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and absorbed all the delicious sauce. So good.  The chicken masala was even better. Now I'm usually a vindaloo kind of girl but the masala was so good, I think I may have converted. It was rich from the cream used but was not lacking the flavor punch expected from Indian cuisine. Again, large chunks of chicken thighs - you get your money's worth!   Before I left, I noticed there was a buffet but there weren't many options. Not sure if the lunch spread is any better but if the dishes I ordered was any indication, what they lack in buffet options, they must make up for in flavor. Cant wait to go back  and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Great Indian food!  The flavors were fresh, strong, aromatic, and exactly what you want when craving a good curry.  One of your best dinner choices in Concord."}
{"text":"Disappointed as there are limited vegetarian appetizers as compared to non vegetarian options...amazing gajar halwa though!"}
{"text":"We have been to Aroma several times now, and I wonder if either the ownership or chef have changed, because our latest experience wasn't the best.  During our first visit, we were in the mood for a vegetarian meal, and started with the Paneer Tikka.  It was served on a sizzling platter with cabbage, onions, and peppers, topped with six good-sized pieces.  The paneer had great flavor from the tikka sauce, although I also enjoyed dipping it in the mint chutney that is served with the papadum.  We have since had this dish again, and it was a bit less flavorful.  More sauce is definitely needed!  We've tried both the Rasam and Special Dal soups.  The Dal is our favorite, as it has a delightfully complex flavor.  This soup is also pretty spicy (I would say medium-to-hot), so be warned!  The Rasam is less flavorful, and is both spicier than the Dal soup and saltier.  We have not repeated that one.  For our entrees, we've had the Dal Makhani, Palak Paneer, Aroma Mixed Grill, and Butter Chicken.  Their Palak Paneer has a deliciously creamy sauce, and it is full of paneer chunks.  The Dal Makhani is a great complement to the paneer if you are in the mood for a vegetarian meal.  The Butter Chicken has both a nicely flavored sauce and moist chicken.  Their Mixed Grill is similarly moist.   My biggest complaint with their entrees is inconsistent seasoning.  We've asked for medium and spicy dishes, and we often get the same bland (i.e., non-spicy) meals.  This is even after we have assured the server we could take some heat.  I wish they'd apply similar heat to their entrees as their soups!  One of the most important parts of the meal is bread.  Here's where we've noticed a significant change.  On our earlier visits, the naan and roti were freshly made, warm, and really good.  On our last visit, both tasted like they had came from a package, and were barely heated.    I'm not sure we'll want to return after our last experience.  What a shame, since we really liked this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly and inviting. Service excellent. Food wonderful. Will definitely return. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not a good place to go if you want some appetizers. The biryani was okay. The staff was responding very slow. I had to taste the Apollo fish which was not at all fresh. I had a piece and returned it back. Didn't reimburse.   Biryani is decent."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of this place for buffet but disappointed, may be because of comparing with other buffet in US. Found silverware not clean and short of spoons. A place to visit once not often."}
{"text":"Came for lunch buffet and loved it. It's always a good sign when you go to an ethnic restaurant and your party is the only party that's not that ethnicity.  The moment you walk in the door the  wonderful aromatic scents transport you straight to India. They quoted us a 20 minute wait for our party of seven but then set us up and only a few minutes. The fabulous service continued from there. My favorite item on the buffet was the fish; it was crispy fried outside and moist inside. Curried goat, Masala and other Indian favorites were enjoyed by all."}
{"text":"I was impressed.  When I and a female companion were there, we were the only Anglos in the restaurant. I looked at this as a positive sign of authentic Indian food.  It was loud but it was typical of what one would expect of an Indian restaurant. My companion was more familiar with Indian food than I was. She ordered the lamb curry and said it was the best she had ever had.  She was impressed with the chunks of lamb in the curry.  I did taste it and it was good I will order it the next time I am in the area.  I have never had Indian food before. I had chicken tambourin, I cannot spell it but it was quite good.  All in all the food was quite good and I will go back. The service was great.  We had a well spoken waiter that came back 3-4 times to make sure our dinner was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Had to go up to Charlotte for a trade show.  I've heard about this place from an Indian friend of mine who said was very authentic.  So my friend and I headed up to Concord Mills.  When we arrived we were seated promptly seated.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and asked the chef if she was unsure of anything.  I ordered the Tandoori Mixed Grill and it was amazing!  I had several pieces of chicken, shrimp, and lamb.  And the chef even gave me a peanut sauce as well.  The owner came out and spoke with us as well.  And the naan, best I've ever had!  Overall, very good Indian restaurant. Kinda of the pricey side, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Food is very, very good.  The best Indian good in the area.  This restaurant just needs to work on the little details to be perfect.  Don't bang the silverware around while you put it away, teach the waiter how to pour ice water from a pitcher so that some ice goes in the glass.    Still, overall a great restaurant and not to be missed."}
{"text":"So good and so much variety!  The worst part is narrowing down our choices.  Great vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"Finally good Indian in Charlotte!  Loved the food! Amazing and deep menu. Good portion sizes, having again for lunch. Decent prices good value. Atmosphere nice too. Low lighting, not too loud. Took my 3y old and 3m old and was comfortable. Did \"team service\" and well done. Food came fast despite being pretty busy. Big fan, will go again despite being in the cluster F of concord mills (traffic)."}
{"text":"This restaurant's amazing aroma wafting out the front door pulls you right in and makes your tummy growl. We came here on a busy day at a busy time, but were seated quickly. There was a lunch buffet and that's what we all opted for. Buffet was popular and ran out of items quickly, but they were right there with refills quickly as well.  Butter chicken, tandoori chicken, tandoori fish, varieties of rice, and many other dishes were available. They also had rice pudding, strawberry and chocolate mousse for the sweet tooth. Fresh naan went fast, but was worth the wait. Hot and grilled perfectly. They also had wine available too. Service was quick to clear plates and refill water glasses. Everyone was able to choose what they wanted to eat and we all enjoyed the amazing flavors of the dishes."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Food is great and the waiters are always nice and helpful. They always come around checking on your meal, making sure your experience is positive. My family and I eat here several times a week, and always consistently great!"}
{"text":"I give this 5 stars because Indian Food is amazing.  I had the lunch buffet and it was better than most.  I will return for dinner! Great Service!"}
{"text":"Great food and pleasant service.  My daughter had never had Indian food and the staff was patient and helped her find just the right dish."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The staff recognized immediately we were a first time customer and were treated like royalty."}
{"text":"I'm near Concord Mills and all I can see around me are chains and fast food joints, both of which I attempt to avoid religiously. Let's be real chains served pre-fab food that is honestly disgusting and fast-food cost almost as much as a decent sit down joint. Then out of the corner of my eye tucked away in a strip mall I see Aroma Indian and suddenly I have to have some curry and julab jamoon!   Lucky for me they had an awesome lunch buffet going with a lot of options, so I didn't have to stress over what to order! The buffet was well stocked with lots of options ranging from sag paneer to Korma Chicken to Tandoori and biryani. Seriously impressed at the number of vegetarian options and chicken options. This place was packed I mean within 10 minutes of being in there I saw over 40 people come in and out.   The food was pretty good with great spices and flavor. I do wish they would have actually had some julep jamoon on the bar, sadly I had to settle for mango mouse for dessert (I know my life is rough). The service was impeccable: my water was filled constantly and the owner brought naan to the table when he noticed there was none on the bar when I got my plate.   If you are around Concord Mill's and you don't want to eat at another chain check this place out for an affordable lunch!"}
{"text":"Went here once and got take out for lunch. I got a yellow curry dish and hot and sour soup. Was not impressed. Considering going back to try the lunch buffet but I think that will only be when I run out of better options and there are so many in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was really bad, got there @ 730 didnt get water until 20mins later after askin several times just for water,  it was about 930 when we got the appetizer we had to reorder cause the first time it wasnt ordered, then waited for the entree's then the waitress came out n said that my food was taking a long time and asked me to order something else, they need 2 put on the menus may take up to 2hrs to cook so ppl wont order it, but they did say they were sry and that my meal was complimentary and the appetizer, it was our first time goin and very bad experience, wont go back! Left the restaurant @ 1015, they tried to redeem theirselves but it was too late."}
{"text":"Best weekend buffet in Charlotte. I really love their appetizers and goat curry. Keep it up Aroma! The only issue I have is their seating space and ambiance. I wish it was a little bigger and spacious."}
{"text":"I had the buffet here. I am extremely glad that there is one more good Indian restaurant with some good service and variety. I had the vegetarian side of the buffet, but I did see some meat eaters having a lot of fun! I ate everything which was vegetarian (everything.) The varieties were good, nothing was on the extremes. It was balanced. You should try it once, its not aha- or mind blowing, but it is just that fine balance of spices. I hope they maintain that standard."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the weekend lunch buffet here. The food was good and it was a decent spread. The staff was good and were quick to clear out our plates and refilling the water. The paneer butter masala and the chicken Manchurian were absolutely delicious.The only reason for going with three stars is that the desserts were a disappointment and the Idli was far too hard. Otherwise this place is good for a weekend lunch when you are too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Beware of the Boulder out front that rolled over my foot!!!   Women beware of hole in bathroom wall!!!    The hole in bathroom is sort of suspect!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. The Chicken briyani , Onion dosa with red chutney and Chicken tikka masala was both awesome to the taste and to look at. Also the service here was great and on par with the food and I just want to also thank the waitress who helped me and my family choose what to eat. I recommend this place to anyone seeking great food and service. The waitress gave awesome service to my family I will come again to this place"}
{"text":"Fantastic buffet with a good combination of meat and veggie dishes. The eggplant was some of the best I've ever tried. The kebab chicken and fish was very tasty. Chechen 65 was tender. And of course, Chicken Tikka Masala. The desserts were also varied and tasty. Very good deal and quite good."}
{"text":"Aroma is by far the best Indian restaurant and the only one around that makes many variations of dosa...great place!!!"}
{"text":"When nine Elite Yelpers decend on your restaurant, you're going to have a tough time. I think the strong scent of curry as we walked into Aroma had us convinced that the food was going to be on point.  The restaurant was able to put a table together for us on short notice which was super helpful and while it was a little crowded, it wasn't bad at all.  A curried baby corn appetizer was followed by curries, dosa, naan and more. Everyone really loved their meals and my Chicken Korma was excellent. A very good portion and nicely stocked with big pieces of white and dark meat chicken. Very flavorful and delicious. There was plenty of rice to go around. The garlic naan was also quite good in flavor, though I thought it was perhaps a little underdone.  Keeping it all organized and straight was tough. Four stars for a great restaurant, but maybe a better experience for a smaller party. I think they were a little strained getting nine of us taken care of together."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian buffet for lunch and very reasonably priced. This is one of the best Indian buffets I've been to in terms of taste and variety. There were a lot more choices than most restaurants and the flavors were great."}
{"text":"3 stars   I had to dock my rating on Aroma due to the lack of service this last visit. The biggest mistake of the night, there was no host/hostess. We waited at the door for what seemed like forever. The waiters even looked at us as they were walking by... Didn't even have someone seat us. I understand it's busy, at least have someone at the door to tell us we had to wait. That would have been better than getting ignored by servers passing by. We didn't get seated or greeted for 10 mins. (Docked a star) Didn't get water or our order taken for the next 15 mins after that. For some reason the water had this gross mildew like after taste that I just couldn't shake.. Bleh   We ordered the gobi manchurian appetizer like last time. The heat was good but the glaze wasn't as red it color. Would have liked some more onions but still was good and spicy. This is a dish they know how to make. The app came out 30 mins after the water.    We also ordered the hyderbadi chicken biriyani... Also very good in flavor and spice but it seemed like a significantly smaller portion than what we were served last time. This came out more than an hour after we were seated. Tasted great but still a little disappointed. My biggest issue here was I found eggshells in my biriyani! Not the most pleasant experience when eating biriyani. I didn't bother saying anything, it was already an hour past closing. (Docked a star)  Will come back, hopefully it was an busy, off day for them. We got here at 8:55p and didn't leave till 10:30p..."}
{"text":"Loved it! Best indian buffet in town. Food was fresh and very flavourful. Service was excellent . All i can say best indian food in town"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Charlotte I was looking for good Indian restaurant. I found Aroma Indian Cuisine, me and my friends all together we went for dinner we ordered 2 chicken biryani and 2 goat biryani food is too salty I informed them they took my plates and he bring it back again even this time also food is salty I never eat there we left from there."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place we love it so much that we finally decided to add a review. We have eaten in pretty much every indian restaurant in the charlotte/concord ares, Aromas is by far the best indian buffet . Great options fr veg , Fantastic desserts and wonderful service. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor with this Indian food.  Several versions of chicken curry for those that enjoy the  staple dish and they are all delicious. I recommend getting an order of naan bread to wipe up the remaining sauce - it's that good."}
{"text":"In town for a few days and wanted something very savory, very warm and very spicy. Thank you yelp for your reviews this place lived up to its good reviews. The food was excellent, I'm not very good with Indian food but the waiter was very good at helping me order (sorry, I can't remember what it was). It was so good and plenty in size. I had enough leftover to take back to my hotel."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine!! My boyfriend and I love the lamb and chicken vindaloo! Along with the cheese naan!! Absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"We loved Aroma tonight!  Had Tikka Masala saag Paneer and tried the Gobi Manchurian appetizer that was REALLY good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I had the butter chicken and it was amazing!!  The garlic naan was also wonderful!  This was definitely the best Indian food since moving to Charlotte. If you are at all close by stop in, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first time I ever ordered/tasted food from here. Although I wasn't happy with their service, I wanted to first taste their food before writing this review to be fair.  Service - Really bad. I liked their honesty when they said it will take 45 minutes to prepare 5 dishes that I ordered (Spicy Chicken Fried Rice, Spicy Chicken Biryani, Medium spicy goat biryani, chili chicken and Ginger chicken). However the service turned bad as soon as we reached the restaurant to pick up the food 55 minutes after we had ordered and had to wait in the restaurant for another 15 minutes before we could get the food. They literally took an hour and 10 minutes to prepare 5 dishes.  Coming to the food - the appetizers (Chilli chicken and Ginger chicken) tasted absolutely delicious and right to the point. Disappointment started rising when it came to the main course though. The spicy chicken biryani had no spice whatsoever and mostly had no taste with burnt chicken pieces. The spicy chicken fried rice could have been delicious if it was a normal fried rice rather than a pepper fried rice. The pepper was just too much and too overpowering. I wish they had used green chilies or crushed red pepper to make it spicy. To end with a positive note, the goat biryani was above average with delicious and tender pieces.   The reason for just 3 stars would be because of bad service and 2 bad main courses to be fair.  To conclude - In my opinion, this is a good restaurant for appetizers but they need some improvement with the main courses."}
{"text":"I had mimosa potato dumplings, chicken masala, garlic naan and one king fisher beer.  Food was served perfectly med spicy, just as I ordered.  The food temperatures were very hot, nothing worse than your food being just warm...then it is cold when you get to the bottom of the bowl!   Great wait staff...great taste and full belly!"}
{"text":"My wife and I drove to Concord Mills from Hickory and wanted to try something new.  Neither of us are Indian food experts so we asked our server Ashwin for some recommendations. He took the time to ask us a few questions about what we liked before suggesting Chicken Tikka Massala and Lamb Roganjosh.  We enjoyed both and look forward to coming again the next time we are in the area."}
