{"text":"Let me start out by saying the location on the map is a little bit off.  The address is listed as 200 Woodlawn Rd, but that should be 200 W Woodlawn Rd.  The pointer on the map shows 200 E Woodlawn Rd.  This tiny restaurant is tucked in a strip mall that sits behind the IHOP and beside the Ramada Inn.

I went to lunch here today with high hopes, based on the reviews I read here and on other sites.  The results were mixed.  I had the jerk chicken with fried plantains and mac & cheese.  A friend had ox tail with the same side.  We both had lime tea to drink.  The tea, it turns out, was Nestea with a splash of lime juice.  I haven't been to Jamaica, so maybe that is authentic.

My friend's food came first, and she immediately commented that the mac & cheese was straight out of the box.  She was right--Velveeta Shells & Cheese all the way.  At this point I was getting worried.  My plate came out a few minutes later, and with the first bite of jerk chicken, the kitchen bounced back.  It was fall-off-the-bone tender and juicy.  And the flavor packed a punch.  The plantains were good--it's hard to go wrong there.  And my friend gave the ox tail a big thumbs up.

Overall, Island Paradise was a good choice.  The sides stumbled, but the main dishes made up for it.  I won't go back tomorrow, but I will go back."}

{"text":"I'm in Love with the jerk chicken, mac and cheese, and cabbage!!! Awsome flavors all on the same plate! I've been here a few times and the name has changed. It was Island Paradise and it's now Caribbean Hut. You have to try the jerk chicken it's mandatory!"}
{"text":"Just food alone--  5 star

Place is old and dumpy and the service is average.  Location sucks

So I gave it a 3 star.  FOOD IS VERY GOOD."}
{"text":"The food is soooo good, the service not so much. They need to hire some help. I got the curry chicken,  plantains, coco bread and a beef patty. I had plenty left for lunch the next day. Try the lime tea!"}
{"text":"My co-worker recommended this restaurant to me but warned me that the customer service was not the best. Well that was definitely  an under statement to say the least. My friend and I arrived about 6pm on Friday night, there were two other people in the restaurant. We waited about .5 hr for service before I got up and went to the bar to place my order, only to be told to go and sit at a table and wait for a waitress to come and take my order. We should have ran out the door right then there. Well, the waitrees finally comes over and was pleasantly polite. I ordered the chicken patties and the stew  chicken and my friend orders a beef patti and a combo meal of jerk and stew chicken. Both Patties were cold when they arrived to the table (ugggg) but had good flavor so we continued to nibble. Finally our food comes out and it was not the Jamaican style food that we were expecting. My friend and I picked around our food and chatted for about another .5hr. Mind you, noone ever came back to our table to check on us, I get it though, after sitting there for a while ,we noticed that most customers come in to order and take food out. My friend walks to the counter to ask for our check and before she could get the words out of her mouth, the owner blurts out ,IT'S GOING TO BE .5 HR MAAM. my friend replied, for what , my check. The owner , feeling a little silly, calls for the waitress that took our to prepare our checks. Well it took 10 or15 minutes before we finally received our checks. Unbelievable. The customer service here is the wrost I have experienced in all my dinning experiences and I will never visit this restaurant again  nor recommend to anyone that I know."}
{"text":"Just the change of pace needed at lunch time. I had a spicy beef patty and stewed chicken with cabbage and rice and beans. Quick friendly service, piping hot well seasoned food."}
{"text":"There is no better place for Caribbean food in Charlotte.  Great food, prices and people."}
{"text":"Good authentic flavors! But watch out for bones. I had the Goat curry and really enjoyed it! I also tried the jerk chicken -  good flavors!"}
{"text":"My first and last time here. There was only one server, who seemed to have an attitude because of it. There was a large party seated in one of the cubbyhole dining areas, two couples waiting on food and one finishing up. The server barely greeted anyone and had an attitude when speaking to some of the customers. 
I ordered the curry and jerk chicken combo with cabbage, peas and rice, and plantains. The cabbage was more like a slaw with green peas, carrots, corn and a mustard like dressing. The jerk chicken was more like blackened chicken off the grill and did not have any jerk sauce or seasoning. The curry chicken was salty and curried more for the color than taste. 
I was disappointed since I've been wanting a Jamaican spot near my house.  The lack of customer service and poorly flavored food make it difficult for me to support this place."}
{"text":"The chef here has is better than average. I ordered the steamed Red Snapper.  Excellently prepared!  Rice and peas is a bit bland. Also had a side of Jerk Chicken as an appetizer: best I had in Charlotte. 

My side of plantains was made fresh-to-order. Delicious! I will have to come back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here...unfortunately, it was also my last.  The service was a little slow and the order was not correct; however, that was not the issue. I will admit that the food was good, BUT I immediately lost my appetite when I saw a roach crawling across the floor! To make matters worse, they tried to charge me and my coworker for a large plate when we both ordered the lunch portion. Disgusted is an understatement!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Everyone has to give it a try. We ordered the jerk chicken and curry chicken and it was delicious. I told the waitress that I will go back again. Their Jamaican sodas, beef and chicken patties are very delicious. The service is very friendly and great music."}
{"text":"Nested inside the seediest parking lot/strip mall I've ever been in is this little place which makes mad decent food. We got it to go because we were going to tailgate on the other side of the parking lot (ACC championship) and it was quick and hot and yummy. BBQ jerk chicken plate, plantains, meat pies, bread. All good! One of the more intriguing eating options within reasonable walking distance."}
{"text":"I believe the name is now Caribbean Hut.  We had the jerk chicken and the oxtail and both were outstanding!  If you're in a hurry, this is not the place for you.  We were there for lunch and there were 5 other diners already served and 2 people waiting for carryout orders.  It took 15 minutes for our order to be taken, another 15 for the food to come and we had to go to the bar to get our check.  very inattentive staff!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from NY...   I would say the rice was just 'ok' but the oxtails and curry chicken made up for it.  The service was somewhat slow and you must step up to the plate to get things moving.  I tried other Jamaican restaurants on the other side of Charlotte by University, one of which was pretty good called Carib hut..  However the portions you get here is actually reasonable compared to others.  Overall a good place."}
{"text":"love the food here, you don't come here for the decor. Call ahead and order what you need and be on your way is the best experience"}
{"text":"A must try. A little high for a lunch special ($11 for curry goat). But they offer plenty of food and it taste amazing."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that was really good because I miss the place I always went to in Philly. We order take out. I had the curry goat and oxtails with mac n cheese, rice and beans it was really good. im trying to go back today."}
{"text":"Ya mon'. 

Sorry, I couldn't resist. So the location might appear a lil' shady or eclectic, depending on your perception. It's nestled in a little strip mall near some empty suites, Club Kiss, Red Door and some kinda ahem, 'gentlemans' club. My kinda place? Eh, who cares, the food's good.

So I've been a long time fan of Carribean food and Jamaican curry has always been one of my faves. Jerk Chicken is great when it's done right and I think Island Paradise does it right. Nicely spiced, both spiced and spicy, chopped up with a big cleaver (bones and all), and piled right on top of rice and beans, cabbage, plantains or even mac n cheese (huh). Yum."}
