{"text":"Best in new ken Arnold area hands down don't waste your time else where made love goes into these pies:-)"}
{"text":"New to the area and have been on the hunt for good pizza. Rosa's is now at the top of the list. Loved the sauce and thin crust...not to mention they don't pile on 50 pounds of cheese like so many other places."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in the entire world, and it has been ever since I can remember.  The cheese is garlicky, the sauce is tangy, and the crust is medium/thin.  I like to order my pizza plain, well done, with extra sauce, but their toppings are also delicious!  I do wish that they delivered, but that is my only complaint."}
{"text":"This is an old school shop-absolutely no bells and whistles, but who needs them when you've got such an delicious pizza to dig into?  The crust is neither too thin nor too thick and has a nice bite to it.  The sauce has a hint of sweetness that balances perfectly with the crust, cheese and other toppings.  Walking into the tiny shop, you're hit with a sensory whammy- the scents of yeast, tomatoes and cheese baking into a pie, the warmth of the oven, the phone ringing with take out orders, bodies crowding against one another as we await our turn to carry out the box that we're taking home for dinner.  I've never tried any of Rosa's bakery items, so can't speak to those, but if what you're looking for is just an authentic, unpretentious pizza, this is your place."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in the region. By far. Better than fiores, vinny pie, mineos and all the rest. Service is awful and they dont even answer the phone half the time but it just adds to the mystique."}
{"text":"If you're from New Kensington, you know about Rosa's. The best pizza in Pittsburgh and it isn't close. Limited selection of hoagies, but the pizza is worth the trip. Everything is homemade and the owner and her daughter are very kind and engaging. Highly recommend this gem in New Kensington!"}
{"text":"This pizza was not very good at all. Kind of surprised to see the rave reviews about this place on here, we did not care for it at all. The pizza is very different, it's thin and the crust has a strange texture to me."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite.  I love thin crust Pizza and this is the BEST!  Their baked goodies are also delicious!  Haven't had the hoagies but hear they are good too!!"}
{"text":"Great little ma and pa pizza joint.  There sauce is just wonderfull not to tangy not to sweet just the perfect balance!  The crust seems a little processed but still very good pie and def one of the better pizzas I've had.  Sit down area for 6-8 people but very small.  You all have to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Best New York style pizza in New Ken area....family owned and operated. Great sauce and cheese. Won't find a bad thing on the menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a family-owned and operated business, this is the one! They've been around for over 50 years and there's a reason. The pizza is great and it feels like every time I stop in, they add more things to the menu...BBQ Pulled Pork Pizza? Yes, please! The homemade desserts and cookies are incredible. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This pizza is by far my favorite pizza around the new Kensington area. Although it's a little pricey the quality is worth it. The hoagies are also delicious."}
{"text":"No pizza near here can even get close to being as good as Rosa's. It's the embodiment of a neighborhood pizza shop that only most can dream about. Fresh ingredients, friendly staff and personalized pizzas. I only hope that the owner passes her recipe on to her children and that they're willing to put in the hard work and attention that she does. Not one other pizza shop in the valley - NOT ONE - can compare to Rosa's. Best ever!"}
{"text":"Classic old school pizzas shop. This type of authenticity is extremely rare these days.    I've been eating at Rosa's since the early 80s and it as good as it's always been.  Great place.  Great people.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Rosa rosa rosa  I actually think I met Rosa when I stopped yesterday to pick up a large thin crust pizza on my way home from work. It honestly wasn't that good, the crust tasted processed and it could have been bigger  There just wasn't much special about it     But let me say this when I looked into your eyes Rosa I saw something....there is great pizza inside you Rosa I know it and you know it. Now it's time you let that pizza come out your business depends on it"}
