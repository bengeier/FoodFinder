{"text":"Outstanding service, great delicious food. Very friendly crew! Hours of operation are very convenient too."}
{"text":"I went to buy fish from them. The worker / chef was extremely rude. When I told the owner about his rude behavior, the chef became confrontational, stopped cleaning the fish and handed me a half-cleaned fish. Never going back again."}
{"text":"It was amazing. The chef and the waiter are very personable and the meal was excellent. I had the black bass with brown rice and veggies. The fish tasted very fresh and I am normally not a fan of brown rice but the chef convinced me to try it and I am quite grateful. I also had dessert which was cheesecake that was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time because my friend told me how good it was. And it was ! They had fresh fish and jumbo shrimp for a good price. The inside is really nice and clean. Very new ! The owner is very nice and the chef came over and talked to us he was also very nice. I got the fried calamari at it was very good. I mixed lemon with a yogurt based sauce they had and then got the jumbo shrimp same with my friend as our dinner came with a salad and brown rice which the brown rice was very good ! And the shrimp of course, my friend agreed too. My other friend got the stripped bass and said it was amazing and very meaty. We were stuffed afterwards. We will be back !"}
