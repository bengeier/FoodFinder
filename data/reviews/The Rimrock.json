{"text":"I attended the breakfast buffet at 7:30AM with a few office teammates and was blown away by the experience.   The restaurant itself matches the style of the Fairmont Palliser in opulence and open design, lending itself well to having a conversation, and the staff were very friendly and attentive - especially noteworthy given the hour we were dining!  The buffet selection was diverse and included such staples as eggs benedict, waffles, and omelettes, in addition to a great selection of pastries and fruit.   Overall the experience was memorable and I wouldn't hesitate to visit again or recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Way too overpriced for what you get. My girlfriend and I had the valentines tasting menu with the wine pairing ($450 for two). Food was lackluster, and the wines did not compliment the dishes. Service was slow and spotty, and we felt like we were being rushed out the door as we were one of the last reservations of the evening. They even started cleaning around us and setting up the buffet for the next morning. Definitely not a fine dining experience. It was our first, and last time dining at the Rimrock. Spend less money and get a better meal at some other downtown Calgary restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to the Rimrock before the theater on Saturday.  It was OK.  Entrees were expensive compared to other restaurants in this class.  My New York strip steak wasn't as tender as I would have liked and not the same quality as Ruth's or Caesar's.  Our friends had the lamb shank which was a much better choice.  It had clearly been cooking all day and was very tender.  The wine we ordered was out of stock so we were treated to an exceptional upgrade at the same cost.  I was quite happy with our server although my wife, Jamie F, thought the service was slow.  I'm more inclined to give demerits for speedy service as I don't like to be rushed.  Overall I'm ambivalent about the Rimrock for dinner."}
{"text":"Nice fancy restauant in the classy palliser hotel downtown.  Went Friday May 13th with the gf.  Wasn't busy at all at 7pm.   Nice, old, comfy room.    Ordered a $45 Spring creek ribeye (one of the cheapest steaks on the menu).  Sides were great.  Steak was cooked perfectly.  Specialty drinks were expensive - but got my gf tipsy, lol.  Expensive place.  A few tables were celebrating special occasions.  I would probably go to Ruths Chris next time."}
{"text":"Really nice little bar/restaurant in the Fairmont Palliser.  Very fair prices, nice selection and great service.  I was pretty impressed with this place all around."}
{"text":"Delicious quiet haven,  GF options and micro diet options.   Breakfast is costly and delicious with 5 star service and high quality food.  Wouldn't expect anything less from the Fairmont family. I would go back anytime."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner at the Rimrock while staying at the Fairmont Palliser. Simon, our waiter was super efficient, friendly and helpful. The prime rib was excellent and he made sure to get the type of cut perfect for both of us. Bravo!"}
{"text":"We had booked a group of 15 girls for a bachelorette party at 6 on a saturday. It was 1920's theme and thought the décor would be perfect. Everything was scheduled ahead of time and a 3 course meal was planned and pre-arranged weeks in advance. We arrived and were seated in the far corner of the restaurant at a long table. The place is beautiful of course. We were expecting a fine dining and fancy experience. After we arrived our server came by to fill water for everyone. When talking with here she said this was only her 4th shift there so the rest of the night we place no blame on her part. She took drink orders, most of us sharing bottles of wine, a few getting cocktails. We were there for 45 mins before any of us got our drinks and some bread. Then it was another half hour to get our salad. It was a good salad with kale and watermelon. We then waited another 45mins or so for our entrée of roasted chicken. At that time we were all starving having come with empty stomachs and waiting so long to get food. The chicken breast was dry and tough. I was not impressed at all and since being so starving was very unhappy about this. Then we waited another 30-45mins for our dessert of crème brulee. It was good but nothing above what I've had at less fancy places. In the end It worked out to about $80 per person with the 18% gratuity for our large group. I understand that managing large tables is very difficult and things can take longer to cook. But this was planned months in advance and a pre-set menu so why the courses were so far apart was difficult to understand as everything should have been prepared. Our poor waitress also had little help. When bringing out plates of food she was doing it all herself and obviously only able to carry 3 plates at a time. It was frustrating to watch this and we wondered why she was not getting help with running orders and clearing plates? especially because she was so new. The place was never busy with only a few tables at a time apart from ours. For a place like this I expected more surperior service and especially food. It was definitely not worth the price. I orderd 1 cocktail the whole evening and that alone with the added gratuity cost $20!  I definitely do not recommend this place for a large group of any kind. Very disappointed and killed the energy of our celebrations."}
{"text":"It was ok... I went there for lunch with a large group and we had the 3 courses special lunch... I started with the salad and it was good; my main dish was the salmon and I really liked it... The dessert was ok. The best thing for me was the coffee at the end.. It was really good!!.. And the service was not bad..."}
{"text":"BEST SERVICE EVER & FOOD IS JUST AS AMAZING!  I've been to all kinds of restaurants in Calgary from $ to $$$$ and I've been trying out high end restaurants with my family for the past few months so we decided to have lunch here on a Tuesday afternoon. I looked at the menu online and was very pleased and excited to try out the food.  When I first entered the hotel, it looked really fancy (just like the fancy hotels in Vegas). We got seated and was served by the most amazing server ever, I believe his name is Jack. He took care of us and went out of his way to deliver great service and this is also the reason why I decided to make a Yelp account and write a review. Actually, all the servers here were extremely awesome, but Jack was our main person who helped us and he was just beyond incredible.  The food was excellent. I have tried all kinds of calamari in other restaurants, but this one is just something I can eat everyday. The main course was just as good, the salmon was soft and delicious. I also had a creme brulee for dessert, and I thought it would be a little small, because they normally are... but this one is huge and really good.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went for Afternoon Tea today with my mom, and it was really cute.  Service was amazing right from the start - We had reservations for 1:30pm, but we were a little early - no problem, we were seated right away.  Our server (Julie?! I think?) brought a tray of little jars of loose tea over and described each one to us, then left the tray with us so we could smell them & decide which one we wanted. I chose an herbal apple (so good) and my mom chose the Palliser house blend. (she loved it, but i had a sip and it wasn't my cup of tea.)(get it?!) first we were served a fruit cup with grand marnier whipped cream. delicious. Then the Tower of Power came out, and wow! Three layers of treats, (2 pieces of each so we each got one) starting with vanilla scones, cottled cream, apricot jelly, and Saskatoon berry jelly.  Second layer on the tower was tiny little sandwiches - a salmon one, a cucumber one, and a curried chicken salad one. Nothing amazing taste wise, but man were they cute! Oh, and deviled eggs, which were awesome.  Third layer was the desserts, a couple macarons, a cake with gold flakes on the top, a little berry tart, and a delicious green tea cream puff thing. All pretty good!  The ambiance was great, and I'd love to go for more Afternoon Teas, but unfortunately for me it was a bit pricey ($99 including tip, no booze or anything) but I totally understand that all that stuff is fancy and etc and that's why it's so expensive!  Really fun anyways, and a nice way to spend an afternoon with mom!"}
