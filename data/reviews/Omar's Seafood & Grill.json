{"text":"I was introduced to Omar's by my brother about year or 2 ago.....its amazing how little gems in your city are sitting right in your face and you'll never know.....I am in love with this place....Omar and Kay are awesome and I definitely highly recommend their Perch, Shrimp, and Scampi....since I'm not big on potatoes I opt for double cole slaw....situated and tucked away at the corner of St. Clair and Shaw you will not be disappointed.....so give em a try and tell em Tawana sent ya!"}
{"text":"I've been to Omar's many times over the years.  I think their one pound shrimp dinner with side for $8.99 is the best deal in town.  The food is always consistent.  Fresh, good food quality and well prepared.  The interior is a little retro funky.  I think it adds charm.  Consider Omar's carryout only since there really isn't a dining room.  Debit or Cash Only.  Great value.  Great food.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Omars is the best if u want some good seafood come to omars a little pricey but its so worth it"}
{"text":"Omar's is another Laid back hole in the wall that does just what it's supposed to, which is serve good food. I really like this place and the great deals. Don't expect to sit down and eat, it is a get and go kind of place"}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and the food was delicious. I ordered the Catfish dinner and a Shrimp dinner. Both were perfectly prepared and seasoned. I was pleasantly surprised to find both the cocktail sauce and the tarter sauce were homemade. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and good price. Definitely a good place to visit and that I will come back if I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Omar's has some of the best fried fish you could ever eat, including your homemade fish! It's always cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside but flaky on the inside. I've had their scampi's and they were good, also had the spaghetti which I wasn't really a fan of but the fish is BOMB!! The employees are always nice and there's a lady that works up front that's super funny and keeps your entertained while you wait on your food. Love going here!"}
{"text":"Customer service, quality/quantity of food,price and wait time always top notch."}
{"text":"I need Omar's to add some seasonings on those scampies they serving up. #garlic #oldbay #seafoodseasonings"}
{"text":"Omar's is the truth.  Love the scampi and wings.  They need to bottle their BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Terrible...ordered catfish tasted like Talipia, which I don't eat, and how do scrampies that are supposed to be cooked to order are soft and mushy."}
{"text":"This is a carry out restaurant off of St. Clair.  If you know what you want, I recommend you call ahead to order.  As far as I can tell, most of the menu is made to order and not pre-made so you'll have to wait.  I ALWAYS order the $9.99 scampi special so I can't rate the other dishes, but the scampi dinner is served with fries and coleslaw.  When I order, I ask they substitute the coleslaw with fries and they are always happy to oblige.  The scampies are buttery, delicious, and a decent size.  The dinner comes with about 5 I think.    Some of the other menu items are polish boys, whiting, perch, orange roughy, cheese steak sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ive been eating here about 12 years or more first thing Omar and his wife are great people . Ive never had a problem with my food except once my fish was overcooked but they discounted my next meal great place for Walleye, red snapper , Whiting ,Perch lobster tail etc. The Scampi dinner is off the chain I recomend. He has a couple of tables in there if you need to eat there but its mostly a carryout ."}
