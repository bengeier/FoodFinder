{"text":"We eat here at least once a week. The food is excellent and they have good prices on beer too. The waitresses are very friendly and always interact with my daughter. Hard to find a better place to go."}
{"text":"Great service, don't think I sat in my seat longer then 20 seconds before I was asked what can I get you. Great food!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with a lot of room in and out. Fine ladies as waitstaff. Usually a food or beer special, Thursday Bike Night,$1/beer"}
{"text":"Wish I could have given zero stars but since the bartender was prompt with the menu and with my beer.....I guess 1 star is warranted.

After getting my beer....sat for 20 minutes opening...staring....and closing the menu.  When bartender was able to finally come back to get my order.....I'd had enough.  I paid for my beer and left.

Never had any trouble at any of the Iron Thunder Saloons before but I doubt I will make any effort to go to I.T.S again.

I travel 50 weeks a year and I enjoy good food, good beer and if possible....good conversation but I think I can get this from somewhere else.  

At least my beer was decent."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible service!!! We went in and sat down for twenty minutes. The place wasn't even that crowded. Nobody ever even came up to our table. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Looking over my credit card statement, I see they charged me more than I signed for. Guess I didn't leave a big enough tip."}
{"text":"nice place...it is what it is a sport/biker theme bar/restaurant.. and it doesn't strive to be anything else...that's why I like it.  My wife and I go every week or so for the wings, which are consistently good; my favorite the cajun, wife likes the honey habenero.  Nightly beer specials, etc.  Looking for a challenge, try the buffalo chicken sandwich.  It's huge, I'm a big boy, big appetite, and I can't usually finish it.  As for the servers outfits (they have themes every night...) sure they're \"skimpy\" and reveling, but nothing you've never seen at the beach, or the mall for that matter.  If you are easily offended, don't bring the kiddies.  Bottom line, I like the place and my friends do also."}
{"text":"Good for for a bar and great service.  We came in from Pittsburgh and were pleasantly surprised..."}
{"text":"Food was good. Drinks were good as well. Service was prompt and the ladies were lovely . The live band on Saturday nights is way, WAY too loud. The volume is high enough for a venue 5x the size of this place for maybe 30 people. Couldn't even hear the poor waitress. Should pay extra for lip reading. 

Good for late night food though."}
{"text":"If your not a local dont come here.  From wgat I could see if the bartender or waitress new you they would hang out and talk to you, but we were new to the area and the bar looked interesting. 
To start the night we sat outside. Asked that the tv channel be changed. Waitress said ok we'll see if we can get that changed.  After an additional 3 times asking she doesn say they can change the channel she says the bartender has been \" backed up\". I go inside and the bartender is  talking to the ame group she had been talking to for a while. Later we went in to watch the fight which was on the tvs inside.  I ordered a drink and the bartender told me she was going to make it on the other end of the bar. Expecting me to move to the other end to get it.  Just a sub par place. Has a lot of potential but not going to draw in any new businesses with this type of service."}
{"text":"Has had the \"N\" word etched in the men's room for about a year now, appears if someone has made a flaccid attempt at covering it... Un sat."}
{"text":"Service FUÂ€%ING SUCKS. To the owner fixer your retarded bar tender. I literally had to set my beer bottle sideways so she could understand that it was empty. Later, I asked for my check and she started counting her penny tips at the register and I swear I did nothing to make her angry. Do not waist your money here unless you want to look at an empty beer bottle more than you want to look at a full beer bottle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."}
{"text":"A few of us went here on Tuesday night to check things out. We had heard Ok things about the place and decided it couldn't be too bad. 
When you arrive, there is a hostess stand but it wasn't being used. We stood around for about 5 minutes and was finally told, to sit wherever we wanted - we searched for a clean table for four and eventually one was 'cleaned' for us. 
The drink specials, 1.50 PBR and 2.00 High Life made me laugh. They had 10cent peel-n-eat shrimp also. We ordered a round and some shrimp as well as nachos. The nachos were inedible, soaked with sour cream and some sort of chili. 

We were here about 2 hours, not because we wanted to be, but it took that long to get our drinks, food, and pay. 

ps - the wait staff attire can be intriguing."}
{"text":"Do not come here, especially if you are a female! Both bartenders looked over at me but ignored me for 5 minutes then one of them came over and took my order but never came back. The other bartender finally came over and took my order and also never came back. I finally walked out. Twin Peaks was much better!"}
{"text":"if you can get passed all the girls in short skirts and big boobs !!!!
the hamburger and buffalo chicken sandwich are good. but you can sit there all day and they won't buy you one drink. ;("}
{"text":"From a general standpoint, the business is very comparable to a Hooters. If you're a guy, you'd probably enjoy the scenery for obvious reasons. As per my first trial run, I quickly began to develop the ideal that the business is a hole-in-the-wall biker hangout, which for me, also has its appeal. Unfortunately, it has a service attitude that parallels such. The service is very below par. Even with some only serving 1-3 tables, servers still manage to delay and/ or screw up orders. This includes soft drinks or alcohol AND has occurred every time, out of four trips out there.

As far as the food is concerned, I haven't had a complaint yet. Decent menu for the given atmosphere. They have a chicken sandwich there that I always need a box for and can literally use for one, or sometimes two additional meals. Yes, the chicken is like a whole chicken in a giant bun. The bun does not do this breast justice. It is huge! 

If you are looking for a nice low key hang out where you can get together with a few buds and shoot some pool (4, 9ft tables here in a separate room), have a few beers, and have time to wait for food to go along with that beer, this place can be ok.
 
-Do not go at lunch (especially if you only have an hour break).
 
-Place order at bar."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Although the service was pretty good the food is nowhere near what it was just 3 years ago. The owners and managers must not eat there.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Nothing big here! Good food! Typical service, not overwhelmed at all! The  food with a slightly hefty price was more waffle housy to me"}
{"text":"The beer is cold.  The service is kind of cold as well.  I was here for .15 peel and eat shrimp Tuesday.  Not a lot people while is was here.  Took a while for the waitress to stop talking a group of guys and ask if I wanted a drink...took even longer for her to give me a menu or acknowledge the fact that I might want to eat.

All in all, the food was decent, the beer is cold and the waitresses (while not very attentive to a single patron) were decent to look at in their PJs or whatever you call 'em."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is good enough for me. It's bar food.   The beer is cheap and the girls are gorgeous. Mindy is an awesome bartender/waitress and there's one other girl. A shorter blonde who is also really good.  I enjoy going here after work to grab a beer or grab a few with a buddy. Can't beat the $2 16oz Busch lights and    $.44 wings on Mondays!  Oh! And they clean everywhere here. Was here on a dead night and they had everything apart cleaning all over.  I really enjoy knowing where k eat is clean."}
{"text":"Come hungry for a pleasant stop near Concord Mills

We were out today helping my Stepson and his wife pick up some patio furniture and go get some things for our upcoming trip to Marietta Ga for a some to be 3 year olds birthday when lunchtime rolled around.

We had eaten at Iron Thunder years ago but had not been back lately. That is not to say we have not dined at one of their sister locations in Mooresville. Same menu for Concord, Mooresville and also Hickory.

It a bit spartan when you walk in with most of the tables being hightops around the edge of the room. Still like most sports bars, plenty of big screen TV's around the room and for a change, this was the first Sports Bar I've been to that had competition Rodeo on.

We were promptly seated and the normal sequence of presentation of menu and taking beverage orders followed returning with the beverages and taking our lunch order in a very timely fashion.

My wife ordered the Crab Balls  appetizer and the Soup of the Day which was a Brandied Onion Mushroom soup in lieu of a full entree.  I ordered the Buffalo Chichen Sandwich with Fries as a side. I had that at Mooresvillle and had enjoyed it there so tried it again.

My wife liked her meal and commented that the Soup and a nice taste and texture to it.

As far my Sandwich, first of all I could not believe the size of the thing. Looking at it, I expected it to be very dry because of the crust on the outside but just beneath the crust was a very flavorful bird cooked just right. Hats off to the kitchen staff although i will point out the fries were a bit under cooked and needed more time in the fryer.

I was a good lunch and I would recommend it as a different place to have a nice lunch in the Concord Mills area. It's next door to the Harley Davidson shop which is probably part of the origin of the name for the restaurant.  This is the oldest of the three restaurants and the one  in Hickory is also next to a motorcycle dealer."}
{"text":"Very nice folks work here. Especially Mindy and Craig. Great to service our party on a regular basis. They are really great staff because our tab can get confusing and they handle it well. They have daily specials on the menu which are good. The Rueben is good too. Fun little place for watching sports, karaoke, or shooting a game of pool."}
{"text":"Anyone out in Yelp world know why I cannot check in at this establishment?  Very frustrating, but from this location, I can check into Quaker Steak and Lube?????  errrrr....

Anyways, my wife and I visit about every Wednesday night for bike night.  The wings are awesome and my wife says they have the best quesadillas.  Also, if you wanna try something different, get the Buffalo Chicken breast sandwich, the breast is big as hell.  I mix buffalo sauce and terriyaki for something different.  The bleu cheese dressing is friggin' awesome.  Not that running crap Quaker has......

My only bitch is, make sure you ask them to send out some fresh fries, seems like the fries are cold if I do not ask for a new drop......

There is usually 10-25 bikes, good crowd and they always have a great band.  Sometimes the band sets up on the patio.  

Recently, Speedway Harley started have their Wed bike night, so you can walk back and forth.  About 50-100 bikes up at Pat's.  It is gonna be interesting when Suk Bang Blow opens in the next parking lot!!!!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out for dinner during race weeks. It was alllright. Ordered the \"thunder thighs\" - which sounded like buffalo wings made w chicken thighs, but ended up w regular wings. Not sure if we got the wrong order or if they are just called thighs when they are wings. Either way I was disappointed, but the wings were pretty decent after I got over the sadness.

At our table we had a chicken sandwich, a sausage and pepper hoagie, and a pork chop. The chicken was reported as good (wasn't mine), the pork was Ok but not out of this world, and the sausage was messy but good - had marinara sauce on it which was unexpected. The mac and cheese was a little greasy but pretty good.

As for the \"biker bar\" label.. I saw about 2 bikers and the rest of the crowd was regular peeps. The girls wear skimpy outfits so its not a family place for sure. 

It was ok, but I'm not dying to go back right away."}
{"text":"Blonde Bartender was obnoxious and rude. She went as far as biting my arm which left teeth marks; not only is this extremely unprofessional no matter the circumstance, but disgusting and immature. I'd say management doesn't find an issue with this which is why their * rating has to be inflated...."}
{"text":"Good was decent. However it took a while to get some service. Also it was more expensive to get cheese fries then it was to get loaded cheese fries. I don't know why"}
{"text":"This review is based on the restaurant portion of Iron Thunder, not the bar. I don't drink and neither does my husband, but we do enjoy a good meal regardless of the setting.

The place is loud and is definitely geared towards a male clientele. The servers are all attractive women showing off their assets in a Hooters-type of way. With that said, they've all been very professional and do an excellent job. As a female, I don't feel like I'm treated any less attentively than my husband. 

The food is excellent! Any and all of it. Try the chicken wings...you will not be disappointed. There are many sauces to choose from, my favorite is the Parmesan sauce. The fried oysters are large and really good. We've tried all sorts of sandwiches, pasta and steak there. All have been delicious and worth the price.

They run different specials throughout the week. Check out their website to see what's what. But whatever you do, GO! This is one of Concord's best and most consistent places for tasty food."}
{"text":"I wish we lived closer to this restaurant it is awesome. My wife and I drive an hour to get here and it has always been worth the drive. I love the buffalo chicken sandwich but you better be hungry or plan to take some home. My wife gets the chicken philly and it is worthy. The girls are always attentive to both of us. They have theme nights and dress accordingly. They have a biker night, a school girl night,and a pajamma jam night making it very fun place. The girls dress provocatively but hey were all adults here and its not as bad as it sounds."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch so I can't speak to the bar aspect of the place. Saying \"biker bar\" might scare some people away, but during the lunch hours, it really is your average crowd with some good food.

I probably would have never gone here if it wasn't for my boss knowing of the place; I would have been thrown off by the biker bar aspect. But I was really surprised at the place, especially with the food. They have a great menu, filled with your traditional American choices, but everything we ordered at the table was better than I expected. I hear the wings are pretty good too, so I'd give those a try.

As for the atmosphere, this place gives off the vibe they want, considering the large bar area & skimpy waitress outfits. I think they only hire attractive females to wait on you, which also adds to the \"biker\" theme of the place. With plenty of tvs around the place, it wouldn't be a bad place to catch a game either.

If you're in the area shopping at Concord Mills, then you could grab some good lunch here for a pretty good price."}
{"text":"Good food but wait staff is mediocre at best.  Tried to put another patrons bill on my tab..sorry, pay for your own friends as I sure wont.  Wouldn't go back.  If you're into pregnant chics that think they can rip you off then this is your mecca."}
{"text":"Iron Thunder Saloon is locked-on!  I am a fan!  I've, personally, never had their food, but I am a fan of the scenery and Krystal (sp?) one of their AM bartenders.  She's very easy on the eyes and knows how to pour mixed drinks!  They're located right by Speedway H-D in Concord close to the Hooters and the main drag of exit 49 of the 85.  Come on in especially if you're a H-D rider; this place is made for bikers.  The girls are HOT and the drinks are cold!  Can't vouch for the food (yet), but have never heard anyone complain about it.  I'll definitely be back to see Krystal; she's good to go.  =D"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar with plenty of big screens,music,billiards plenty of beers on draft.
They have specials everyday on drinks and food. 
The girls dress up to a different theme every night.
Very spacious inside not a bad choice of your looking for something different."}
{"text":"The service was extremely poor and the staff and management was rude.  I wouldn't go back.  Also, the place was almost dead."}
{"text":"If you want a ridiculously large buffalo chicken sandwich, then here you go.  It's like $8 or so, and it's HUGE, we can split it and still not be able to finish it all."}
{"text":"Very nice waitress but seemed totally overwhelmed. We've had her on 2 separate occasions and they are severely understaffed. We've visited here 5 or so times and the service never improves. Menu is full of great options and the food is good. Great atmosphere but once again., If you need to be out of a restaurant in less than an hour this  might not be the one. Plenty of other options in this area."}
{"text":"Well... big surprise... wasn't expecting much, but the food was actually on point.  My wife had the wings and they were good and crispy... I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich $8 and no joke there was a double sized (no less than a pound) chicken breast that there is no way you could fit in two sandwiches.  The chicken was tender and it is now on the top of my list for buffalo chicken in the Charlotte area... we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a loyal Yelper, when I am on the road I do try to try some of the local eateries instead of the well known chains.  So when the small sign on the interstate (the one that lets you know what restaurants are at that exit) has on the bottom of the sign \"where the locals go\" I decided to give it a try.

I knew it was in front of the Harley Davidson dealership, and from the name I expected a biker friendly decor and menu, and assumed that the female wait staff would probably be wearing something like jeans and tank tops.  I was wrong on the last part.

Evidently the female bar and wait staff dress in various outfits based on a theme.  The theme on this day was lingerie.  I seated myself and really wasn't paying attention when my server came to the table and asked what I wanted to drink.  I wasn't expecting to look up and see a well endowed female wearing lingerie ready to take my food order!

I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich.  When it arrived at the table I was blown away at the size of it.  It was served open faced with a side of fries and some ranch dressing.  I ordered it with the medium heat sauce, and that was just the right amount of heat.  Had a good flavor.  Managed to eat half of it before I threw in the towel.  Server brought me a to go box - without me having to request it.

Server was polite.  She appeared at the right times with drink refills, the to go box, and the check.  

Place has tvs everywhere.

Definitely a different place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the negative reviews for service. My wife and I walked in and was greeted immediately. We were offered drinks within a few minutes and the food came out quick and tasty. Yes the outfits were nice as well. I am a stickler for customer service. We were well taken care of. I would return if we pass back through the area and would be a regular if we lived here. It is a fun clean place with fair prices and nice environment. Looks like several locals go there which is what we always look for when traveling."}
{"text":"Great food. Cold beer. And good service. Would recommend to visit here. We got here around 5 on a Wednesday night the place was not busy. We got waited on right away. The wait staff were friendly and dressed as you would assume. Overall our experience was great."}
