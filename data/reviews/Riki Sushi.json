{"text":"The service here is amazing! Very friendly and accommodating. The food is good as well, and the service is always prompt!"}
{"text":"Change in ownership. Sushi is pretty mediocre now, although cheap. Low grade fish and seafood (and we didn't even order the all you can eat)"}
{"text":"Pretty standard sushi restaurant for this area, standard menu, they do an AYCE.  Food is about average as well as price.   They definitely cannot handle a full restaurant and our most recent experience was disappointing. Server forgot a lot of menu items for people throughout the restaurant, seemed untrained and tried to charge us for the forgotten menu items. No apologies or extra courtesy for this either. I don't think I'd recommend this restaurant over other ones in the area, probably would recommend to avoid it if they seemed busy.   The food we did receive seemed rushed, the salad they gave us was completely drowned in dressing, which was gross. :("}
{"text":"Great people, great service. The service is outstanding, very kind people.  They were very patient when we moved tables a few times. My friend and I ate a veggie platter we both loved. The tempura in our bento box was very fresh and the sushi outstanding. Please do not consider old reviews, they have recently re-opened. Give them a chance. I rarely encounter such kindness."}
{"text":"Riki Sushi has excellent sushi and amazing prices. I have only done take out but it's always been delicious and the staff are very friendly.  I highly recommend this new neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Nice, simple and casual decor - perfect lighting. Music @ good volume. 5 stars.  Food: Decent quality for AYCE food for a great price - 4 stars for that.  Service: Super friendly and courteous service! 6 stars for that!  5 stars over all :D"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant has been in the neighbourhood for awhile, but I believe has had a makeover recently and introduced AYCE to their establishment. I tried out two of their rolls and an appetizer to test the waters before plunging into their AYCE option.  I order the Riki Roll and Freedom Roll, and they were delicious. If you're a fan of bbq eel and avocado, Riki has a lot of options that include those two ingredients. The two rolls I had seemed like they were made with fresh ingredients, but were loosely rolled together. Nothing that can't be fixed with a bit more practice. Im not expecting too much from a low-key sushi restaurant just starting anew.  Their service was average, the wait staff was quite nice about me staying a little bit pass their closing time, along with a neighbouring couple who were also there late at night.   Overall, I would come back to their restaurant and give their AYCE option a try since their sushi rolls are quite decent, seemingly fresh ingredients and good combination."}
{"text":"Fresh food, friendly service and very reasonable prices. We had the salmon lovers and tuna lovers meals. Both were delicious and the portions were very generous. Our server was helpful and the food came quickly. Will definitely be back!"}
