{"text":"It's adequate.  That's really all I can say. It's inexpensive,  which helps.  But honestly, nothing stands out as being spectacular.  It just kind of gets the job done when you're hungry."}
{"text":"Love the fresh food. I get the penny club its amazing. Staff is great. Much better than Subway."}
{"text":"Some of the best sub's around. Bread and veg are great. The meat is good to but a little thin and could use a bit more in the sub. The service has always been good.  Very friendly and helpful. They are good at giving advice on there product ."}
{"text":"Their subs are so incredibly delicious. Everything always tastes so fresh. They have decent prices and great specials too. I have also tried their pastas and they are equally delicious. This location delivers to my house too, which is an added bonus. They are always quick to deliver and very friendly."}
{"text":"We use to go there however it seems like they started skimping on the meat.  Too much filler stuff and not enough meat and the customers think maybe I could just do this at home."}
{"text":"I have to say they are better than Subway, that's for sure. At least they put meat and cheese and the fixing's on your Sub not like subway where they measure everything and you get home and you pretty much just taste the bread. The staff is young but very polite and helpful. Maybe a little suggestion...if you can make homemade salads like Macaroni, potato salad it would be alot better."}
{"text":"One of the best subs I've had in a long time. Definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Hands down the best customer service..!and even better subs the wheat bread is super good I've been coming here for many years..the subs are better than Subway or port-o- subs thats for sure..! Besides who wants to eat at a place named after a dirty subway or a stinky port-o-potty..? Not me"}
{"text":"confirmed better than subway blimpie quiznos etc etc  Not really much else to say that hasnt been said above. Wished they had more vegetarian options :("}
{"text":"The Sandwiches taste very good and I like the bread and turkey better than Subway, good sandwich shop, and kind workers."}
{"text":"Always pleases and puts a smile on my face. The bread is always fresh and flavorable. The toppings are plentiful  and fresh. Perhaps the best sub sandwich for reasonable price. The chocolate chip cookies are homemade and a so delish."}
{"text":"We saw this place and since it's close by, we would go there - I ordered two 16\" subs - and the bread was so fresh! They also have an awards (after ten, get one free) and I got a free cookie for being my first visit! Will order here again as well."}
{"text":"I didn't really like Mr. Goodcents. Their food is great, but the employee was not. He could hardly talk and got HALF of my WHOLE ORDER WRONG!When I ask for a 6 inch tuna on wheat, I don't what a 12 inch ham on white bread!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to the grand opening and had the best sandwiches! When we went to leave at 9pm I happened to have left my cell phone on the booth where we sat.  Not knowing I left my phone I got home called the store whoever answered the phone said that no one turned my phone in.  Drove back confronted the store manager and did a walk through.  Still couldn't find the phone.  Had the iPhone locator app that said my phone was inside the store.  Did one last walk around the outside of the store and pressed the locate button on the app, low and be hold the phone was placed nicely on the outside trash bin!  Not cool not cool.  Please read this and pass this along.  Someone with in the staff their tonight is SHADDY...WATCH OUT!"}
{"text":"Love coming here and have come on weekends a lot. I have been coming to this location since I went to college at ASU West years ago. I am used to good service, and there is one guy that works here now that always gives great service. Today I stopped in and was NOT greeted by 2 young girls who seem to hate their jobs and their lives. They were not wearing name tags, but the girl with long dyed black hair working the meat slicer, definitely gave me the worst customer service I've had. She demanded my order and acted like I was wasting her time. Didn't speak to me at all except for eye rolls and huffs.  After sitting down the manager walked by and I caught him. Mentioned that the service was horrible and explained to him why. He honestly didn't seem to care, but said he would \"watch them\". He apparently did talk to them because as I walked out I got a loud, \"Have a great day ma'am\" from the dark haired girl...with her arms crossed and a 'I hope you die' look on her face. I smiled back and said YOU TOO, but this location has lost my business. I will now be going to the location on 83rd and Bell."}
{"text":"You guys seriously have a line out the door and one dude working on a Saturday telling all the customers how his manager left him here by himself. Took 30 min for one sub."}
{"text":"I love the chicken alfredo pasta at Goodscents, and of course the amazing cookies. I came here tonight for my meal and unfortunately they forgot to give me my breadstick with it, which are also delicious. Can also be hit or miss on the staff---some are super friendly and some are either more reserved or just want to get you out of there. Overall, I'm a regular and I like it."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time yesterday and was thoroughly impressed. Great staff, great subs, and great cookies. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I went in here on Friday evening to get 3 full size subs.  I pulled out an old punch card and asked if they still accepted those... no they don't... but she gave me a big (30% I think..) discount.  Plus, they were already checking to see if a small party platter would be less expensive. Exceptional service and friendly smiling faces... oh and the sandwiches were delish!"}
{"text":"After some shopping at Norterra my husband was in the mood for a sub. He saw a sign for Jersey Mike's & headed over. When we got closer we saw the \"coming soon\" part. Haha, he was bummed. Then I used my handy Yelp app on my phone & found Mr. Goodcents, which is only a couple miles from our house. We got there a lil after 7 & there were a couple people ahead of us in line. I decided on the Nickle sub which had capicola ham, pepperoni & salami. I got the 8 inch on white & added  provolone cheese, lettuce, pickles & mustard. Hubby ordered the Penny sub which had turkey, ham & roast beef. He got the 12 inch on white & added swiss cheese, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pepperoncinis & oil & vinegar. We both got combos with drinks, but I got a cookie & he got chips. Total for both meals was a lil over $15. The subs were very fresh & tasty, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Subway clone but not as efficient. Seemed to be some confusion as to how loud the music should be, It went from reasonable to way too loud back to reasonable again during my 15 minute lunch. Ozzie Osbourne screaming is not everybodys idea of a relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"Tried this place for first time.  Will have to agree with other Yelper that they skimp a bit on the meat.  Couple extra slices of each would be nice.  Did like fact that they don't slice meat until you order, so you're not getting pre-fabbed meat packets that you don't know how long they've been out.  Sub did have good flavor and liked the freshness of the bread.    May try another location just to see how they compare."}
{"text":"I had a chicken bacon ranch sub toasted. I highly recommend this sub it's great. Also they are always nice here And make me want to come back. Also I recommend their chicken Parmesan pasta it's amazing!!! Overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious! I have only tried their club and Italian subs, but they were amazing. I love how they cut the meat and cheese right when you order it, and their bread...mmmm, so good and fluffy. Their staff is friendly, too. The prices are excellent compared to the other sub shops around. They have specials every day, but my favorite is the Sunday special where you can get two cold footlongs for $8.99. Score!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, the bread is not dry very fresh, meats and combos work awesome. Clean location and the service is fast. Basic, quick and good you need to try."}
{"text":"I dont understand how subway is still in business! The bread, the meats, the veggies are all on point. Ordered the goodcents original meal and i have not been this satisfied from a sandwich in a long time. Fast friendly service and great prices."}
{"text":"I really like the Goodcents chain. I would eat here 100% of the time over subway, but this particular location doesn't seem to get a lot of business and as such seems to have a less fresh product than other locations. With that said, I would still choose the slightly less than fresh Mr. Goodcents over subway."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sub shop! Its the only place i will get a sub sandwich! I have been going here for over 10 years and i NEVER get tired of it! Mitch is an awesome owner and he really cares about the customer! MUST GO!"}
{"text":"Yummy omg best place ever i am in love first time i ever went and now i am a regular i have only ever tried the ultimate blt but its the best"}
{"text":"Goodcents is a friendly place, and the guys behind the counter are having a good time while they work. I give Five stars for service.   The reason why we end up at three stars is based on two separate meals.   First meal was a CBR. It was great, nearly flawless. As well as great customer service.   The second meal was a buffalo chicken sandwich. This thing was a beautiful disaster. I can't imagine it was intended to be made so excessively. The thing was like eating bread dipped in buffalo. I wouldn't have finished it if I wasn't so hungry. None the less I did.   So I will be giving Goodcents a third try, and I'm positive my next experience will boost them up to the full five stars. They missed the mark with this buffalo atrocity though."}
{"text":"Outstanding place to eat.  Very affordable and far better than Subway.  Quiet and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Um. We just moved to the area and I saw this deli style sub place was near AND delivers!!! I've been looking for another place since the last deli sub place I loved closed :( This place is AMAZING!!! Softest bread ever- the onions are sliced so thin, unlike Subways huge onion chunks :-/ lots of cheese choices... Seriously ate it so fast! Also got a cookie which was still warm. Delivered. We are definitely going to call this our favorite sandwich shop!! Can't wait to try the other kinds of sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!  Always get the toppings right. Fresh ingredients and the breads are so good!  We always get delivery. Friendly on the phone as well as the delivery guys!!"}
{"text":"I've always been obsessed with Mr. Goodcents and I'll happily give them 5 stars.  I have been enjoying the best subs EVER for about 16 years now.  They must be doing something right if they've been around for so long!  They cannot be equaled.  I live in San Diego now, but I still have to have my Goodcents fix when I come into town.  It's a must!  Cheese Mix is my lifeblood and the bread is unbelievably soft and seems to melt in your mouth.  Sometimes, if I'm in a soup mood, they have some seriously tasty broccoli cheese.  In college, I frequented the Tempe and Mesa Goodcents because they were closer to my apartment, but the T-Bird shop was my first and it just feels like home.  I'll always love you Goodcents.  I'll see you in my dreams until our next clandestine rendezvous...    P.S. Not that you need it, but sometimes I wish you had avocado.  Even still...5 stars!"}
{"text":"By far superior to blimpie, subway, Quiznos and others serving the same type of sandwiches.  The price is right and the service is exceptional for a sandwich joint. They build your sandwich with care and patients unlike when I go to subway and the sandwich artist treats me as if I'm ruining their day.    Try goodcents and experience the difference."}
{"text":"Great subs... Horrible customer service.   Decided to go to my favorite sandwich shop Mr. Goodcents today. Was a rainy day so no other customers were around. Walked in and the cashier (the only one to have any customer service skills) was changing the bag to the garbage. There was a woman on the slicer who looked up as we walked in and looked back down, a younger guy who seemed more interested in flirting with the girl next to him at the sandwich station. Not one of these people greeted us, smiled...  we felt awkward the entire time. Like we were bothering them. When the lady on the slicer was done cutting the bread she handed the top half to the guy next to her and he threw it at the girl he was standing next to. The whole experience was a mess and very disappointing. The only positive was the cashier. Who was polite and friendly.  Definitely will not be returning to this Goodcents."}
{"text":"Great food and such friendly and engaging workers!  Will definitely come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Mr. Goodcents closed during road construction and has since reopened as Goodcents Subs and Pastas. Not much has changed since they lost the \"Mr.\" the ingredients and menu seem to be the same as always. The daily specials have been switched up, Sundays now offer two footlongs for $8.50. It's still a great deal that hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Welcome to the neighborhood. I love the fact they deliver and it's so quick. They had my sandwiches to my house in 15 minutes, that's impressive. They have a great drive through were there was no wait today and my sandwich came out amazing and quick. I so nice to be able to run through somewhere and get food that is not greasy."}
{"text":"Good subs, much better than the big chain stores. Good pricing for what you get, good job!"}
{"text":"Dear Subway, although we have had a delightful relationship over the years, I must confess that I have recently started frequenting another sub shop ... Goodcents. While I enjoy the aroma of fresh baked bread and a happy greeting when I enter your doors, Goodcents has been able to provide for me in ways that you have not. I must confess, it's true... portion size does matter. And while you can provide 6 inches or 12 inches of delectable options, Goodcents can provide me with 6 inches, 8 inches, 12 inches or even 16 inches of satisfying deliciousness. Also, Goodcents has bared its soul, thinly slicing its meats and cheeses right in front of me when I order. It's refreshing. I'll still visit you, Subway... afterall, Goodcents isn't everywhere. At least not yet. But I thought you should know that they have stolen my heart."}
{"text":"This is a nice sub place, they have the basics but nothing out of the ordinary, actually a little low in the selections but good enough. The best was the bread which was very soft and fresh but I really did not see anything that warrants such high reviews. Yes they are definitely better than subway  but I did not see anything that particular great. They did sliced the meat when you ordered it, did it make a whole lot of difference, maybe a little but not to make the sub that much better. The portion of meat was not as great as some of the reviewers made it out to be. They do give you a little more, but it was very much a little. The seasoning are very basic and same as other sub places. When I was in the midwest, small sub places use to make special sauces, every place had their own concoctions which gave their subs character. I really did not see anything that stood out to me. Is it a good sub place, yeah a little above the average chain, but still a chain. Lacks something different and special with their subs to really stand out. Good place if you are looking for a better subway."}
{"text":"Five stars for the great price and incredibly friendly service! And the food was good too :)  We are new to the area and have a favorite sub place back in Michigan called Jersey Giant where everything is freshly sliced and huge. We don't eat very much bread so it is a treat for us to share a big veggie sub. We are NOT fans of Subway at all, and were sort of resigned to just not having subs while in AZ, but then noticed this place very close to where we are living. After checking out the Yelp reviews we decided to give it a shot. Atmosphere was very mom and pop - I think the owners were working that day and they were very nice and joking around with us. Clean place, line not too bad.  We are vegetarian so didn't benefit from the freshly sliced deli meat part of it, and were just a little bummed to see that the cheese is not freshly sliced. We ordered a $5 foot-long cheese mix with only provolone. The sub was very well made - perfect amounts of toppings, a generous amount of cheese, and toppings out to the edges (important since we are always splitting). We ordered it exactly like we get at Jersey Giant - standard dress (LOVE the oregano) with extra tomatoes, banana peppers, and extra mayo. It was super delicious, almost as good as our favorite sub ever, so we were happy! Will definitely be back for our once-in-a-while sub treat."}
{"text":"So I usually don't review places since I work in the industy. But Good cents deserves the review. I ordered online. This was my first experience with this establishment.  Their online is simple and easy to navigate. It said my order would be done at 2:13. I arrived at 2:08. The restaurant is clean and nice. The staff is nicer! All smiles and greetings from every employee. I told them I was there for a pick up and they were bagging my order as we spoke. The staff gave the place a nice vibe.  Got home and let me tell you this is where their good impression was solidified. We ordered 5 differ and each one was amazing!  I have the pickiest kids and they absolutely loved their subs. We found our new sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this location. I absolutely love good cents but this location is constantly out of ingredients and the service is slow. That can get very frustrating. Just once I would like to get everything I actually wanted on my sub. Also I live less than a mile from this location and when I order for delivery it takes them over an hour to get my order to me. Great company but they definitely have better locations"}
{"text":"Me and my daughter stopped at this place formerly known as Mr. Good cents, to get her a meatball sandwich as usual. By far this is the best meatball sandwich she has had according to may daughter."}
{"text":"Goodcents is my favorite sandwich shop in Phoenix and I'm sad that I don't currently live closer to one. I used to live half a mile from this location and would get a sandwich at least once a week.  Their bread beats Subway any day and is always tasty without being too much. They slice the meats and cheeses when you order and the portions of meat are generous. I liked that I could order an 8\" sandwich instead of just 6\" or 12\".  Because I came here often enough the staff would recognize me and I was sad when I had to tell them I was moving to the other side of town. Every time I came in after that they kept asking me how my house purchase was going and how many more times I'd be in. It's rare to be sad about \"leaving\" a restaurant because of the people as much as you'll be sad to miss out on the food.  They have a different special every day and on Wednesdays you get to grab a card for a free something (drink, chips or cookie). Their cookies are yummy so that was always my favorite to get! They have the soda machine with the million flavor combinations.  I'll be coming back whenever I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent good fresh and delicious with many choices at a great price.  You get it made your way with many different choices of meats cheeses and toppings. Thru also have pastas but I recommend subs they are better."}
{"text":"I'm gluten free so I've eaten here (not will I), but my wife and daughter rave about this place. We live 20 miles away from here and when we get in this neighborhood they have to their subs.      Freshly shaved meat, fresh cheese (except the Parmesan- it came from paper packages from some pizza joint) and bread. Apparently this place rocks."}
{"text":"I had seen this place many times next to Fed Ex. I always wanted to try it, so I finally did. I did not know that it was a chain, now I do. It smelled quite good in here, like baking bread. It was quite busy as well. Which means that people like it. Lots of choices here for sure. Lots of bread and meat choices. What we got was the BBQ Pork and the BBQ chicken. On the Sandwich makers suggestion both on Hawaiian Sweet Bread. Plus they toasted them. You can get any type of bread and any toppings. We only got cheese and tomatoes.  We also ordered soup, one chicken noodle and one Cream of Broccoli. Neither of us were very excited about the soup. The Noodles in the Chicken were very think and the bits of Chicken were very hard. The Broccoli was watery. Anyway ,the Sandwiches were good. They were nice and hot also. The place is clean and every thing comes to you very quickly. So all good in that department. They also have punch cards ,which is another plus."}
{"text":"Was waiting at the barber shop and dropped in here to grab a drink. Guy was way chill and hooked me up with a free drink.  Thanks goodscents"}
{"text":"This is an interesting sandwich place that I have tried a few times. The sandwiches are pretty good, but the prices seem a little expensive to me for what it is. I like their brownies, but the cookies weren't all that good. It can take awhile to get your sandwich, as the line didn't move very fast when I was there. The employees are friendly though and that makes for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever.  One of the best sub places in the area.  Friendly staff and great pricing.  They shave the meat and cheese right in front of you so you know it is fresh.   Today I visited Mr. Goodcents and I ordered the Penny Sub without ham.  The sandwich maker added a couple extra pieces of roast beef and turkey to compensate.  The bread was soft and the overall sandwich was great as it normally is.  We seemed to get into the place just in time because the place filled up right after we sat down (I guess word could have gotten out that I came in.)    This place is leaps and bounds ahead of Subway so do yourself a favor and pick this place when you have your next hankerin'  for a tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"Great Sandwich shop, their employees are friendly and their sandwiches are great! I went with an Italian add turkey toasted and it was fantastic. Bonus is that their not priced badly, coming in better than mikes or subway"}
{"text":"The people who work here are super nice. Decent sandwiches but it is a great option in a pinch."}
{"text":"Loved these sandwiches! Freshly carved meat when you order and fresh veggies. The lady that helps us was so informative and had great customer service!!! They have great specials and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The delivery was on time and the sandwich did not disappoint! I will definitely be a new regular :-)"}
{"text":"I do online orders to be delivered to my husband at his job. Every single order has been correct and they actually read the special instruction note. I never knew about goodcents until I got such crappy service from Jimmy johns. Fyi every order was wrong and their manager admitted his employees don't bother to read the instructions note! Anyways so glad I found goodcents! Subs are great and the service is great!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Mr. Goodcents subs!!!! The bread is  always fresh and delicious. I appreciate the fact that they slice the meat and cheese in front of you. Plus they are reasonably priced and WAY better than Subway.   Today I had the turkey and pepperoni $5 special. It was delicious as usual. The staff there are always friendly and pretty quick when making your sub (even though it was lunch time on a saturday and they were trying to make party platter orders)."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse customer service at the Surprise location. I have been here a few times and the treatment is always the same you are treated as if your are making their day worse buy coming in and placing a simple order. It is up to the owner and the manager to hire people that want to be there they should be reading reviews and hiring mystery shoppers or continue to lose customers."}
{"text":"I don't know what to think of the place.  I like the idea of them carving your deli meat as soon as you order, but the countertops where they made they actual sandwiches was filthy. There were left over crumbs, slices of lunch meat, old lettuce everywhere.  It would't hurt for the place to occasionally in between making a sandwich, take a rag and give the countertop a good wipe!  I don't think I'd come again .. just wasn't that impressive!"}
{"text":"Some of the best subs around. I think. They cut the meat right when you order your sandwich then put exactly what you want on it. I always get Standard Dress which is all the basics. I love the Original and the Penny Club but I don't think they have a bad sandwich. Everyone I've taken there likes it too. I get teased at work for going there so much for lunch but I like it and it's close. Plus during the week the owners are working the line and that's cool. They remember you if you go in there enough but you still get a big hello even if it's your first time. Having a Coke Freestyle machine is always a plus for any restaurant. I don't think you can do much better. Great sandwiches, friendly people and pretty cheap. It may not be a $5 foot long but for an extra dollar you get a lot better quality."}
{"text":"They made our very proportionate sandwiches very quickly and extremely polite. What a great experience at this location !!!!!  Yumm"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming here for years. Someone needs to tell the blonde NOT to spray the glass cleaner directly on the sneeze shield.  The long haired guy with the beard she was working with tried to tell her and she said that was the dumbest thing she has ever heard and continued to spray the glass instead of spraying the rag first. Then she told the long haired guy about a customer that complained when he saw her doing it. This girl should not be in the food service business. I've been a loyal customer and it makes me sad to see someone like her spraying cleaner toward the food. Nobody wears name tags either so I don't know her name."}
{"text":"First of all, I've lived less than 2 miles next to this place for just over a year now.  I had no idea it was even here in Surprise.... Its a hidden Gem.. the crew was very friendly and out going..  I Met Mitch the owner who was also very friendly and Happy to help in any way.. l ordered the 16\" Italian.   The Bread was amazing..  very soft and fresh... they hand slice the meats and cheeses right in front of you.  the Oregano really made the sandwich Pop.  I Travel a lot for work and visit many sandwich shops, and this one is right up there with the best of them...from N.Y. to S. Cal..  I will be dropping Subway and coming here a lot more."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the last two days and very impressed.  Nothing fancy just a solid sandwich shop that blows away subway any day of the week.  The fresh bread and veggies really make the sandwiches stand out here.  Good pricing and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the sandwich's are huge!! The price isn't too bad and I love the manny different sizes of sandwiches you can get. The chipotle cheese steak was delicious. Will definitely be ordering from here again. Also the driver was extremely kind and delivered quickly"}
{"text":"for $5.99 you get a great sub, 12\" long, fresh meat and ingredients, perfectly soft bread. Try it and you will like it."}
{"text":"They serve very fresh sandwiches and they have a different flavor all their own.  Yes it may just be a sandwhich, but this location has very freindly staff & great chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"The best! Staff is great, store is clean, delivery is fast and friendly, price is great, and subs are awesome! My kids love this place! They cut your selection of meat and cheese fresh to order.  Bread is light and delicious. Order from here often."}
{"text":"Did someone just step on my sandwich?  OMG.  Actually no.  But that's kind of what a Mr. Goodcents sandwich looks like - kind of flat and smooshed.   But it tastes just fine, don't let the looks scare you off.  I frequent this place for lunch often, and for a $4 sub you're better off here than at healthy Subway, Blimpie, or fatty Quiznos.  It's a counter service deli chain with a handful of locations in the Valley.  They make the sandwiches and slice the meat and cheese right in front of you.  The owner/manager is very friendly and helpful.  I've had the original and penny club - decent choices, although I think the slices are a bit skimpy.   The bread looks thin and crummy, but it's actually not as bad as it looks.  I don't know why they're subs look smooshed...weird.  They have pasta here, but have never had it - and not so sure about it either...."}
{"text":"Great food. Super friendly staff. Always a quick and easy bite to eat that's healthy."}
{"text":"Always great music playing. Classic rock, not too loud but definitely adds to the chill ambiance"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times. The atmosphere was inviting. I love that they cut the meat as you order it (I like my meat super thin). The veggies are fresh and the bread is soft. The customer service was good."}
{"text":"I cannot put into words how good Mr. Goodcents really is. Where I used to work I couldn't leave for lunch so I ordered from them everyday for over a year. I tried EVERYTHING on their menu, and EVERYTHING was delicious! You really can't compare a Mr. Goodcents sub to Subway or Quiznos, they're practically a category all their own. :)"}
{"text":"We have been going here for years now and after yesterday we think it is time for a break.   Not sure if the place has changed hands but, it has definitely gone south. It's a tale of two shifts really. Seems like there has been some turnover and the night shift has the most struggles. Yes they do try but, they are just not trained properly for a dinner rush.  Yesterday, I stop in at 530, first in line, to stand there as the ONE employee (one guy for dinner rush) slowly works to complete two pickup orders. Ten minutes pass, line beginning to form behind me and still waiting for service. Another employee in back on their cell. Yes, I got apology but, hey , I'm here in line - pickup is not, take my order or call for help from other guy, nothing.  Customer enters for the pickup order and finally employee in back appears to finish one order. Now 15+ minutes in, my first sandwich order is taken - a hot buffalo chix sub - he disappears to do the single sandwich, line behind me is now 5 customers deep.   Another pickup order hops line to grab their sandwiches which, I know but they don't - have been sitting open on a prep table waiting to be dressed for 20 minutes now, bread has to be stale.  Finally, my first sandwich is done and wrapped. I have three more to order.  Another female employee arrives from a delivery return, then promptly leaves these two guys to drown.  Sandwiches 2,3, & 4 - slowly made - finally - 40 minutes later, with a line of 6-7 customers behind me, I get to register. Employee struggles to ring up $4 sandwiches - unsure of which discount button to press. I'm done but, the line looks to be an angry mob now.  As I walk out the female manager/employee finally returns to help and I overhear her trying to calm a situation which has now gone sideways. If she is in charge - she dropped the ball big time leaving these guys alone when they were not ready, especially during a dinner rush.  Finally home - sandwiches:  Meat was plentiful, toppings as well but, the bread was terrible. We all got pepper garlic and the bottom was either under cooked or crust was cut off and it was bland - no flavor - I see all the pepper n garlic but taste nothing? Strange!   This has been a pattern of poor/slow service recently that began a while back. Plus, the reward program has completely changed. Punch cards are gone, now you give a phone number but, I have no idea how close I am to a free sub or anything for that matter.   Unfortunately, we have decided to take or weekly business elsewhere until management wakes up. Sorry Mr. Goodcents it's u - not me."}
{"text":"Me thinks not, based on HORRIBLE customer service and was never able to try the food. I arrived at this location on May 2, 2017 at 12:02pm. As I entered, there was no line. Two patrons sitting down in separate locations eating food and 3 people making sandwiches at a furious pace, 1 cashier looking at the register, 1 girl in a black shirt behind the second counter and 2 people wandering in the back. There was no one in line. I was the third customer in the shop. Lets count the employees in the shop shall we, 7 were seen. Seven! I walked up to the ordering station and after about a minute, I came to a decision on what I wanted to order 12:03pm. Fade to 12:05pm, while standing there waiting for three minutes, the girl in the black shirt called for someone to help the customer (me). The cashier came to the prep table and put on her gloves and started helping the furious 3 make subs. 12:06pm, the young man slicing the meat for these phantom subs, no they were real, I guess they were for a call in order or a business order, who knows. Anyway, he tells me \"WE will be with you in a bit\" First, he should have said that at 12:02:10pm. It took him 4 minutes to acknowledge me verbally. I know he saw me, just chose to ignore me. After 4 minutes of waiting and another waiting till \"bit\" I walked out of the store. This sad story does have a happy ending. After about a 6 minute drive to Jimmy Johns on Bell and something, I walked into the store which was very busy, and within 5 seconds, got a \"Hi, welcome to Jimmy Johns, what can I get for you\" It took me about 30 seconds to decide and I placed my order. There were 4 people ahead of me and 3 minutes later, sub in hand, I was walking out of the store a happy customer. Freaky Fast, Right!?! So, based off looking at the reviews for Goodcents, The subs are good and the service is terrible. I wish I could have tried one of the subs. Myself being new to the area, I hope I do not encounter this type of service. I don't need it and nor do you. Side note: It was noon time and only 2 other patrons were in the store eating? Que the X-Files theme, \"do doo do doo doo dooooo."}
{"text":"It was my first time here today. Location is perfect since it is right by ASU West! The outside looks a little bit old and run down. I walked in and the inside was also old and run down too. The employee greeted me. He was so kind and patient with me! I was taking forever to choose what I wanted. I finally chose. He made exactly what I ordered. They cut the cheese right in front of you!  No, they don't pass flatulence. They cut meat in front of you too. I will say, the vegetables looked a bit old. I paid about $8 for an 8\" Italian sandwich, chips, and a drink. They have those cool soda machines that give you 2696531790 options! DECISIONSSSSSSS. I finished my meal, got a free cookie for doing a survey, and left.    There really is nothing too special about this place. What DID make it memorable was the sweet and patient employee BRANDON. You're awesome Brandon and you have a sweet beard!   And, done. *mic drop*"}
{"text":"The bread was very dry and very disgusting,I bought 30 dollars worth of food but ended up throwing it all out"}
{"text":"Today marked my first experience with eating at Mr. Goodcents.  I placed my order online and went to the location to pick up one sub for my lunch. I cannot say enough how surprised I was by the service I received.  When you order online (very user friendly) you can go straight to the register to pick up and pay for your food.  I ended up waiting tops 3-4 minutes for my sub and the counter lady could not have been nicer or more pleasant over the very small wait.  She apologized and checked immediately on my sub to make sure it was being completed and offered me a drink while I waited. The woman who made my sub brought it to me and made sure to tell me she changed her food handling gloves because I wrote I had an allergy to onions and she wanted to reassure me that there had been no cross contamination.   Over the years I have had many restaurants brush off my concerns over onions being in my food and to have someone go out of their way to assure me they listened was the best way to start off my relationship with this restaurant. I will definitely be back again in the future."}
{"text":"Good food and price is right. I am only rating 3 stars because every time I come here I am dissapointed with the customer service. The employees just treat you like a production line. They never smile or act like they enjoy their job. I can see where they get it because every time the owner is on the \"production line\" he has a very stern face and never smiles or greets you.  The only reason I come back is for the good food definantly not for the welcoming atmosphere.  P.S. the customers can hear the arguing and complaining when the workers are behind the wall."}
{"text":"My go to spot for a sandwich. I hate subway with a passion, so its nice to see that there is a place close to me that lets me get my sandwich fix."}
{"text":"I love Goodcents way better than Subway.  Their bread, meats and cheeses are so fresh.  They slice the meat and cheese right there for you.  In addition t bread is heavenly...They are fast, courteous, and clean. I've never had a bad experience here.   Just an FYI I get the veggie sub on wheat. My wife like their tuna sub Goodcents is super clean and super efficient.  Easy parking lot to get in and out of as well  FOOD: Excellent sub sandwiches. They don't skimp on their toppings.  When I want a sub I choose this place over Subway. PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:  Fast, friendly service. Very personable, Sam kept our soda and iced tea filled to the brim. CONCULSION: There's really not much to say, I've never had a bad tasting sandwich from there and they have never messed up. Makes me wonder how I put up with subway all these years.  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!"}
{"text":"I come to Mr good cents because they have good food. I usually don't order anything besides a penny club and a bowl of soup to go with..   This location NEVER makes broccoli cheddar soup even though it's a regular menu item..   Other than this issue the food is good and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Really nice people as well. Only complaint is that the delivery takes a little while. If they delivered faster they would be the best."}
{"text":"Turkey very bland no flavor. Bread is decent. Got three different types of sandwiches and we all left half on our table. Prefer firehouse or jimmie johns"}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would give this place anything higher than 3 stars. Two transparent slices of cheese and two paper thin slices of meat does not constitute a sandwich. The service is painfully slow every time, and you can say exactly how you would like things but they can only handle one task at a time. Example:\"I would like a roast beef on white with provolone cheese.\" Response: What kind of bread would you like? (Gets bread) What kind of cheese would you like? (Searches for cheese) only part they heard was 'roast beef'. Really?? Every single time. I went back three times hoping one sandwich was decent or it was just that person that was challenged in elementary tasks. Nope.   If you want an overpriced sloppy basket of disappointment you have found your place."}
{"text":"The meat and bread is so fresh that it makes Mr. Goodcents my number one sub place to hit up when in the mood for a sub"}
{"text":"I always order through the app and I am never disappointed. The staff is very friendly, great food and they have me on my way in about 1 minute."}
{"text":"Easy to deliver an very prompt polite..  They have fresh ingredients an nice delivery people not quite fast as Jimmy Johns but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say they are better or worse than subway as previous posters have, but what is true is that they don't have as many bread or topping choices. Meat is sliced as you order your sandwich. While I think that is kind of cool, it does make for a long wait in line. Bread is great, perfect blend of chewy and fluffy. Toppings seemed fresh. Sundays you can get 2 footlong subs for 8.99 - that's a pretty good deal. I'll probably be back if I'm in the area.  Oh, I will add that customer service lacked just a tad. It didn't affect me directly, other than what I overheard. A little girl had spilled her soda in the table area and the two guys behind the counter just kept going back and forth with \"I don't know who is going to clean it up\" and \"That's not my job\". It took one of them about 10 minutes to come out to clean it up. Meanwhile, other people were stepping in & over it."}
{"text":"i have been going to goodcents for years now and it's definitely the best place to get a sandwich! they slice the meat & cheese right in front of you, the bread is soft and always such great quality. i have a usual of turkey standard dress w no onions & provolone chz, but everything is good. the broccoli cheddar soup is a favorite of mine, and they run deals every day so everyone wins!"}
{"text":"After eating at other Goodcents locations for years, we were excited to see this new location open up a couple of miles from our house. However, having tried this new location a few times now, we have concluded that this is a very weak link in otherwise very good chain. The food quality is below that of other Goodcents locations. The pickup and dine-in experience is dissapointing. And the delivery service is totally unreliable. Of four delivery orders, two never reached us, two were late and, of those two, one was wrong. Not good. If you are someone who wants to roll the dice with your meal deliveries, prepare yourself for a likely negative surprise an hour or two later. As for us, we're done experimenting with this location. If a restaurant can't deliver, as promised, they shouldn't advertise a delivery service or take a customer's delivery order. I hope someone from the corporate office takes note of these issues and straightens things out, since it would be good to have a reliable Goodcents close by."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sub shop. The staff is incredibly friendly and greets me by my name (when I order online), which makes it feel so inviting. The subs are NO WHERE near Subway's! I go every week and never get sick of it."}
{"text":"My family and I walked in and were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait by the sandwich maker, because he was working on a large party platter. Meanwhile, a lady was putting cookies away and folding new packages. She also sent the other worker out to wipe down tables that were already clean. We waited about 10 minutes and listened to her complain to the guy that was making the sandwiches that they don't split tips with the employees that go in the back. I asked for the manager and learned it was the lady with the cookies and told her that she should be out helping instead of just standing around. She said she had to put the cookies away and still would not help us, so we walked out. We left and went to Filiberto's and spent $32, food and service was great there!"}
{"text":"Think of a subway, but better and cheaper.  The people behind the counter are friendly and helpful in sub selection.  What else is there to say, just go!"}
{"text":"First time going to this sand which shop. It was OK. They had a good selection of food and included pastas. Overall it was OK and in a hurry I would go back. I would just ask for extra sauce and meat and it was dry"}
{"text":"This place really isn't any better than subway. But, it is more expensive. The food is mediocre at best. It had very little flavor (I got the chipotle chicken cheesesteak) and was made with some nasty processed chicken-ish stuff. Gross. Absolutely nothing special about this overpriced subway with no spinach. They also had signs on their windows - one for wraps and one for $3.99 foot-long subs on Sundays with the purchase of a drink. Well, they didn't have ANY wraps and the sub deal only applied to SOME subs. Complete crap.   I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the guys working there were very nice."}
{"text":"This is my very first time trying and hearing about this place. I was pleasantly surprised. It's like a subway, but I would say they have better prices. The bread is nice and soft and the portions to me are generous. I got a 6 inch and it was enough to keep me full. If you want to go bigger, then hey ! Be my guest! The location was clean, and I even used the bathroom- which was really clean ! Skip subway and go here if you get a chance."}
{"text":"They make a great product,  love their subs we go there at least once every two weeks and prefer them over subway any day."}
{"text":"Ok, I love Mr. Goodcents. My co-workers and I have been coming here for about 12 years now. I love subs, and this one is my favorite. They are simple, the bread is soft, everything is fresh, the pepper jack cheese is yummy. Everyone is super nice in this franchise which isn't the case for a few of the other Mr. Goodcents franchises."}
{"text":"Back when I was in college, I loved going to the Mr Goodcents on Broadway and Roosevelt. I guess it has since closed, but I have always made sure to hit up Goodcents any time I'm in the area of one.   Fast forward to now, I've been back in this neighborhood for about 7 years and we have only had 2 Subways close by for sandwiches. I'm kind of a sandwich junky so when I saw this Goodcents open up I was sooooo stoked!!! I had to try it the next day and let me tell you it's up to par with all the other Goodcents I've had.   Here's what makes Goodcents so special, their light and fluffy bread and deli sliced meat. This is what makes it better than the competition. They have a great selection of fresh toppings, but so does everyone else. They have chips and fountain sodas just like everyone else. You can get some fresh baked cookies, same as the other guys. But you have to come here for delicious bread and deli sliced meats...unless you like mediocre bread and meat served up on plastic wrapper things, then you go to one of the 2 Subways in the area."}
{"text":"Good subs good everything eat here not lots but when I do I'm happy everytime. They are the best"}
{"text":"I stopped in today and this was my first visit. I ordered the original sub 8\" but seemed like a 6\" compared to Subway. I was dissatisfied with the service and amount of meat and veggie that was put on, only 2 slices of each meat!?? Only 2 tomatoes allowed!!??? Evey sub place puts on 3-4 slices of meat and at least enough tomatoes like 4 slices.... This location is a joke and the service, no customer service and just plain rude. Contacting corporate about this franchise."}
{"text":"So, I like the fact that the meat and cheese is freshly sliced.  That's about it.  They are charging WAY TOO MUCH.  I was there today and ordered a \"penny sub\", (one of their signature sandwiches).  I ordered and 8 inch sub.  I noticed that they sliced me two pieces of each meat, with the exception of the roast beef.  There should be TWO slices of each meat.  No just the \"less expense cuts\".  In addition to that, the meat is incredibly THINLY sliced, almost transparent.  I also got only two very thinly sliced tomatoes on my sandwich, where 4 slices would have fit the length of the bread.  This sandwich, (with the standard dress), meaning condiments, cost me $8.  NO DRINK, NO CHIPS, NO COOKIE.  If you want a foot long sub here, with chips and a drink, get ready to pay.  They are even cheap on the tomatoes!!!  How does this place stay in business????  I can get a better deal almost anywhere else, including Blimpie, and they fresh cut their meats and cheeses too."}
{"text":"We love the breads there. They make a nice fresh sub and cut all as you order them. Good variety of all different toppings. The crew is always very nice and accommodating.  Our go to place for subs now."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for the last 5 years. I have loved it. But the past year everything has gone downhill. Every time I go it takes forever to get in line. They are out of most of their toppings and the bread is dry and stale. Not to mention how the staff now treats you. Don't go to this location. Find another location or even a different chain."}
{"text":"Came here when no one was in the store. The service was so incredibly slow I couldn't believe it. The people that work there are clearly on drugs. I felt like calling in a wellness check for the 3 women there. One younger girl with fake eyelashes and pointy yellow fingernails came out when other customers started showing up (after about 25 minutes of us being there and they were just getting the meat on our subs) and she couldn't even get a pain of gloves because she was falling asleep standing up! Our 8 inch sandwich was not cut and staff unaware of the specials. I hope management does something about this for the good of the store. I used to love this place"}
{"text":"I've always had great experiences until today. The food is amazing but this review is solely regarding service.  I went to this location at about 5:00PM, there was one person in front of me ordering a sub and then no other customers. I asked for a party platter. The employee then advised I needed to give 24 hours notice, even though multiple times in the past I've had a platter made for me that same day.  He even asked me if I wanted to order subs separately, which I thought was interesting because there was no other customers and they clearly had time to make subs and cut them up for a platter. I could understand if they were busy but I was the only person waiting.  I may not come back to this location based off this experience."}
{"text":"Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me.   I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good."}
{"text":"A surprisingly simple setup that blows air-bending slaps around it's world-wide franchise counterparts. The bread is soft and bears no resemblance to any yeasty aromas of it's SUB-par rivals while the deli meats are sliced on the spot. You can't really go wrong with that alone."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch and sometimes dinner (my punch card even says so!)  Staff is super nice, price is super great, sandwiches are awesome!  They don't load up on the lettuce, give you tons of meat (which they slice in front of you) and it's just yummy.  Enjoy it!  A foot long did increase in price to $5.49 recently, but I'd gladly support this store!"}
{"text":"(I see this store has been listed twice, and I can say something positive under both listings.)  :-)    What a pleasant surprise in Surprise, AZ.  I urgently needed a restroom on my way to Las Vegas and there seems to be next to nothing on that stretch of highway 303.  Suddenly there's Goodcents, more like \"god sent.\"  Clean bathrooms, friendly staff, good food, too, as a bonus.  :-)   Thanks, Goodcents."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Mr. Goodcents for a while and was interested in their \"new\" toasted selections.  I ordered their California Turkey club, they took my name and disappeared to the back only to come back out and continue helping customers.  I figured it may take a minute or 2 so I let the customers behind me move ahead with their non-toasted selections.  Quite a bit of time passed and what had to be 10-15 minutes later a lady emerges from the back with my sandwich.  I got a \"sorry for the wait\" and took my sandwich to my table.  It was then I found out that the guacamole was left off, so all I had was a cheesy turkey sub.  I then had to go to 3 employees to get this guacamole, with another \"sorry\" to go with it.    Needless to say by the time this saga came to an end, the rest of my group was done eating and got to spectate as I ate my sandwich, as well as eating additional time off our lunch hour.  Pretty disappointing, maybe all sub shops aren't equipped for the toasted game.....or maybe they could have better communicated the ordeal that was to come."}
{"text":"We lived in Overland Park, Kansas and loved Mr Goodcents. The location in Tempe is no different. The subs are fresh and excellent quality. The best sandwiches EVER.    So why not a five star? The service today had me questioning whether I'd go back there.  We walk in (after a 20 minute drive just to get there) a guy puts on gloves and just stares at us, he's rolling his eyes and huffing. I finally say my order, realizing I'm not going to get a \"welcome or what can I get for ya.\"  He slams the bread on the counter. In an attempt to lighten the air, I ask very friendly, \"Having a bad day?\"  He stares for a few seconds and then answers with a NO. He continues to slam things around. The air was heavy.   My sub ended up wrong because everyone was distracted by the awkwardness. The whole experience put me in a bad, funky mood.  It's sad, because the other people who work there are always friendly."}
{"text":"Mr. Goodcents has delicious crisp subs. The meat and cheese are cut right in front of you and the bread is made fresh. The califonia sub is my favorite."}
{"text":"Today I went in to pick up my sub and it was not ready. Why?  Because I accidentally put 1 pm instead of 11 am.  The nice gentleman behind the counter assured me they can make my sub real quick and they did, and kept communication with me, that I didn't even know it was done already. Whoever made my sandwich....Was on point!!  All the ingredients evened out, just enough salt and pepper.  These guys at the 89th & Bell Rd location ROCK!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Freshly baked bread and sliced meat packed on. Great value for money compared to subway. I will take the extra 10 mins to get there for lunch more often :-)   ...and they have mozzarella. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Mr. goodcents is one of my favorite sub shops! The only reason for not giving full stars is because I ordered online and it was a Saturday. I got a confirmation email and was just patiently waiting for them to come!  About 25-30 minutes go by and I get a call at work from them telling me they are sorry but they actually don't deliver on Saturdays. Firstly, why would it be available if they don't offer it, and secondly why do they not deliver on one of the busiest days??   He told me he would notify the manager and make sure it is not available online for saturdays. He offered to refund me the delivery fee (umm obviously) and told me he would hook me up next time.... coooool"}
{"text":"I love this Mr. goodcents. it is a few miles from my house but other than convenience of location, the owner here is awesome. Every time I come in he always gives me a compliment of some sort. one night i had just got my hair done at the salon and when i walked in he said \"i love your hair!\" Way to make a girl feel special :) Everyone is always courteous behind the counter, fast, and the food is great. This is the only goodcents i go to!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on a whim, and it was a lovely little shop. A very nice younger guy greated me and took my order right away, and the food was very fresh, and prepared speedily. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Similar to Subway but SO MUCH BETTER. The staff is friendly and helpful, the bread is fresh and fluffy. And the fresh sliced meats and cheeses actually make the sandwich so much better. Never going to Subway again."}
{"text":"Thanks to this place I will never eat Jimmy Johns or Subway again!! Bread is soft, not dried out and meat is slice directly like a deli."}
{"text":"Staff was fantastic.  It was our first time in and they were incredibly friendly with a smart alec like attitude (in a funny way) and we loved it!  First timers get a free cookie!  The place was spotless... very very clean.  Loved that.  Now for the food... Hubby had a Hickory smoked turkey sandwich - cold sandwich... it was really good.  yummy chewy bread - very soft and fresh.  And mind you it was about 8pm at night.  I got a California Turkey Club - this is toasted...  I didnt know that when I ordered it but my bad for not paying attention to the menu board.  It was still very good but I liked the cold sandwich better... its all just a personal preference... hot or cold... they were both very tasty and all ingredients were fresh and delicious.  I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to eat here but it was a good sub."}
{"text":"I go there for lunch all the time. They have pretty tasty subs a pretty reasonable pricing and they are pretty quick with giving you your sub and getting you on the road for getting you fed."}
{"text":"Positively the worst sandwich delivery I've experienced. They have screwed up several times. They never deliver at time promised .  Either too early (future delivery order ) or too late (soggy sub sandwich and ice cold soup)."}
{"text":"The Turkey sub I ordered and received was good, however based on the horrible experience I had in there I have no plans in ever returning.  The employee that attended me on Wednesday the 22nd of April was on taking a personal call and holding a phone in one hand and my making my sub with the other. I was not able to tell him no mayo due to his lack of attention to the customer. Just figured I would inform my fellow yelpers that this is more of a carry out place than a dine in."}
{"text":"Okay, maybe more like 3.5. I used to love this place. Makes Subway taste like complete crap. Their sandwiches are still perfectly consistent here. The prices, well, they are higher than Subway now for a toasted 12\". The bread is very soft and delicious and I'm a sucker for their chocolate chip cookies.  All in all, not bad. For me, it's a toss up between here and Jimmy John's.  Here's a tip though: COME HERE ON SUNDAY! Two footlongs for $8.99 is damn hard to beat."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here about once a week and the sandwiches are fantastic! The bread is fresh as well as the meat and condiments. The people that work there are super nice and friendly. Today we catered it into the office to feed about 60 people and it was wonderful! This is the second time we've ordered for the office and everyone loves it. It's affordable, fresh and delicious. I love that they send little bottles of vinegar, oil, mustard and mayo. They also send separate trays of pickles, onions, jalapenos, etc. I highly recommend them!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  First, the staff is SOOOOOO nice. Secondly, the make their own bread fresh, slice their own meats and cheese right there! I have NEVER had an issue with food, the cleanliness of the restaurant or any service I've gotten here.  Check it out, WAY better than Subway."}
{"text":"Normally my boyfriend and I really love this place. We ordered delivery before work like we do frequently, and it was a little late which was no big deal. My issue is that I ordered banana peppers on my sandwich and got pickles instead. The peppers were mentioned twice on my order but the sandwich is totally void of peppers so I'm not sure how this happened. This wouldn't normally be a bug deal but I'm allergic to pickles and we didn't have time to either order a correction or go pick a new one up. We checked our order to make sure I didn't hit the wrong button on online ordering but I definitely selected banana peppers, and even requested light peppers in the comments so I'm not sure what happened. Just hoping their employees will pay a little closer attention in the future when making sandwiches so any serious allergy issues don't occur.   Besides this, their sandwiches truly are delicious and I recommend people give them a try."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff and the most amazing subs (: ive never had any bad experiences here and i come here often. I love it. Thank you."}
{"text":"I hit this place up from time to time when I am in a hurry and am not feeling to particular about lunch.   Its not bad. Not great, but not bad. They are generous with the veggies which I love and the bread is always good.  Only down side is that it could be cleaner."}
{"text":"Pathetic..closes on super bowl Sunday....what restaurant is closed on super bowl Sunday? That's the day you make the most money! I will never go to Goodcents again...I was a loyal customer till I wanted a sub on super bowl Sunday at 6pm...they were closed!! Never going againn to this location normally bad ingredients anyways but it's quick and easy...never again will I pay to eat here! Not customer friendly! Old ingredients!"}
{"text":"By far the best cold subs in the valley.  Such fresh bread, meats are incredible, and great service at this location.  They have a drive thru and deliver!"}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot because we liked their subs however I just can't get past the meat slicer not being clean. I always get the cheese mix sub and I find it gross that they slice my cheese on the same slicer that they slice the meat on so I end up with scraps of mystery meat stuck to my cheese. Yuck. Plus the slicer just looks dirty. We have started going to Jimmy Johns instead."}
{"text":"Never coming here again ! I ordered at 12:55 online and didn't receive my food until 1:45 . I was waiting at the store for 40 minutes"}
{"text":"Trying to decide where to pick up dinner for my family, I decided to try this place, based on the great Yelp reviews.   I went to their website, and placed my order to be picked up at 6 p.m.   I ALMOST chose to pay by credit card online, SO glad I chose 'cash' instead because when I GOT there at 6:00,...the store was full of workers who were completely REMODELING the store, and they looked at me like I was nutz.   Ended up going to Pong Pong chinese (also based on my Yelp research), had to wait a LONG time (since I didn't have time to pre-order it), but it was VERY good food.   I guess I'll have to wait to try Mr. Goodcents.  I wish they'd noted on their website that they'd be closed for remodeling."}
{"text":"Much better than Subway...especially the bread.  The employees are always great and accommodating.  This store is also a really big supporter of our community and they deserve our business because of it.   I just wish they had spinach as an alternative to lettuce."}
{"text":"Always wanted to stop by, and give them a try. Only thing that stopped me were some bad rumors of how clean they are? But then again, how clean is all the places we eat at?? So I had their 8\" Meat Ball sandwich, this was my second choice? I wanted was their cheese steak! But they were out of cheeses steak. But I do not regret their meat ball sandwich. It was very good, wish their bread would have been more toasted. But I thought it was good anyways. Place looks like and feels like a lot like Subway. But I do agree, they do add more meat to the sandwich. I will probably come back again."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for 10+ years and they used to be awesome. Recently (12/8/17), I encountered an employee who did nothing but complain about his tips, while making my sandwich. Well, I didn't leave him a tip and I let management know about this unprofessional encounter, within the survey I completed. No one followed up with me. A few days later, I found that the gentleman had taken it upon himself to add a $5 tip to my purchase and I called the GM (Alisa) right away. She assured me that she'd find the transaction, process my refund and contact me the next day. SIX days later, I called her again and she informed me that the employee had stolen money from more than 60+ customers and asked me to call the police with a case reference number, to give them my info. At first, she tried to offer me a gift card, as compensation. I told her I just wanted my money back and again, she ensured me that the owner (Veronica) would be calling me back the next day. That was two days ago. I have now wasted time on an online survey, 2 phone calls, a dispute with my bank and a Yelp review, over a two week time span. I can understand that there are bad people out there and an organization cannot be responsible for other people's actions all the time. BUT - That employee was representing Goodcents on that day, so it is Goodcents' responsibility to make this right. Follow-up and follow-through are the basics of a situation like this. My advice - Avoid this location. They are not properly running their business and lack the basic care for customer service."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy.    Great stop on our road trip.  The bread was excellent and all the toppings were equally fresh and delicious.  100xs better than Subway, Jersey Mikes, etc.  Prices were spot on too!!!  We will definitly stop here again on our way through."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place!! when I ordered my turkey sandwich, They put some MEAT on that thing!! not like other places that only give you 3 slices!! So I will definitely be going back there!!! Staff was also very friendly as well :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich shops, they cut the meat fresh and the bread is really good. Never tried their pasta though."}
{"text":"Reopened!!!  This location was a godsend when it first opened years ago. It's a little hard to get to now with all of the 303 / Greenway traffic. However now that it has reopened, we were super excited to go back!! If you haven't eaten here, give them a try. It's a nice break from Subway (who's becoming more and more over-priced!) and you'll be giving back to a local business owner - not a major chain. They give baxk to the community, so thats a major bonua right there!! I hope they can make it and stay open. Hopefully the local construction crews are dining there to keep them afloat until the 303 is complete!! That is their only downfall I see. Otherwise like I wrote before, check them out."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I love Mr. Goodcents Subs.  I just don't like this location.  Every time i have gotten a sandwich from this location there is almost no meat compared to the location next to ASU West.  Usually I get double meat because I am a big guy, and even then it is just a little sad.  Now I have never weighed it and compared it to the other location but it certainly seems like its a lot less.    Finally it drives me nuts that the people behind the counter don't know what a pepperchini is.  I ask if they have them and they say yes. Most of the time what they have is banana peppers but sometimes they actually had pepperchini's.  Never know what you will get but that just frustrated me.   I can say that the people that work here are really nice and that the restaurant is very clean and the food fresh.  But These little things just drive me crazy and i finally stopped eating there even though it was the closest restaurant to my house."}
{"text":"Their sign says the nicest place on earth or was it happiest....wait thats Disneyland. I think. Anyway, the folks behind the counter are very nice and helpful. I like that they have pasta here and the meat is sliced right in front of your eyes if your into that sort of thing. Everything always looks really fresh even today at 4 pm. I have been coming here forever and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing. Ordered food at 3:15, got it at 5. The manager refunded it which I appreciate but come on. Ordered a bacon ranch, no ranch on it. Talked this place up like crazy with my coworkers and we all ordered so that looked bad on me. One of them ordered elsewhere after an hour waiting and received their food before us. Frustrating."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery 3 times, since they opened. Each time it gets worse. They have No Idea What They are doing.  Save your money and your stomache!  Much Better places to eat. Staff is Shady! I agree with Marc R.!"}
{"text":"We had Goodcents Deli cater our recent party & we're very pleased with our experience! Jake took good care of us with his advice for our crowd, our two sandwich trays were ready as promised, along with a very nice variety relish tray, & a pack of condiment cute bottles on the side! The food was fresh & delicious and a big hit! We won't hesitate to go to Goodcents in the future, thanks Goodcents!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good deli. From what I could tell, there was nothing that separated it from other delis. Good though."}
{"text":"Despite not being much of a \"sandwich eater\", I've always been a fan of Goodcents. Not because I think they're sandwiches are any better than Quizno's or their decor any more aesthetically pleasing than Subway's, but because they're the most honest sub shop I've ever come across.  Even though sandwiches can be good for you, you don't see some asshole running around with a sandwich board that reads \"MR. GOODCENTS SUBS WILL MAKE YOU SKINNY! OH...AND THE END IS NEAR!\" And even though they cut their own meat, you don't hear them advertising this one particular aspect of their business at every opportunity.  OMG A FUCKING TOASTER? YOU CAN TOAST SUBS! OH MY GOD THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER? IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN USUAL SUB SHOPS BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE IT'S TOASTED, IT'S BETTER AND MORE FILLING! TOASTED'S THE WAY OF THE FUTURE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  They make sandwiches. That's really all there is to it.   They keep their bread in giant plastic bags because although it's unappetizing looking, it actually preserves the freshness, as opposed to keeping bread stored in a hot, humid cabinet just above the oven where it will begin to absorb the taste of the bread it's crammed up against (Yeah, I got your fucking number, Subway).   They cut their meat and cheese fresh because that's actually what you're supposed to do, rather than pre-slice it and pre-package it so it can stew in its own juices while it gets shipped out to the nearest chain location (My Ultimately Worthless Factoids-2, Subway-0).  They're subs might be healthy, but probably not. Judging by the large number of heavy-set people (including myself) who frequent Mr. Goodcents, I think it's safe to say that all that meat and cheese probably isn't doing our hearts any favors. But then again I know people who only order the salads at McDonald's or the veggie at Subway who'd make a dietitian piss themselves and faint.   The last couple of times I've been to Goodcents I admittedly had no interest in purchasing their sandwiches. The diuretics I'm on right now force everything out of me, so I've currently been on an all-soup diet. A bowl of ramen or a cup of Campbell's Soup At Hand contains both the water I need and the sodium to help me retain said water.   Goodcents has, for a sandwich shop, amazing soups and pastas. The chicken noodle itself is worth a visit or two, as is there chicken alfredo or pasta salad.   Plagued with the flu, I stumbled in last Wednesday with a few bucks in my pocket and a craving for something hot and liquid to sip slowly. While my friend was harassing one of the girls at the counter (what guy sees a girl putting meat through a cutter and goes \"yes, she seems like a suitable mate\"?), I gave another  my order.  \"Chiggen soup, please. A half.\" \"Just a half? Are you sure? You sound like you need it.\" \"Just a half's fine.\" \"Tough. I gave you a full. You sound sick.\" \"Oggay. Thagg you.\" \"You're a student, right? Show her (the cashier) your student ID and you'll get a free drink. You need all the fluids.\" \"Yeah. Tell me about it. Thagg you zo much.\" \"Don't mention it.\"  Later that day, while my co-workers were arguing Subway vs Quiznos and discussing what should and should not go on a meatball sub, I sat quietly, sipping at my chicken noodle soup and lemonade, thinking that I could get use to this 'flu' thing.  Oh, I couldn't fit this into a clever phrase but the soup comes with a side of buttery bread. It's amazing. You wouldn't think that buttery bread and chicken soup went together, but a few years ago you probably sat there in front of your TV and said \"Toasted subs? Yeah, that's a passing fancy if I ever saw it.\"  You know what I've been looking for? A deli that makes good PB&J sandwiches. Anyone who can bring me this information will be given my secret recipe for the ultimate bloody mary."}
{"text":"Like the food...despise the service. Been here 3 times in last few months...the staff is extreme rude. You've got the gauged gauge - less infected earlobe guy who doesn't want to open his mouth when he speaks. .. comes off as very uninterested and bothered when you say 'im sorry I can't hear you' sandwich then slides down to the butch girl who has major attitude...then finally rang up by the dark haired girl who appears high and had very bloodshot eyes. Def not the service we used to get when there was 'Mister' before the name. No longer being Family owned and different name/staff certainly sent this place to the toilet.  We are done eating here! Rudest staff I've ever came across.  Customer service is HUGE for me when it comes to shelling out money to feed a family of 7."}
{"text":"I quite enjoy this place.  It's nice to have the meat and cheese sliced in front of you.  Though it's a bit pricer than some of the other chain shops but it's well worth it.  The food has always been fresh and filling.  Their pasta is decent, but I prefer to stick with the subs.    The wait can be a bit long during peak hours, but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned this is the best corporate sandwich shop. If you've never been, when you order a sub they literally slice the meat in front you.. its more like a deli experience than a pre-weighed, pre-measured corporate chain. Their white bread is so soft and squishy and does a wonderful job of absorbing mayo, oil, vinegar.. this to me is what a sub should taste like.   Also, they are doing the $5 dollar sub deal here, any cold sub 5 bucks!!!"}
{"text":"Mr Goodcents is such a guilty pleasure if mine. I just love how squishy their white bread is! The bread pairs well with all of the deli meats they slice to order.   Simple, fresh and way tastier than many of the other chain (you know who you are) sub shops."}
{"text":"I love Mr. Goodcents. Friendly service and delicious food! I recommend the chicken bacon ranch on wheat!"}
{"text":"I was super impressed with this place. They cut the meat and cheese just for your order. It's not that meat that has been sitting out in a bin all day either. The 12 inch was enough food to fill me up and it tasted great.  I have found a new home to go get my subs."}
{"text":"Came in for the grand opening to the new Mr. Goodcents location that just opened on 32nd st and greenway with some buddies. As usual the the subs were great! But unfortunately an unfortunate event happened where my friend accidentally left his phone at the booth of where we were sitting.  He did not realize this til we got back to his house.  So he called the store and asked if anyone had seen/found an Iphone, he got a denial response back.  So we drove back to the store and he confronted in person asking politely to have a quick look through the store to find it.  They allowed him to do so. He still did not find it.  But the Iphone locating app that we pulled up on another phone indicated it was at this location, so the employee escorted him out and around into the back of the store to check near the dumpster in case it may have been thrown out.  Again nothing to be found.  So he did one last look through inside the store and still no phone.  So at this time he felt it's time to give up and politely said goodnight to the employees that were there closing up.  But still he was not satisfied, \"the Iphone locator doesn't lie\" he says.  So we all went to take one last look around and ended up in the back of the establishment and at the dumpster yet again and were digging through hitting the ping button on the lphone locating app and as we were digging we heard the loud ping of the phone and it was stashed nice and hidden in the slot of the dumpster.  Obviously, Mr. Goodcents didn't have the goodsense to hire trustworthy employees to treat a regular customer with the decency to be honest with him and return the phone to its rightful owner.  SMDH, shady employees equals bad business."}
{"text":"Great sub place that doesn't get old! I hadn't ate here in several years. Today, I happened to be in the area and figured I would stop in for lunch. To my surprise, the quality of the food hadn't changed. Still amazing subs and service. Small shop, nothing major, but they have perfected what they do. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food. But if you have a drive thru you should probably should have people there to take orders. I couldn't come inside bc I had my dog and say there. Even honked. Nothing. Very displeased bc we come here often."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mr Goodcents in town. The owner is a super nice guy and they make a mean sandwich. Can't go wrong when you are looking for a sandwich not looking for the fuss on arrowhead mall."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are always fresh and delicious. The service is always fast. Great place to get good sandwiches."}
{"text":"We both ordered sandwiched that had turkey on them. The turkey on both was cheap and slimy.... We had to throw them away. Cheap prices, but cheap ingredients... Pass."}
{"text":"I love this place - and I love the couple that owns it.  I just went back for the 1st time in a long while today, and they have the soda machine of the future!  It's silly I know, but it's a nice touch.  Their bread is always fresh, and their prices are reasonable (less than $6 for almost every footlong).  I stopped going when their corporate office stopped sending the pastrami - which was hands down my favorite sandwich at the time (consequently, albeit a sandwich they don't sell any more, they called the cold pastrami a \"Nuckolsandwich\" in honor of my last name).  Their roast beef, turkey, penny club & Italian sandos are bomb."}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered a chicken bacon club hot and an Italian sub cold. They were both deliciousness. We watched some sports on the TVs they have. Child friendly environment , polite staff. Recommend to anyone that need a nice sandwich for lunch. Cheers!"}
{"text":"What in tonight for dinner. I thought I would give them a second chance because the last time we went there it wasn't good. It used to be a really good place to eat but over the last two years it's really gone downhill. The service this evening was ridiculous nobody welcomed me nobody said goodbye to me. One girl rolled her eyes as she came up to make me a sandwich. Didn't give me a bag for my sandwiches only my pasta. Very unpleasant experience will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are so good and my daughter absolutely loves the rainbow bread! Such a cute idea for a kids meal! They are a tad slow in the delivery side but I think it's just because my address is not easily found through the maps app. Other then that I would totally recommend ordering from here!"}
{"text":"There are very few times where I actually app eating my food. But this is one of them. I ordered a 18\" tuna sub and my girlfriend a smaller veggie. The subs themselves looked pale and not fresh at all. The tuna had the weirdest taste. And by the way we ordered bottled soda but received canned! Does anyone think these are the same things?"}
{"text":"Not a bad sub. Tasty and substantial but with Blimpie and Port of Subs nearby those will be my go-tos before Goodcents, as those are similar enough, have better bread, better sandwich recipes, and meat that more distinguishable within the sandwich. The lack of those things was the shortcoming of Goodcents. Good (pardon the pun), not great."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!  It has ruined quite a few other sandwich places for me.  The bread is fantastic! I love the way that they slice the meat for you..makes it even more fresh!  The fact that they even have a new coke machine and GINGER ALE...yeah, it's amazeballs!"}
{"text":"I can't even imagine going to that \"green and gold\" place again!  Super friendly and absolutely delicious sandwiches!    I ordered a typical turkey sub with provolone and it was made to perfection.  The fact that they slice the deli meat to order was the kicker for me.  The bread is perfection...soft and has great flavor.    Do yourself a favor, have some good sense and head to Mr. Goodcents!"}
{"text":"Where to start?  Maybe it was the semi-literate, semi-intelligible order taker with enough crap hanging off his face to set off a metal detector three states away.    Then a sandwich with something resembling Cheddar, albeit from another dimension.  A Coke Freestyle with 3/4ths of the options out.  Or the filthy dirty dining room, replete with dirty footprints near the condiments station.  I'd rather eat sushi in Mogadishu compared to this place."}
{"text":"The new remodel their looks really good. They have added a couple TVs that blast CNN all day. The stop is always friendly and smiling. They have 1 of those awesome New Coke machines with all the flavors. They have daily specials every day, which is a huge plus when you're on a budget. My baby loves their chicken. in my opinion the beat the pants off subway."}
{"text":"Little disappointed it says 20 Oz. Bottles on line and I recieved a 12 Oz. Can and was told they need to.change website....really...very disappointed"}
{"text":"Yum.  I got a ham and pepperjack cheese sandwich on white.  Very good!  I like that the meat/cheese isn't sliced ahead of te, but right in front of my eyes.  Nice and fresh."}
{"text":"I love mr goodcents. The bread is great and they have a large selection. Bonus is they deliver just seem to have computer problems a lot"}
{"text":"good food, fresh sliced meats and cheese, fresh bread, good people, great prices and the cheddar broccoli soup is great. a great value for what you get, maybe the best value for none fried food anywhere"}
{"text":"Have not been to a location since the Tempe and still nothing has changed . Delicious and fresh meats and veggies . Also like the 10% off for ordering online . Will be back as my first choice of subs !"}
{"text":"I am a sandwich girl, I love a good sandwich, and since my office moved I have 3 sandwich shops just inches away from me on opposite corners of each other, Subway, Jimmy Johns and Mr Goodcents Subs, so I decided to give Mr Goodcents a try.  1st thing I noticed right off the bat, they slice the meat in front of you, I think that's pretty neat. I ordered the penny club, its ham, turkey & roast beef with provolone cheese and all the veggies and I have to say, this was a great sandwich, the bread is fresh and soft everything was just perfect!   Mr Goodcents glad I found you! Don't tell Jimmy John when I come over though,,,,,,,,"}
{"text":"Our goto for subs in surprise, unlike subway they actually have the meat slicer right behind the counter and slice the meat fresh before your eyes, they have a variety of bread choices and do both cold and hot subs, they offer four different sizes I believe the largest is 16\" I usually eat half and take the other half to work the next day. they also have fresh baked brownies and cookies (you can tell because they're different shapes and wrapped in celophane instead of vacuum seal)  But the best part \"THEY DELIVER\" I don't think people use this service a lot because when you call they act like they've never delivered a sub before, but for a few dollars extra you can actually have something other than pizza or chinese delivered to your door.  my goto for a cold sub in surprise"}
{"text":"Mr Goocents has the best bread, so they make the best sub.  That's my take, after more than a decade of trying all the sub shops around.  I am also a big fan of their soups, which are usually broccoli cheddar (my 4-year old's favorite) and chicken noodle (my favorite).  They also stock Sun Chips (bonus) and have the cool soda machine where you can make any soda any flavor... grape Sprite?  No problem?    What's not to love?  They're cheap, they're easy and they're good.  :-)  See ya there!"}
{"text":"We love us some Mr. Goodcents!  Everyone who works there is incredibly friendly and welcoming.  I am obsessed with the razor-thin onions they put on the sandwiches. Everything is cut fresh and to order.  Unlike Subway, their bread tastes freshly baked and is very soft.  If we have a hankering for a sub, you better believe we'll be heading for this place!"}
{"text":"The bread here is delicious and the veggies are fresh not mushy.   I have no idea why people go to that other sub shop . The daily deals are great and were always satisfied."}
{"text":"The sell tasty sandwiches at this place. I like how they freshly slice their meat & cheese. I like the turkey pepperoni with mozzarella on wheat.   The price is similar to other sandwich places except this place offers a punch card  to earn free sandwiches! Today the told me to pick a winning Wednesday card, I won a free bag if chips for my next visit."}
{"text":"Do not order here if you need a party tray...unless you want to be late to the party.  I ordered a couple trays 24 hours in advance only to show up at the chosen pickup time to no trays ready and be told it will be about 10 minute okay no problem ..things happen. Meanwhile 1 of the 2 employees stops to call a delivery customer to tell them they will be late.  Hello maybe the same courtesy to your pickup customers as well that spent 80 dollars  instead of waiting 45 minutes in the store for it.  How about maybe offering your waiting customers a water or fountain drink while they are stuck waiting unexpectanly? No that would actually show you appreciate your paying customers.  Finally get the sub trays and one of them is all in some garlic spicy bread that is honestly pretty much inedible and not mentioned as part of the order. Stay clear of this place!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best quick subs shop I've been to.  not the best hot subs, but everything cold cut is fresh and delicious.  They have a garlic pepper bread that is super good and a must try.  Everything we go in to the shop the workers are friendly and even with a one it goes by quick.  I would recommend this place if you want a cold cut fresh sub sandwich.  If you're looking for hot subs or pasta, might want to try something else.  The pasta is decent for kids, but it's definitely not a reason to go there.  I've also had the meatball sub and it's just okay.  The deliver which is wonderful and also have an app for ordering.  I have nothing bad to say about this place, really."}
{"text":"Cheese mix, delicious love of mine.  Yep, they offer all five of their cheeses as the 'protein' for your yummy little submarine sandwich. Pretty friggin' amazing.  The service at this location can be hit or miss- but for all that ridiculous cheese, I can deal with it."}
{"text":"I likes me a good deli fresh sub, but I gotta ask when the hell did sandwiches get so bloody expensive?  The food is easily 4-stars, but what is with the prices, guys? You didn't put that much on the bread either, I watched you do it. Four slices of meat, exactly 3 tomato slices...on an extra long sub?  The staff was friendly though, so I come to an average of 3 stars for this place."}
{"text":"Awesome subs and good prices. Everything was so tasty and fresh. I love the size choices and that they fresh cut the meat when ordered."}
{"text":"I must like this place.   Turns out, I eat here a lot.  They make a great sub for the price.   I started out with the oven Roasted Chicken sub but lately i've been ordering the spicy Ham with Pepper Jack and Jalapenos.   Its the right amount of food for lunch and you don't end up wanting a nap at 2pm when you have crap to do.     Great job!   The bread is fresh and you don't open it up and see yesterdays lettuce staring back at you.   Plus they're pretty delicious.     I'll be back."}
{"text":"Last time going there was a disappointment. It looks like they are cutting back on the meat slicing on the sandwich. 1 2 3 pieces of meat then move on to the condiments. If I'm going to pay for an$ 8.00 sandwich...WERE'S THE BEEF? Sorry Larry your a great guy, but give them a sandwich to come back for."}
{"text":"Great good, great services, and great prices. I have used these guys for catering and they provide great service and good time after time!"}
{"text":"Always go with the daily special here. The magnet and team are great!! Always get great service! Even today the manager upgraded out drink size \"because we were so great.\" I really enjoy management treating their customers.  Their need is fresh and soft, meat tastes and is deli fresh. When in have a sun from here I can taste and see the difference between goodcents and subway. More meat. More veggies and less bread."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today. Very friendly service and fresh products. I had an issue with my debit card and was offered my food for free. I was able to reach the bank and resolve the issue to pay for the food, but I was very impressed that they were so understanding. As far as the sandwich,  it was very good. I don't think I'll be eating at Subway anymore. They slice the meats and cheeses to order which I was very impressed with"}
{"text":"The penny is where its at, the food here is quickly made and 10 times better than subway. The garlic bread is an awesome addition, I just wish they would stay open as long as silver mine subs did! But they went out of business, so that could be the reason..."}
{"text":"This sub shop is right around the corner from where I live, so I manage to stop by often. My husband and I always get the same thing....the tuna sub on wheat. One of these days we have to branch out, but the tuna is really good. And they have LOTS of optional veggies for the sandwiches that we love. Friendly staff too! And they have a frequent users club so eventually you get your sub for free. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"My 1st time here and it definitely won't be my last!  Super convenient location right off Bell and 91st near the 101.  Tons of ample parking.  Super clean and lots of seating to stretch your legs or chill out after a tough day at work like I did.  I don't think it's any secret that I'm somewhat of a sandwich fiend.  I'm hell bent on trying all of them.  And people are, like, you mean all of them in Peoria?  All of them in the Valley?  All of them in Arizona?  No.  I mean, ALLLLLLLL of them.  So I opted for the Goodcents Original which is freshly-sliced ham, bologna, salami and pepperoni.  The meat really is freshly-sliced.  I mean, they do it right before your very eyes.  In other words, it's not sitting in a cold deli case or kicking back at room temperature in some black plastic cases behind a glass counter.  It's freshly-sliced.  In addition to all of that fresh cut meat, they layered thin sliced cheddar cheese on top of the meat.  From there, I piled on a ton of fresh veggies in addition to a little yellow mustard.  All of those ingredients were piled on some fresh wheat bread and I do mean, fresh.  I mean, the bread was soft was a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie.    I think as my fellow Yelp'ers mentioned for a quick, fresh sub shop - it's tough to beat Goodcents.  As I mentioned earlier, it was my first time eating here and it most definitely won't be my last.   Delicious!"}
{"text":"Fast service and great sandwiches. The bread and quick service is really what sets this place apart from other sandwich shops. My fiancé and I go here several times a week for lunch and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place because all the ingredients are fresh and the bread is delicious. It's my new favorite sub place!! Recommended to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it's goodcents or Mr Good Cents, but the sign says \"Goodcents\" so I'm hoping this is the right place. Anyways, here's my review:  This place easily earned a five star for several reasons:  1. They used fresh ingredients. They cut the meat and cheese right in front of me and I saw the lady take out the bad looking tomatoes from the tray before finding ones good enough to put on my sandwich. They didn't even look bad to me, but I appreciate it nonetheless.   2. Every one of the people behind the bar smiled at me and looked me in the eye. Gave me recommendations. Good customer service. Hell, one of the ladies came around and picked up our trays for us.   3. The price was comparable to other deli shops and similar to a certain sandwich chain, but slightly tastier.   Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Mr Goodcents.  Yum.  This place is located very close to me.  I used to visit the one on Broadway, but this location is much better. Very clean, friendly atmosphere, fast, good food.  The $5 footlongs can't be beat. They even have \"club\" cards so you can get a free sandwich after so many purchases.  I've never had a bad experience here, either with the service or the food.  If you're looking for something good and fast and don't want to settle for the typical fast food fare, give this place a try.   Oh and they do have pasta, but I've never tried it. The subs are too good!"}
{"text":"The subs are fantastic but the customer service is even better. The employees are always friendly and happy to accommodate. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the food here but the service sucks.  Evidently it doesn't pay to PLAN AHEAD and place your order online AND PAY IN ADVANCE.  My order wasn't ready when I got there, so I got to sit and wait while 6 or 7 people that walked in off the street were helped.  I would have been better off not placing my order online.  They couldn't have cared less...they already had my money so why should they??  They couldn't have been less interested.    I order from here at least 4 times a month. I'll never go back.  Shame on me for planning ahead.    10/09/17 Update-I went to the store again at my husband's request and it was the same group of people only this time they were helpful and friendly.  It's just hit or miss here I guess. At least the food is good enough to keep people coming back."}
{"text":"Good Cents is now our go to Sandwich place in Surprise. The bread is great and meats are sliced fresh and melt in your mouth. We generally get an 18\" Ultimate Club and split it. Whoa! That's a tasty sub. We've tried jimmy johns, subway, and Lucky's in the area and none compare to quality of Good Cents. Also we love being able to order and pay online and just pickup."}
{"text":"I recently changed offices and this Mr. Goodcents is near my work. Though we have a cafeteria onsite, my workplace is a lot like a casino (in that the clocks are hidden and sunlight is forbidden) and I often find myself here for lunch and a some vitamin D.  I immediately liked this place and find myself here at least once a week (and I am pretty sure it is more about the food than my casino-office) for lunch. I tend to get a 6 inch Italian on white with standard dress minus oil and add mustard and pepperoncini. Sometimes I mix it up and put it on wheat, because I am just crazy like that. They also have one of those coke machines that will create a million different flavors. These Coke machines are not my favorite because they are slow and can create a line. Then again, I am a wild man with the wheat bread so my preference in coke machines may be an outlier.    The restaurant is often busy at lunch, though they move the line quickly and I typically do not have to wait more than 5 minutes. I have been impressed that they greet every guest every time I am there. The lunch meat is fresh, and they post a \"standard dressing\" for sandwiches that saves time and keeps the line moving. You do not have to use the \"standard dressing\" but I think most people do and it saves calling out each ingredient in line.   Their bread is always fresh and they cut the meat and cheese as they make your sandwich. I also like that you can order a sandwich in almost any two inch increment starting at 4 inches (4\", 6\", 8\", etc...).   Mr. Good Cents also delivers and, when I worked in a non-casino, I had their delivery several times. Because their menu is clear and they are precise in the questions they ask on the phone, my delivery and take out have always been just right."}
{"text":"Had this place for the first time a few months nack, my roommates suggested it to me as I'm a usual fan of subway but wanted to try something different. I got the Buffalo chicken sandwich with ranch and it was amazing! Price was very reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"This is the forth and best Mr. Goodcents that I routinely eat at. It is by far the cleanest of the bunch (Clean like \"very clean\",\"my 1 year old son eats right off the table kinda clean\") The others were all closed down over time, I'll miss them but this one is my favorite.  The meat and the condiments are always fresh and the bread is so good.  My Favorites are The original. The roast beef, the Italian and the turkey. Usually with onion, olive, mayo, o/v. On the original it has to be mustard and mayo with pickles. My wife got me stuck on that combo 7 years ago, and I get it the same every time.  Never had a bad experience here.  Who knows, maybe I'll go there tonight? ha ha."}
{"text":"I went in today to grab a sandwich after my errand at the Walgreens next door.  There was a line of about 6 or so ahead of me.  Fine.  I was behind the couple paying and they paid with cash.  The young gal took their money and gave them change wearing the same gloves she just used to put on condiments on their sandwiches.  Then she went back to her station and proceeded to dress more sandwiches wearing the same gloves.  She did not change her gloves.  I will never go back no matter how good the sandwiches are.  And I did tell the person that rang me up what I witnessed.  Didn't even phase her.  I am shocked they are still in business."}
{"text":"I only like to review places that are either really good or really bad and I'm happy to say this one is really good.  I've been to many of the Mr. Goodcent's locations around the valley and this one always seems to be the best.  It's the cleanest and always has friendly employees.  Even though I don't really like chain restaurants, this is a franchise that appears to be owned by a couple so I like being able to support a local business/family.   There isn't anything fancy about them but I like their large selections of veggies and dressings.  Today I overheard an employee telling one of the owners that they finished making the spicy ranch and I was pleased to see they made it and didn't buy it.  The bread is super fresh and yummy, which is probably the best part!!!      I got a 12\" cheese and veggie sub and a medium drink for the same cost as a 12\" sub and drink from Subway.  This tasted a lot fresher and was so much better!  Not sure why some reviews said they are more expensive than Subway.    BTW- they give punch cards so for every 9 (or is it 10?) sandwiches you buy, you get one free.  Maybe not a big deal but when you eat sandwiches often, it's a nice little bonus to get rewarded for loyalty."}
{"text":"There subs are the best. I was never a sub fan until I tried goodcents! The meat and cheese is really tasty and so is the garlic pepper bread!  The staff is always friendly and make the subs just the way we want!"}
{"text":"I was checking out local places the other day and noticed a sandwich shop right off the Loop 303 and Greenway Rd, I didn't pay it much attention just thought I'd need to stop in and give it a try since its so close to my house. Well I stopped in and got some sandwiches while unpacking. I was pleasantly surprised it was a Goodcents. I have had Goodcents before when I lived in Kansas. They must have had 4 or 5 people working behind the counter, one taking the order and getting the bread ready, while another was slicing the meats for each sandwich while its being ordered. Another person to finish the sandwich and yet another to get you anything else and ring it up. I think they even had a few other people working on special or phone orders and. Needless to say the bread was fresh, the meats were great and the veggies were good. I asked about avocado or guacamole which they were offering but it was on a small sign, not on the sign for other toppings, so when I was finishing my sandwiches I forgot to request it be added. Maybe they will see this and put it on the list with a charge next to it, because that's what I was looking at when having my sandwich finished. Also I don't remember seeing bacon as a choice either. But still a good sandwich. I would recommend this place to my friends and family for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Goodcents! Everything is so fresh and delicious. The meat doesn't taste dry or oily, and the veggies also taste fresh, unlike some other sub chains (not to mention they slice the meat in front of you).  I just had some remains of a catering platter (from about 4 hours ago), and the sandwiches still tasted fresh and successfully satisfied my Goodcents craving. If you think Subway is good (bleh), then you will definitely fall in love with Mr Goodcents!"}
{"text":"First time ever ordering from this place, and it was amazing! This beats Jimmy Johns and Subway by a long shot. I got it delivered, and it showed up 5 minutes earlier than expected. The man who delivered it was so sweet as well! 10/10 recommend and I will for sure be a new regular."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the sandwiches here are always great. The bread tastes fresh and they are pretty quick getting me in and out of the door. Today was sub par if that with the customer service. The second we walked in it was like gloom and doom took over the building. The girl asked us what we wanted, but her facial expression and demeanor was more like we ruined her day coming in. Everyone has an off day I get that, but after putting the beginnings of our sandwich together she disappeared and left it to another girl to take over and finish. The place was clean and we were back in the car on the way home under 10 minutes. I did notice today that they deliver. I had no idea until I saw the sign on their door today. Next time I order I will give it a try."}
{"text":"Subs are great, delivery not so much. I don't understand how 2 subs can take 1 hour 15 minutes to arrive."}
{"text":"I like their subs. It sometimes the wait is a bit much. Prices are on the high end of the sub sandwich world."}
{"text":"One star. I went this past Monday during lunch and I was the only person there when I walked in. I ordered two toasted subs and someone walked in behind me and ordered two cold subs. While my subs were fresh out the oven, the guy just kept making the other person's cold subs, finished them, rang them up, got their drinks and wished them a great day. By that time i was heated because my toasted subs were likely cold. I kind of wish he would've walked them to their car to be honest at this point. Anyway.. once it was my turn again they now had a line so sped through my sandwich and rushed me out. I really wanted to disregard my experience in the restaurant but to be completely honest, my sandwich was not very good. I ordered the turkey bacon ranch and also a chipotle cheesesteak... both were pretty bad. The one good thing I can honestly mention was the coke machine. Although the coke machine was awesome, it won't bring me back in."}
{"text":"This place has some of the highest quality meat I've ever had on a sandwich. They are competitively priced. Their bread is delicious. They have the touch screen soda fountain that lets you make custom drinks. They have TVs on ESPN usually which is a bonus for someone who likes sports. The staff seems friendly. Why go to subway and pay the same price for an inferior sandwich?"}
{"text":"coming from NY.. this place is really nothing but a subway sub with the name Mr Goodcents on the front of the building.. Nothing special at all.."}
{"text":"We've gone to this Goodcents for almost 8 years now I think? I think it's been open since we moved to Surprise? But anyways! We've been going here for a long time and we love it! We've never had any issues and we love the freshness of the bread!"}
{"text":"Surprised this place is still open. Sandwiches are mehh here and the manager is always super stressed and hurrying you, the few times I've ordered delivery its been sloppy. Nothing like what I grew used to at the union hills location"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Not only have the lost yet another order, they decided to not make it. 90 minutes after placing the order I called to check status, and was told the manager left with it 30 minutes ago and should be there. Then Summer called back to advise that the printer was not working AGAIN and my order was never made. This has happened to us several times! She then proceeded to tell me that the manager would refund my money, still has not happened. She also advised that the next time we order (mind you we order from there at least twice a week or more) they would do something.. Didn't do a bit of good the last time they screwed up order... I called back to speak to the manager, she should have been the one on the line apologizing, not the normal delivery lady.I was told she took other orders out and would get to my refund later. So not only have I been charged a lunch I DID NOT GET, SHE IS TAKING OTHERS THEIR LUNCH.   If yelp would allow I would give negative ratings. This is beyond acceptable. My card was charged the moment I placed the order, I had not called, I would still be sitting here waiting. Now I am left without a lunch and out $12.59... Such a load of crap!"}
{"text":"Nothing to the subs in the way of cheese! Paper thin! Even with their \"Cheese Mix\" sub... it's all bread! Subway here I come!"}
{"text":"Best subs in the valley. They have daily specials that vary from scratch and win tickets to 12\" sub deals. Pro-tip: order the garlic pepper bread, it won't do you wrong!"}
{"text":"Hellllloooooo Goodcents!  Where have you been all our lives?  When we saw your new location, just down the road from our house, we got soooooo excited! My husband absolutely LOVES your Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo and our visit yesterday did not disappoint!  The sauce was creamy, the noodles al dente, the chicken cooked to perfection.  I had to steal a bite from my husband and it was fabulous.  The garlic bread it came with was good too.  I ordered the Chipotle Cheesesteak (beef) with extra meat and it was huge.  I got it without the ranch so it was basically like a regular Philly cheesesteak.  Steak, onions, green peppers and extra cheese for me.  Yum!  It ate it in two sittings.  I love toasted subs and this one didn't disappoint.  I also tried their broccoli cheese soup and it is wonderfully creamy and cheesey.  We also got a ham and swim with onions and mayo for my mother.  She said it was super tasty and they even toasted it for her.  They have one of those cool Coke machines with all the different choices, regular and no/low cal.  A big win for me!  They have beverages for kids too, chocolate milk, apple juice, etc.  Something for everyone.  We ordered using the app with an awesome promo they have running now and the app was so easy to use.  You get to choose the pick up time and our food was ready to go right on time.  The employees at this location were super helpful and all so nice.  They have nice, comfy tables and seats.  Definitely a nice spot for lunch or dinner.  This location even has a drive thru and they deliver!!!!  Woo hoo!  I  We are so glad to have you Goodcents.  So much more fresh and exciting compared to the other chain sub shops around. We can't wait to come back and try other sandwiches.  Five stars,"}
{"text":"I like the subs here... way better than Subway. I like it better than Jimmy johns too.... and I believe its because I like the bread here better. For me, the bread can either make or break a sub sandwich. The bread here is on the softer, less dense side... which is what I like. The sub sandwiches are also fresh and they make it in front of you. The only negative thing I can say is the service. The people who work here seem like they are in jail to get punished or something."}
{"text":"There's a Subway across the street, but after discovering this place, I will never go back to that Subway.  They have high-quality, fresh, and sliced-in-front-of-you food.  Prices are slightly lower than Subway."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best sub shop around. Forget the place that Jarod went to... Better bread fresh sliced meats and cheese instead of preportioned paper wrapped meats & ingredients. They have a savers program and daily specials and that makes it a regular place for us."}
{"text":"I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town.  I have no idea why people go to Subway.  Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it.  Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for.    The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working.  $5 footlongs are there too - only they taste 20x's better!  They're all over the city if this one isn't in your neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Woohoo! A brand new Mr. Goodcent's opens in Temper after the one down on Broadway closes. I can finally get my delicious Italian subs again! The owners are a couple of real nice folks. Very clean. Overall, just peachy."}
{"text":"Tried them by calling in an order. The sandwich I got was a cheese steak. It seemed really small, and I ordered the biggest size they offered. Barely any cheese. The bell peppers were scarce, and when I got the sandwich it was barely warm, bland, and dry. The delivery guy called me to say he was here, and didn't even get out the car to give me my food. At the end of this,  I paid $10 to feel starved. The overpriced vending machines at work has better sandwiches than this, and they're cheaper."}
{"text":"What like about this place is the service.  Cold cut meats sliced as you order your sandwich and it goes right on your choice of bread.  The guy doing the slicing had an awesome customer service attitude; totally aggresive but also friendly.  The sandwiches were good.  If you need a quick bite for lunch I would say Mr. Goodcents is the way to go.  Don't expect anything too extravagant, its a sandwich...."}
{"text":"You would think in this shopping center that Mr Goodcents wouldn't have a chance. This shopping center is where businesses go to die. However, Mr Goodcents has stood the test of time and thankfully they are still there! The staff is super friendly and the same guys have been there for a while so the turn over rate can't be too high. The sandwiches are always fresh and I never have to wait long. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Just showed up at 7pm and they're closed!  On door says 730pm.. Other disappointed customers in parking lot too...  My first time going and now my last time."}
{"text":"Meh. .... I remember loving this place as a kid down in tucson when it was Mr goodcents.  Now, not so much.  Bread was awesome,  everything else was garbage.   Toppings were terrible.   Couldn't eat the onions because they were so old.   Service was horrible as well.   It would have been nice if they payed more attention to there customers rather then worrying and verbalizing how they couldn't get anything done."}
{"text":"We have been in this place off and on for the past 10 yrs, no problems, ever when you go there, great everything. Order delivery, totally different story. Out of the last dozen times, our order has been messed up 11 times, no lie! Tonight, we request pretty much, same order we always call in, 2 16 inch subs, 1 12. We received 1 12, 2 6\"...none were right, my son calls, talked to Brandon, the manager, rude, threatened my son, my husband got on the phone, he laughed at his complaints...NEVER WILL WE GO HERE AGAIN, EVER!!! My husband called corporate, got voicemail, we will see if they have better customer service...totally unacceptable. Don't order delivery from this place,  you have good luck doing that, good for you, us..not so much."}
{"text":"Good cents is good so I'm usually happy with my order, however I have had a few instances where they either forgot the mayo, or they used spicy ranch instead of spicy mustard, I am sure I do not have to tell you how this can change the entire flavor of your sandwich. I still like the place, I've just learned to not order ahead, and definitely never order delivery, I'd rather have eyes on my sandwich throughout the entire process."}
{"text":"This was my first , and last order from goodcents !!!  I ordered double meat , wasnt double. Ordered 8\" sub , was barely 6\". And a bag if chips , all for $13.00 . Sandwich was warm , not even chilled at all.   Never again !!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Alfredo with Chicken and got no chicken in my pasta. I would think if it's $2.00 more for chicken, they would put it in there. I most likely won't be back. Pasta wasn't good enough for me to return. If I do, maybe I'll try a sub."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh. I would recommend these subs over Subway or Quiznos. The only con i see is the size of their bread. Yes, you may get a 6 inch, 8 inch or 12 inch sub, however their bread is thin both in thickness and width. The sub's don't fall apart necessarily, but they aren't as filling, meaning they are very light, and better as a lunch time meal rather than dinner.  Other than that, they are clean, fair priced, and i like their specials for every day of the week."}
{"text":"Amazing Sandwiches!!! The meatball on garlic was fantastic! You can tell as soon as you walk in you're going to get a fresh sandwich, unlike when you walk into a Subway.  Very friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"I could eat subs for lunch every single day and never tire of subs.  Usually I go to subway because of location and price, but when I want a real treat I order Mr Goodcents.  I order the same thing every single time and consistently it is delicious.  The delivery driver is so professional and she is a sweetheart.  When I am feeling extra crazy I order chocolate chip giant cookie.  All very delicious!! Not the cheapest but definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Friendliest sub shop in the city. The food is amazing. You have got to try the chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"This location is always trying to appear uninviting..has all the chairs up on tables  at 745. Don't dare say your eating in, you get the look. Was told no more pasta preparations after 730 so the dish I drove over for was unavailable. Settled for a sub, wasn't great. The condiments were down to bare bones. Sad brown lettuce, tomato and olive, purple onion. The rest of containers were empty. We ended up calling thunderbird location and they gladly fixed my pasta at 815..no chairs up on tables and all fixings out. Smiling staff. We have a new location! Anyway the 19th union used to be a dentist office..feels a little icky to think teeth were cleaned and now food is prepped in same building. Kept biting tongue every time husband chose this location. Yuck"}
{"text":"Don't know what happened! Usually love that location but today I went in and the restaurant had a VERY BAD smell.  Got my food to go and got home and took a bite and it tasted JUST like the smell in the restaurant.. Threw it away.. Will definitely try again but if the restaurant smells the same I'm turning my ass around and going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Good cents still is awesome. Colton & Conner give great customer service! The quality of meat and bread stay superior. What else can I say?! I love good cents and wish more around the valley were open"}
{"text":"I would pick this place over subway.  The bread was soft and fresh with a great assortment of vegetables and condiments.  The service was fast and friendly.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Went there for the Grand Opening. Food was great and they have a good menu. It is nice to have a new place in the area. I will be back on my lunch breaks for sure to try some of the other items on the menu.   I read the reviews about the phone incident. Sucks that this place suffers in rating because someone has his friends post bad reviews because he left his phone there. There were a lot of people there that day, myself included. It could have been anyone, including a customer that threw the phone away. So blaming the staff and calling them shady is unfair. In the end, he found his phone and hopefully will be more responsible in the future so he doesn't have to blame someone else for it being lost.  Don't let that isolate incident deter you from thier great food. (No I don't work there nor do I know them, i am just a local business owner myself that hates seeing businesses bashed for reasons beyond their control)"}
{"text":"Update: My husband spoke with the owner this evening after he had reached out to us through email and cellphone. They had a good and lengthy conversation about all that occured. :) A full refund was given and, if we would consider trying them again, he would give us a party tray the next time we would like one. Both were mutualy disappointed that the situation had esculated so far when it was a simple fix. We appreciate and thank you Mr. Brady for taking the time out to address our concerns and provide a resolution."}
{"text":"Solid chain sandwich shop. Very helpful and friendly staff, and a simple enough menu. One simple order to get all the fixings instead of going through each thing in the line. Very enjoyable experience and a clean restaurant. Looks like the daily specials are the way to go here and they do large party catering."}
{"text":"I love that they deliver! The sandwiches are so delicious and each employee who has delivered to us have been friendly and the orders are always correct. It's so convenient to order online too."}
{"text":"Mr. Goodcents is my all time favorite place to get a sub. This location does not disappoint! The workers are always very friendly and courteous. The subs are such a great value for the quality that you get - fresh, soft bread, meats and cheese that is sliced right in front of you...my mouth is watering as I type!"}
{"text":"Wow! I will never go to Subway ever again. We've been on a Jersey Mike's kick but thought we would try out Mr. Goodcents since it's pretty close to home. When I arrived, the staff was very helpful in letting me know about their sizes, etc. since I had never been there before.   We ended up getting a turkey sandwich and a cheesesteak. I was dying to try the pasta but that will be next time. The sandwiches were amazing; the meat was fabulous quality (sliced right there in the store!), the bread was soft and warm...they were very literally the perfect subs.  The great service coupled with the awesome food, and at a VERY reasonable price earn this restaurant 5 stars. Love it!"}
{"text":"When comparing this place to other sandwich shops.....Mr Goodcents is in a league of its own. I crave this place on a daily basis. I am hooked on the Penny Club."}
{"text":"I had the smoked turkey on wheat and delish!  This place makes an amazing sub. Nothing fancy, they just know how to proportion the toppings, the bread is delicious and everything is fresh. I love vinegar and oil on my subs but often places put too much or too little, they get it just right here.  Puts the other places to shame. The prices are reasonable and it makes it a great work lunch spot. The delivery is fast too."}
{"text":"Penny club is my favorite. One person already wrote their sandwiches are better than Subway, and I agree 1000 percent. The parmesan bread is amazing....you can actually taste the cheese in it!"}
{"text":"Mr. Goodcents is a great alternative to Subway.  They have more ingredient options and a few locations around the valley.    I ordered the Italian sub with Capicola, Pepperoni, and Salami.  They have Asiago bread so I got it on that.  The vegetables are very fresh and the sandwich was great.    For the $5 footlong lovers they have 8 subs on that menu and if you want a different one it's only .49 extra.  They also have many sub size even 8 inch so if 6 is too small but 12 is too large have an option.    If you've never been check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sub I've ever had. Super fresh meat, cheese, and the softest fresh baked sub roll. Great customer service as well!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. It was my first time here and they were so friendly and kind. They were busy helping customers at the drive thru and I told the gentleman that I would wait and he looked at me and smiled and said \"no way, I can multitask\". I thought both the gentleman, Andre, and Jeanie there were so sweet and all smiles. He told me that their bread and cookies were bakes fresh, plus they slice the meat right in front of you. I would have a hard time going to Subway again after this amazing experience with customer service and incredible food!! Thank you for making my lunch break from my new job stress free and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the cheese steak sub here! I'm sure they have better items!  Man I don't even know where to begin. 1st off, I'm on a cheesesteak mission here in Surprise, AZ. I have only been to one other place and that was Jersey Mike's. They would have been a 5 star if they would put the right amount of steak and cheese on their sub, but alas, that was not the case. Now to the review of Goodcents in Surprise, AZ. Pictures speak louder than words, where is the cheese? After biting in the sandwich, I did find that they put it on the bottom. Maybe that is a new way of melting the cheese? Presentation of the sub suffered. One of the problems I had was that I ordered extra cheese, didn't want to fall into the jersey trap again (see review of Jersey Mikes from me) I did not get extra cheese. The steak amount was what I was looking for even though I did order my sub with extra meat. The issue with the meat is that it was very bland. The bacon I added to the sub did help mask the flavor, but just barely. That is why I have to give this a pass, don't order turn around and walk away! Only if you are in the mood for a cheesesteak sandwich. It will not be found here. I really need to stop watching the food network and the travel channel! That's why the hunt for a cheesesteak here in surprise. I ordered online and the sub was to be ready at 2:45pm. I arrived at the shop at 2:44pm and there was a line of about 10 people. There is no signage to indicate online pick up orders. I got my order at 2:51pm. Serious operations issue at this location. No smile or thank you, just sign this (my online receipt) and that was it. I'm beginning to think that customer service is slowly fading away....... Bye, bye customer service, you will surely be missed at this location. \"sniff\""}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I loved it. The first thing I noticed was how clean it was. I had my 4 young children with me and the GM Anthony was so polite and friendly with us. The sub was also so delicious and the bread was so soft. Keep up the great work there guys, you just got a returning customer!!!"}
{"text":"They usually have a daily deal I think every location may be different because they are privately owned but u can download the app to get rewards which is always great when a company offers incentives to enjoy the food they offer I love the garlic pepper bread and cookies bread is always soft fresh sliced meat"}
{"text":"They called this place a Subway-killer. They were right. Oh-so-right.  Mind you, I haven't been the biggest Subway fan. I'm actually more of a Quiznos fan. Subway's meat and ingredients, while supposedly fresh, never really tasted that great. Quiznos tasted far better, especially with their sauces.  Then comes this place... A Subway-killer? Intriguing. Even if I'm not the biggest Subway fan, I do know enough people depend on Subway that calling something a Subway-killer is a big deal.  Their bread. THEIR BREAD. My goodness their bread is so soft and delicious! I know it's odd to just point out their bread... There are definitely delicious things INSIDE the bread. You know, like the meat, the vegetables, the cheese, the sauces. What people want, but can't quite fork it in their mouths easily without the use of bread. Normally bread is just the vehicle for these ingredients, with slight taste variations between each vehicle. ... but the bread here was... well, it practically was its own ingredient. It was as much a star of the show as the things it held inside it. It was as if the bread didn't complement the food inside, but the food inside complemented the bread!  I'm sure many of you would be sorely disappointed after this ridiculous show of love of bread after you've eaten it... so erase what I said: Just think of a sandwich, where the bread accounts for more than just a third of the flavor. That's what you've got going on in here.  Goodcents is DEFINITELY a Subway-killer. I won't say it's a Quiznos-killer, as their tastes are very distinct from one another... But if you can compare it to anything: It's Subway, and it beats it, easily.  Thank you Goodcents, for giving me a better alternative."}
{"text":"What a shame!  I used to LOVE this place!  They USED to have some pretty awesome sandwiches, and pasta.  They USED to deliver pretty fast, too.   They were my go-to sub delivery place.  But recently, they changed chicken suppliers, and their chicken pasta tasted like the chicken spent 3-4 days in a refrigerator, as left overs. I took 3 bites and threw the rest out it was so gross. When I called to complain, I was met with apathy from the manager, who didn't offer to credit my debit card, but did offer another free pasta slop bowl. That did me no good whatsoever.  I called because their pasta and chicken was horrible.  Why would I want another, especially if I have to order another sandwich to get it.    I have also noticed over the last year or so, a very significant decline in quality of service.  In the past year, I have lost track of how they included some ingredient I didn't ask for or specifically told them to leave off, sent the wrong sandwich altogether, or otherwise royally screwed up the order.  The people who answer the phone sound like Bevis or Butthead when they answer the phone, and you always have to repeat your order 2-3 times, just so that their low-powered brains can catch up to what you are telling them.  I used to over look all that, but it seems like that has become more and more common, to the point that failure is par for the course there.    If you live within a 5 mile area of this place, just call Streets of New York or Jimmy Johns at 59th and Tbird, instead."}
{"text":"This place really doesn't have a novel business idea, it's just sandwiches.  But they do it well.  Probably some of the best sub sandwiches I've ever had.  I think the key is to just keep it simple.  And FRESH.  The ingredients look, taste and feel fresh and of a high quality.  Their prices are very reasonable. $5.50 for a footlong sandwich is on par with Subway's $5 footlong but this tastes better in my opinion.  Their bread is fresh and soft, not stale and crunchy like Subway.  Also, their tomatoes are red not green like Subway.  It helps that they don't have mildy retarded people and ex prisoners working there like does either.  All employees here have all their teeth and at least an average IQ from what I can tell.  Keep up the good work Goodcents, I will be coming back!  -The Duke of Goodcents"}
{"text":"I love Goodcents way better than Subway.  Their bread, meats and cheeses are so fresh.  They slice the meat and cheese right there for you.  It just tastes better.  They have some deals too.  When we went it was 2 footlong subs for $8 or something like that.  Maybe it was $8.99.  Either way a good deal.   I think that's Sundays. Give this place a shot, you will like it better than Subway too.  They have some $5 foot longs too. I recommend the Penny Club with spicy mustard, pepperjack cheese and \"standard dress.\""}
{"text":"I prefer this over subway anyday, used to avoid them when they first opened here due to higher prices, but they have since add $5 footlongs as an option.  I always get tuna subs at sub places and the tuna made at Goodcents is one of the best I've ever had (close second to Amiel's in Rochester, NY). That and the fresh rolls and fresh sliced cheese all add up to a great sub and a great sub shop."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My coworker and I go at least once a week and every time we do we marvel at how good a sandwich they serve. I love the turkey on garlic pepper bread and the staff knows us and is always so friendly. I highly recommend this over any other sandwich shop"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for the grand opening ! The food was amazing we came at the end of the night and left at 9 pm. When we returned home my friend noticed his cell phone was missing , long story short the staff lied to him and all of us, we were able to locate the cell phone with the \"find my cell phone app. \"And it showed up at the restaurant. We ended up going back there again and the phone magically showed up hidden on the side of the dumpster near the back door, The ringer had been turned to silent. I have been in the restaurant industry for many years and to have a group of employees that are untrustworthy is very bad for business ! Mr good cents is a great company with great food , their staff can't be trusted !!!!! This happened at the greenway location around 9pm on March 22!"}
{"text":"I live in the area for the past year or so every now and then I will stop by with my puppy. He's a wiener mix under 7 lbs. Anywho so the past year or so now every so often we will take a walk to mr goodcents. I hold him order sandwiches for my boyfriend and myself, pay, get food, and we walk home and enjoy our sandwiches. It's been a while since our last visit so tonight sounded like a good night for Mr. Gcents. Walk up there to find out that they're not so dog friendly even more and he can't even be in the store.. Even though I hold him the whole entire time and he never touches a little paw on the ground inside. Needless to say we were very pupset (pun intended). We decided to walk to Carl's Jr. Instead who let us order our food and even brought it outside to us while we were waiting. Just bummed my life will be lacking Mr Goodcents... But my furry little friend comes first"}
{"text":"My husband is addicted to their chicken Alfredo pasta bowl.  Their subs are the freshest tasting that I ever have had.  Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Tonight we encountered a line at Mr. Goodcents, but it was expertly handled by Shye and her coworker, a polite young man. She made sure our experience was fully satisfactory, and was apologetic even though we found their service for the crowd quite efficient. We've had a lot of good experiences since discovering my favorite sandwich shop, but tonight's service really stood out. Tonight, the 'standard dress' was top notch!"}
{"text":"A great healthy food every time! So much better than Subway trust me on this one you will enjoy a variety of selections as well as fresh bread fresh vegetables and great quality cold cuts."}
{"text":"On Sept 18th at around 6 pm my family and I had just come back in to town after being gone for almost 4 years. We were so excited to eat sandwiches from Mr. Good Cents because we used to eat there all of the time since it is near the home we own in Waddell. When we walked in we were a little surprised that the menu was different, apparently it's under new ownership... We ordered an had been on the road all day so we hadn't eaten any where else prior. We all had sandwiches and went home to bed. The next day my 8 year old was complaining of a stomach ache and wouldn't eat breakfast, then at around noon she began vomiting... At around 3 pm my husband began complaining of a tummy ache and he had the runs then began vomiting. I felt fine so I thought maybe it was just them but then at 9 pm my 2 year old starts vomiting in her sleep. So I had my husband, 8 year old and 2 year old vomiting all night, I was praying I wouldn't get sick but at 3 am my stomach began rumbling and I covered my mouth and ran to the rest room and ended up vomiting all over my hands. It was a long night... None of us got sleep. The only person that didn't get sick was my 6 month old and she was the only one that didn't eat at Mr. Good Cents. I wanted to call to let them know but I figured they probably wouldn't do anything. But if anyone else ate there on Sept 18 and got sick, we feel you. I had an entire family up all night running to the bathroom and many times my 8 year old and 2 year old didn't make it. My 2 year old kept vomiting in her sleep and I had to turn her over so she wouldn't choke on her vomit. It was so scary. Unfortunately we will never eat there again. It was horrible."}
{"text":"5 stars? For a sub shop? Yup, absolutely! Subway feels like an  assembly line compared to this place. Fresh rolls, all the cold cuts are prepared and sliced as you wait. Even the olives were really good, and I'm a bit of an olive snob.   I had the footlong tuna on whole wheat. The tuna was really fresh and it was a generous helping as well. Great pepper jack cheese that had a nice kick to it. I got it to go but I took a quick look around the inside and it looked clean and inviting. They had a TV mounted on the wall that had some sports playing. It had kind of a family diner feel to it.   On Sundays, any footlong cold sub is only $3.95. $3.95!!! I've paid that for a greasy pizza slice. For the same amount here you can get a delicious, fresh and healthy meal.   I can see this place being on the regular Sunday lunch rotation. Besides, it's a local business so why not support them? Give it a shot...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This Goodcents location is absolutely terrible, and that's a shame because I do love Goodcents sandwiches. A problem I have experienced multiple times is placing an order online or on the app. It gives you a time the order will be ready (15 minutes or so). It's never ready. I don't mean it's almost ready, it's like u never placed the order when u get there. You then have to wait as they squeeze u into the line. Today was the worst ever. I even gave them extra time. I was supposed to show up at 11:36, I waited 15 minutes later than that. They still hadn't even started it. They ignored me for quite awhile while I stood there and then when they said they would make my order, one of the employees who was leaving after spending the whole time I was there complaining about being scheduled and supposed to be off, she said to the person who said they would start my order \"you need to help the people in the line before you start that online order.\"  With that I said to cancel my order. At this point it should have been ready 30 minutes ago. I wouldn't give this store my business again. I'll go to a Goodcents, but NOT this one!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered ham and turkey with swiss full. Amazing super fresh and crispy Cookie is delicious got a cup of soup broccoli cheddar. It was okay nothing fancy overall delicious and will return"}
{"text":"Absolutely love these fresh subs. Been eating them since high school in the 90's. The fresh bread and the fact they slice the cold cuts right in front of you makes them the better sub shops."}
{"text":"Dane was awesome. Upgraded me from the $4 special to a $5 daily special. I was feelin sick and he hooked me up with a cup of chicken broth to go. Can't say enough how much little things like that mean. I'm already here a few times a month but I'll make sure to frequent this location more."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches, but you can feel the resentment from the staff.  Not sure what's going on there, but over the course of 3 years, each and every person I've ordered from made me feel like they really hated making the sub.  Maybe that's why they put the hard wood-like pepper stem core on every sub I've ever ordered.  The subs are good, that's why I keep going back. I just find that hard wooden pepper-stem part and remove it.  The store down on Bell @ 91st is a whole different story.....they seem genuinely happy to have you as a customer, but I'm not driving that far for a sub."}
{"text":"Good bread, decent selection and low prices. A decent sandwich for lunch. Nothing awesome..just adequate. Don't mind going here but not something I am going to look forward to."}
