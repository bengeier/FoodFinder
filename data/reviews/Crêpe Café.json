{"text":"If your in the area this place beats any St. Catherine (Golden Mile) cafe for crepes found in Montreal.  There portions are on the smaller side, but the quality overcomes this easily.  Service is terrific and friendly even for non-French speakers (oui)!  Coffee was great, went with a a 5 year old and my wife who are chocolate lovers.  They loved the hot chocolate and crepes.  I myself and on the more savory side and hade the ham and Swiss crepe; it was vey tasty.  Prices are about what you'd expect in a large city for breakfast."}

{"text":"So disappointed. 

Arrived there with my wife at 9:45 on a Sunday. The waitress told us they had a table ready but would need to be done before noon. Although it was unusual that someone tell us right away to hurry up even before we started, we didn't mind as we didn't plan to stay more than an hour. So we sat on the table there for 20 minutes without water or coffee. 

I told the waitress a few times that we wanted water, but she keep on pushing us back. By the time she's ready to serve us, it was a bit after 10 so there is no more breakfast MENU. 

WHAT A JOKE. 

We had to leave because their lunch menu a was awful.

Worst place ever.
