{"text":"The absolute worst service. I worked part time at the mall for a while and came here religiously. Initially tried to be friendly and make small talk 'cause I know they recognized me considering how much business I gave them, but they were always just downright rude. Tofu-fa is average, I'd still go there if I crave it when I'm at pmall, but I'd rather just get it at yum cha."}
{"text":"I LOVE the tofu fa at yan woo! They have the best tofu fa I have ever tried in Ontario so far.   I like how the syrup is already been mixed into the tofu fa. It so smooth and not TOO sweet! It's soooo GOOD!!! They also have a lot of flavour like almond, coconut, ginger, red bean, green bean....and more. But I like the original flavour the most. (original tofufa $1.99, other flavours $2.45)  Oh! They also have these combo that are pretty good, such as the combo B (Soya milk  + stir-fried rice noodle roll with bean sprouts  OR stir-fried noodle with bean sprouts) $2.99 for this combo. I usually pick stir-fried rice noodle roll with bean sprouts! Put some soy sauce, hoisin sauce (sweet sauce)..OH MY.. so good!  If you are in a rush and don't have time to sit down and eat. You can buy take-out: The tofu fa is $5.50 for a box and $10 for 2 boxes. A box is enough for probably 4-5 people. The soya milk is $2.50 for a bottle (around 1L or more, I don't remember...) and $4.75 for two bottles."}
{"text":"The tofu dessert pudding was wonderful!  Silky-soft goodness that literally slid down my throat!  I haven't had tofu with better texture.  I had the original version (hot, with ginger syrup), and it was a perfect pick-me-up.  My only little complain was that the soybean flavour could have been a bit stronger/more concentrated.  Otherwise, great stuff at a decent price!"}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad, but after receiving possibly the worst customer service of my life, I decided to stop going. There's a lady with dyed orange hair that works behind the counter that has the worst attitude ever. I ordered fried noodles for me and my friend, and after they made it I realized my friend had an allergy to sesame seeds. So I decided to order another one and told them I didn't want sesame seeds in this one. It's not like I'm trying to scam them for an additional dish, I literally said I would pay for the extra one. This orange-haired lady starts MUMBLING behind the counter saying that we should have known well ahead of time giving dirty looks and heavy sighs. First of all, if you're going to complain, do it when the customer's gone (at least that wouldn't be as disgusting as doing it to their face). Second of all, you work in the food service lady, drop that attitude. I really do appreciate the food items this place has to offer, but the owner or whoever seriously needs to reconsider hiring proper staff."}
{"text":"Their tofu-fa is kept at a low price and has remained the same quality over the years.  However, the other food they offer (noodles, friend cakes...etc.) are either too oily or burnt.  Not the healthiest option.  I agree with many of the comments below, the ladies who work there are downright rude to all customers, regardless of the language you speak.  Just like some other customers, I was \"reminded\" to tip them...  for what I do not know."}
{"text":"Ever since I was little till now, one of my all time favorite Asian dessert has to be tofu-fa, or in other words, tofu pudding. The tofu pudding at Yan Woo is the smoothest I've had in Canada. The look of the restaurant itself may not be the most appealing, as a matter of fact, it looks a little run down but I personally don't mind it. For the prices that you are paying at this location, it's totally worth it in my opinion. A bowl of the original tofu pudding is only $1.99 and if you like to add toppings or flavors such as coconut milk or sticky rice to your tofu pudding, it's only $2.45 a bowl. They also offer take out for both the tofu pudding as well as the soy beverages that they make there. In addition to all the soy goodies, they offer a small selection of fried noodles that you can order on the side to go with your tofu pudding and drink. The noodles are only $2.99 a dish (1 person serving). The prices here are ridiculously affordable, definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"There is no dispute to the \"tofu fa\" that is offered at Yan Woo.  It is the gem of the store.  Every time when I walk by Market Village, I will go in and have one with ginger sauce.  It is silky smooth and melts in your mouth.  No other comparison to this product in Toronto.  The sprout fried noodle is also good but the main dish is still the \"tofu fa\"  I have tried the same store in Hong Kong.  It is very personal.  I like it very much.  It is even more silky that in Toronto.  But there are comments that it is too soft and not thick enough.    The service here is not so good.  Worst part is at night after the floor cleaning, it stinks."}
{"text":"I really like the tofu dessert here. Cheap price $2.75. Bring me back alot of memory."}
{"text":"Even before setting foot into this establishment, my mom had warned me about their poor service. But the place had survived this many years with that bad reputation because their tofu desserts are just that good.  While I absolutely agree that the tofu is phenomenal, this cannot justify nor pardon the exceptionally poor service rendered here.  I usually err on the side of generous with my Yelp reviews, but the bitter taste left in my mouth by our one female server simply could not be washed out by the silky soft tofu fa.   I am a VERY accommodating person, and honestly, easygoing to a fault: I'll put up with you demanding us to sit down as we erroneously approached the counter to place our order, intentionally ignore us as we try to order, roll your eyes and mumble a very audible complaint under your breath for requesting extra spoons, and treat us as though you were doing us a big favor by making a purchase at your store. But when you try to pull this ish on us and then bully my Mom to tip you more, you have crossed the damn line. I pulled a tooney out of the pile of change she left on the tip tray for my Mom as she looked on with much cathartic delight...Only to hear her say an earnest 'thank you.' Guess the lesson is, sometimes you have to fight fire with fire. We still ended up leaving about 10% tip for the other waitress who served us. But dayum. BAI."}
{"text":"It's a small shop that really reminds me of stores in Hong Kong. I had the almond soya drink and soya drink with sesame rice ball. The drink was very smooth and tasted just like soy milk and had a slight almond flavor. The soya drink with the sesame rice ball was what I liked the most. The sesame rice balls were really tasty and tasted strongly of sesame even though the filling was a bit gritty."}
{"text":"PRICES: MAKE SURE YOU CALCULATE THE PRICES OF WHAT YOU'VE ORDERED. There is no bill because you have to go to the front to pay. They double check what you have ordered then tell you the price. In the price they add a 15% tip forcing you to pay that much, so don't tip on top of the price. This is what I don't like about the place because tips aren't mandatory. Of course I will tip them no matter how poor their service is but I think it's wrong to force a 15% tip on customers when it's not even the law. Previous comments have said that they were yelled for not giving tips so that's probably why they force their customers to give tip which is ridiculous. FOOD: Their soybean products are the only worthy foods at the restaurant. Everything else is bland or too salty. They also give a shit ton of bean sprouts for the set meals so they don't have to give you nice portions. If you want cheap and good food I would just go to the congee place right across this store.  SERVICE: They are the reason why Chinese restaurants are generalized for having such poor service. Overall verdict: Not coming to this place ever again because I feel cheated that they force you to tip 15% without even telling you because there is no bill. I finally understand the reason why I avoided this place for over 5 years even though I used to be a fan of their soya drink when I was younger."}
{"text":"I loved this place, even though the ladies were mean sometimes. I'm very upset its gone now ):"}
{"text":"To-fu-fa (sweet tufu pudding) was wonderful. The place seems like a 90's worm hole.  Dessert: 5/5 Amazingly smooth To-fu-Fa. Service: 3/5 Informal and efficient Environment: 3/5 Like a 90's Chinese takeout place. Washrooms: N/A Mall ones are available. Worth it?: 4/5 Great when you want To-fu-Fa.  This place is best known for their To-fu-Fa. I must say it's the best place to get it in town. This place has been around forever and so has their decor. The colors of orange and beige are very 90's like. The colors, photos and new articles haven't changes at all over the years. It's just one of those places that didn't need to wow you to bring back business.   This place definitely specializes in tofu products. The menu is very short and does not carry a lot of options. I've also tried there turnip cakes and was disappointed. I would recommend sticking to there best sellers, to-fo-fa and soy milk. This is not a place to bring group of friends who is looking for sharing different desserts. I still like this place. I will come back as long as this place is still around."}
{"text":"This little gem is located inside Pacific Mall.  I've been a fan of Yan Woo in HK and this store in Toronto doesn't disappoint.  For $4.85, you get a tofu with fish paste, cheung fun and tofu fa (dessert).  What a bargain!"}
{"text":"Location/Service Inside Market Village entrance facing Steeles Ave. This restaurant is closing down near the end of December since the mall is being demolished.  Very plain decor, brings back the typical HK 90s style. Service wise was okay, expected from a fast paced Chinese restaurant. If you be more chill and laid back, the waitresses are pretty cool to talk with. The owner is also very nice.   Food Famous for the tofu and soybean, ordered a combo meal (~$6), which had soybean milk, fried tofu curds with fish meat and stir fried rice noodles with bean sprouts. The dishes itself were okay and smaller in a portion size. But for the price it's pretty decent. I really like the soybean milk, which is very smooth.   I will miss this place as I've been eating here since I was a child. If you have time and would like to grab a quick lunch/meal, this is your to go place."}
{"text":"I usually get a drink when i shop arpund, but when i just order one soy bean milk, they are not pleasant, bad customer service, the drink is okay, but considerong $1.50 for a cup i can get a 2L bottle with $2.00 in chinese market."}
{"text":"The first few times  I came here  I thought the place was pretty good. There was a nice lady there but i think she left.  But not too long ago, I came here and i realized how bad of a person these waitresses can be. Asking for more tips than they deserve. I mean tips is based on service.   Seeing how you can even have the face to ask for it, makes me wonder why they even deserve tips.  OH YEAH! i forgot . i asked if they had some soya sauce ... AND THEY TOLD ME IF I WAS BLIND... THERES SOYA SAUCE RIGHT THERE!!."}
{"text":"Why the bad reviews?! I grew up having the tofu sweet soup after school almost everyday when I was in HK. It's still the best tofufa I've had anywhere including NYC and Vancouver. The original store in Hong Kong was opened in 1893."}
{"text":"When you read through the laminated Yan Woo Soya Bean Foods menu you will probably think to yourself why is this place SO cheap?  Like REALLY cheap!  The menu looks like it was printed in the 90s and never updated and everything is around $2-3!!  We came here for a quick snack.  Since they are soya bean specialists, we tried their soya bean drink (chocolate), two orders of tofu fa (one cold coconut and one hot black sesame), and one fried bean curd with minced fish.  I can really complain, they really are soy experts!  Their tofu-fa really is smooth like butta, just don't order the coconut, it was gross...  Everything was good, and it was only $10!  What the heck!  All other desert places charge $5+ just for a single tofu-fa.  Here you get much better quality at a very very affordable price.  4 stars - great bang for your buck!  Cash only!"}
{"text":"I wasn't hungry but more thirsty so I got a glass of the cold Soya Drink with Almond Flavour.  K got the Soya Bean Puddy with Almond Flavour and the Fried Rice Noodle Roll with Bean Sprout.  All of the items here are very, very inexpensive.  I'm talking about spending less than $10 for a full meal and filling your belly happily.  The cold Soya Drink with Almond Flavour was really smooth, silky, and tasted good.  The almond flavour was there too.  The Soya Bean Puddy with Almond Flavour also had the strong almond flavour but in puddy/pudding form.  It was really smooth and tasted good too!  The Fried Rice Noodle Roll with Bean Sprout was a very simple dish -- stir fried rice noodle roll with a bit of soy sauce and bean sprouts.  It was comfort food and good as well.  You can get their soya milk or soybean pudding in tubs for super cheap.  In my opinion, it's great for parties and sharing at home!"}
{"text":"3.5 rating.  This store is known for their soy milk and tofu pudding. I believe their soy milk is made in stores. My parents sometimes like to buy a carton of soy milk from them. Yesterday I tried their almond soy milk, and it was tasty you can definitely taste the almond flavour and for 1.25 it's a good price. They also have other flavours as well such as original and chocolate."}
{"text":"Everything is good!!! We come from NYC just to eat this. We have tried everything on the menu!! Best tofu fa hands down!"}
{"text":"Cheap ($2.45) tofu dessert and it's definitely good value considering the price and taste. But wow, the ladies have so much attitude, like they don't even want to take your money nor care for your business."}
{"text":"the \"tofu fa\" is the best here! silky smooth, melts in your mouth! get it hot!"}
{"text":"I come here when I'm just a LITTLE thirsty & I feel for something HEALTHY.  A little thirsty simply because for less than a couple bucks you can have a cup of their Famous Soya Milk but don't expect a bucket full, you ONLY paid a couple bucks after all.  At certain times of the day, they will have Daily Combination Specials that pair their snack food with a drink which is a good snack option.  I usually go with the Fried Noodle the ones where you've seen it at Dim Sum places.   Did I mention SNACK?  It's snack portions of course but most combinations are under $5.00 so if you don't want to spoil your dinner and want something Healthy and Lactose-Free then give it a try.  Maybe it's psychological, but I sometimes can taste the plastic when I have Soy Milk from the typical grocery store packaging.  Yan Woo Soy feels much cleaner and fresher."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The food and drink is super affordable! Usually I'd get the B combo set that has the fried noodle and soy milk for $3+. But today I just got the fried noodle for $2.50 and it was good enough to fill me up. It's a small plate of food but that's what I like because then I can have room to eat or drink other stuff. I really like their soy milk and my relatives really like their soy bean/tofu pudding. Service...a little rude today. Long story short: we received one wrong item, told waitress, waitress looked upset, waitress walked away and told cook something along the lines of \"ugh forget it. Make them the other thing.\" I'll give food 5/5. Service 3/5. Recommendation: soy milk, soy bean pudding, and affordable $2.50 fried noodles xD"}
{"text":"What others say is true. The lady who works there is very rude. I ordered and she gave me a puzzled look and look at the other person that was with me. I asked for the ginger sauce and she acted like it doesn't exist, even though we have gotten that here before. Rude! She has a expressless and snarky face. Place is a bit dirty too, particularly around the frying around."}
{"text":"The soymilk was pretty good, but their tofu wasn't very silky or good in terms of texture. As others have mentioned, service isn't great. Know what you want, let them know what you're having, and have your cash ready. I'd probably just stop by for the soymilk but not the tofu in the future."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  I've been coming here for many years now whenever I'm at Market Village but I stopped for a few years (probably 7 years now?) because I didn't frequent the place enough. However I went back twice in the past week cause I randomly craved for their food.   Surprisingly their prices haven't gone up as high as I expected (still a good price for snacks a light meal). I usually get Combo A ($4.85) or B ($3.25) (either rice roll with bean sprout or noodle with bean sprout, tofu fish cake or turnip cake, and soya milk). Their to-fu-fa is the best -- it's super soft! My mom likes the original but I like the one mixed with grass jelly. There's many toppings to choose from and everything on the menu is pretty much less than $3 except for the combos.   I took off half a star 'cause of the service is kinda meh. Some staffs are nicer than others. It can be hard to get their attention sometimes 'cause they'll look at you and then look away which is so annoying. They serve your food and that's about it.   I do hope they open up at another location when they tear down Market Village! Would be sad to see them go."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  I come to have their \"tofu fa\" multiple times whenever I visit Toronto.  One I like the most is the black sticky rice, it's good hot or cold.  I do have to say that all their tofu fa are good, not just the one I had!!  Their other food (like friend noodles) are only so so.  I could have better elsewhere.  Just go for the tofu fa here!!"}
{"text":"The service here is horrendous.  I order two tofu desserts which were very silky and good, one or of fried tofu which was okay they don't really fry it well, and one order of friend taro which was okay.  The service makes me nNEVER want to come back. The waitresses were rude when I asked what a picture was and to,d me to sit down and wait or look at the menu. Obviously, I can read but I wanted to know what it was.  Secondly when paying, I picked up my change and the waitress was mumbling constantly under her breath 'you HAVE to give tip'!!! That is ridiculous!!!!! I, the paying customer dont have to give anything!!  While I was eating, the waitresses sat down and were talking to each other and on their phones.  Never coming back despite how good their food is. If you must try take it to go, these b$;)/&@ will not be getting another cent of my business, or Canada I guess you can say 5 cents."}
{"text":"Yes, a 5 star review for a simple place that specializes in soya bean products. My review though is only based on their tofu-fa. $5.75 for a container of tofu-fa to take home and share. The container of tofu-fa was quite large and can feed about 3-4 people sparingly. But to be honest I could have eaten the whole container myself since it was so good. The lady behind the counter said that no sweetener was required which I thought was odd but I took her word for it and she was right. I thought it was perfectly sweetened as well, like it was made just for me. Another thing that made this tofu-fa so amazing was how silky smooth it was. I also found it to have the perfect bounce and thickness to it. Not too soft and not too hard but juuuuuust right. You can also eat it hot or eat it cold and it tasted just as good.   I'm starting to sound like I work for this place or something but I really think the tofu-fa was that good. Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"Love the foods from this place. Even friends request for it when they come visit. Anyone know if they relocated somewhere else???"}
{"text":"I'm very picky with soy milk because I've been spoiled by my grandma making her own soy milk since I can remember. I prefer my soy milk to be rich in taste but not too thick in texture, sweet in taste but not sugary. Yan Woo makes the best soy milk I have had in Toronto. I always get a cup or two whenever I pass by this place.   Their silken tofu dessert is one of the best as well. I like their original or with red beans.   I'm not a huge fan of their other cooked food as I find it mediocre at best, but it is fairly cheap and it comes with a cup of soy milk."}
{"text":"Great place to seat down for soy products.   They have 3 different combo specials.  The soya drink is amazingly refreshing.   Soya bean puddy is silky smooth.  The stuffed tofu is a bit on the oily side."}
{"text":"2* for the food, negative stars for service if I could.   Location/Service:  I have heard great things about this place and heard that they were moving/closed down due to the new year construction so I had to check it out before it was too late. It is a very fast paced place where you can definitely get your tofu pudding dessert and/or your soya milk fix. There are SO many kinds of tofu pudding that you can choose from and since it was my first time there I didn't know what to get. In the end I got the tofu pudding with ginger flavour ($2.75) and the very basic one ($2.25) to compare. Both for takeout. The service there was absolutely CRAPPY. The two older ladies there didn't really wanted to serve me and had a REALLY BAD attitude. It seems like they were fed up with the place or they just didn't want to work. I got really intimidated when I didn't know what to order and they made it seem like I was the one who was being indecisive. I asked them for extra spoons and they angrily said that she had already put them in the plastic bag. I asked how big eat takeout bowl was and they felt so bothered by my questions. I asked if I could have a no-sugar basic tofu pudding and she rudely said NO and that they all have sugar in them. Seriously, what's wrong with you? I was just asking.  Both the tofu pudding were very smooth. When you eat it, the tofu will just slide down your throat. Delicious. But I don't care how good your food is, when you give me HORRIBLE service, I don't think I will want to buy from you. Why go there when I feel so intimidated?   I don't know if they are full closed down or moving somewhere else, but sorry, no more ever."}
{"text":"I can't compare to the one in Hong Kong because I've never been there but it's not like I've never had tofu before in my life. Tofu fa is probably my favorite Chinese dessert and it's hard to find them freshly-made.   They have a lot of dessert options if you don't like tofu fa but the whole point of coming here is to have some! I ordered the cold almond tofu fa; only problem was it wasn't cold but rather room temperature. I had high expectations since I was looking forward to something like the packaged ones I usually ate but I was disappointed after the first bite. The texture of it was fluffy and soft, like if you cut the layers in half, little pieces will fall out. I wouldn't say it was smooth or anything because it immediately disintegrates once it goes in your mouth. There was also not a strong almond taste, so you probably would've never guessed it was almond tofu if I asked for a random tofu dessert.   It was hard to try to finish the whole thing because the syrup was so sweet and overwhelming, plus I'm not very used to eating room-temperature desserts. Very fast service and cheap but I'll just buy a box of Dofu Delight instead."}
{"text":"My recent visit here was a good reminder of why I used to love this place. Their soyabean puddings are pretty damn good. I ordered the soya bean with black sticky rice (hot) and my friend got the soya bean with taro (cold). We have come to the conclusion that it's smoother and fresher if you have it hot than cold. The toppings were quite generous and though it is a little bit too sweet, it was still one of the best I have had. It was a gentleman and lady working today and the gentleman who served us was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"If you are into soya bean products and food, this is the place to go!!  This location of Yan Woo supposed to be the 16th location of this Hong Kong based franchise.  I have them since I was a child when I was in Hong Kong and I am so glad they opened one in Toronto!  Their sweet tofu pudding is so good! Prepared freshly everyday in the store. You can pick either hot or cold version or you can has different flavour with red bean, green bean, black sticky rice (my favourite), peanut, almond... and much more!!  They also has seating that you can order little snacks to eat in. They have fried noodles, congee, rice roll, fried tofu.  You can also buy family packed sweet tofu pudding, tofu, soy bean drink (sweet or unsweetened).  You really have to try the tofu pudding.. it is like silk! Just slide into your throat good!  CASH only!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Yan Woo Soya ever since elementary school. I often wonder how this store is able to maintain the same price and quality for over ten years. $1.99 for original silken tofu pudding (\"tofu-fa\" in Chinese), $2.45 for more unconventional flavours (such as sesame paste, walnut paste or almond paste with tofu pudding). My favorite is coconut sango with tofu pudding. Smooth tofu sweetened by rich coconut milk with chewy tapioca pearls to enhance the overall texture of the dessert.  Perhaps it is nostalgia, perhaps it is my love for all things soy; Yan Woo Soya Bean has the best silken tofu dessert in Toronto. There is something comforting about smooth lightly sweetened silken tofu that not only warms your belly, but also you heart!"}
{"text":"Little place located inside Market Village. Like other yelpers mentioned this place specializes in tofu fa. It's made fresh and velvety smooth. I love the texture (soft and smooth) and fresh taste. Tofu fa can be served hot or cold; by itself or with other toppings.  I also ordered take out container of tofu fa and fresh soy milk. Soy milk tastes fresh but a bit on the sweet side."}
{"text":"A no-frills, super-cheap, minimal service outlet of a famous HK franchise that serves a divine soy bean pudding.  My family has eaten here on every trip to Markham, and usually load up a few tubs in a cooler to take back to the States.  The basic soy bean pudding is a silky soft tofu in a light syrup, and practically melts in your mouth.  I love it also with ginger syrup.  Also tried it with sesame soup but that combo doesn't work quite so well (possibly true for all the non-syrup toppings) and the sesame soup was subpar.  Their cold soy bean drink is great, refreshingly light and tasting of bean.  They have a few food items, most notably the fried noodles that you see them constantly preparing by the counter.  That and some other things on the menu are available in very cheap set menus, just a few dollars for a full meal.  I never tried any of these though."}
{"text":"yeah, great soya products.  famous for their soy milk and \"tofu fa\" (a \"pudding\" w/texture like panna cotta, maybe even a bit softer and wetter. served in syrup).  liked the modern approach of mixing two kinds of \"sweet soup\" items in one bowl (ex. tofu fa & black sesame sweet soup), but when asked if they make the other sweet soups on premise, they honestly stated that it's from a package.  ok then, i'm sticking w/\"home-made\" product.  their famous tofu fa was flavorful and smooth.  they also have some savory snack and drink items if you're not in to sooth the sweet tooth.  good pit shop amidst/after a day of shopping.   caveat: this place is located in the renowned market village/pacific mall, so going on the weekend would be horrendous--the parking, that is. :)"}
