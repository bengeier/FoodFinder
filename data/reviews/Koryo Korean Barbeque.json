{"text":"This food court stand serves up delicious and hearty flame-broiled meat plates with good servings of vegetable and rice sides.  A great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"A great choice when you need to eat at the food court. The prices seem a little steep at first, but then you realize that you can get filled up quickly for less than $10 on tasty food that doesn't make you feel dumpy afterwards.    The daily special is some combo item with a free pop. The focus here is on the meats, finished off on a huge grill, with a salt/sweet Korean BBQ sauce.  The meat is accompanied by rice (plain or seasoned) and you choice of various hot and cold sides (about 10 available on any given day).  The hot garlic potatoes are both unusual and tasty, fried crispy then tossed in a somewhat sweet sauce.  The only caveat about this place is that the cold sides are actually cold, e.g. cooked brocolli served at 4 degrees Celsius.  I'm sure this is due to health regulations, but is a bit off-puting if not forewarned.  They also have soups starring the aforementioned meats, and although it's not on the menu, you can substitute the vermecelli noodles for glass noodles, which I always find a lot more fun to eat!"}
{"text":"Wow that was the worst Koryo meal I've ever had:( The potatoes were probably day old and received, the meat was obviously recooked since it was dried up, the bean sprouts tasted like salty tap water. It was pretty bad I couldn't finish my meal."}
{"text":"Ever since I tried a sample of their garlic potatoes, I've been hooked. SO GOOD! I usually order the short ribs or beef & chicken with noodles and of course the potatoes.   I've been eating here time and time again and I've never been disappointed.   Tip: ask for bbq sauce, it goes with everything on the menu (trust me, it's better than it sounds)"}
{"text":"This Koryo is amazing.  The service is quick and delicious.  I recommend the koryo steak combo with green beans and potatoes.  oh those potatoes are the best in the world.  I could lay in a pool of koryo potatoes."}
{"text":"I come here almost everyday , This is the best foodcourt place in STC , Freshly make Meat and also all the variety of sides dishes , there's the hot and cold sides dishes that we can pick from .. So many choices :)love it"}
{"text":"They are rude from start to finish, despite never being busy they will always rush you, they won't listen to what you are asking, they will dump the food on your plate and send you home angry. The food has gotten me sick twice, the people have gotten me mad every time. I asked them to put my spring rolls in a separate box so they don't get sauce on them, he said no threw it In the same plate and then poured sauce on it. They have horrible customer service and bad food preparation practices, if I knew somebody in the health service industry I would report this place immediately. The owners carelessness had reached new heights. The food now comes burnt and it definitely doesn't feel clean. He used the same tongs for raw, cooked meat, then used it on the French fries."}
{"text":"First time trying this place since moving into the building next to Centennial. Tried the beef bibimbap today and it came with nicely grilled beef that was seasoned perfectly topped with broccoli, radish, carrots, bean sprouts and sunny side fried egg with sauce on top. It was delicious and. The portion was very filling. Will try other items next time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far as I was getting tired of taco bell, sushi never fills you up for under 10$ and shang hai 360 so I figured I'd give this place a shot. I've ordered the #3 there twice so far and it's really good. You have many options what to go with your combo as well. As everyone would say the garlic fries are worth the trip there. The location is easy to find and I honestly feel sorry for all the people who would rather go to mcdonalds downstairs instead of trying something new as there is from Greek / Mediterranean to Japanese in the food court so the people ordering just big macs they can get down the road are totally missing out.   the prices work considering how much food you get, the beef and chicken is good.  Again many options for what you want, you get the food very fast too.   ways to improve to get that prestigious five star label the side dishes behind the glass I remember the first time i went there i pointed to the stuff, the girl was patient enough to figure out what I wanted though.   a website would be great to get to know the menu a bit better like taco bell has and all   I would offer combos with just the garlic fries, beef , chicken or ribs and a drink as the two massive scoops of white rice can get sickly and I end up throwing the last scoop but still the food is good and I'd recommend it.  I've yet to try the japanese place but this place and shang hai depending on my cravings are my top 2 as Machnu Wok puts way too much spice and flavor into their foods. Usually this would be a complement but go there and find out what I mean."}
{"text":"What a shame. This place use to serve something really special! I still remember the first time I tried their potatoes along side their beef bbq and rice. So satisfying, almost like magic! But that was over ten years ago. It seems these new staff have no sense of pride in what they serve---it really is an insult to the customer for them to serve such garbage to people. It just takes a little bit of respect to put it together---such a shame!  Day-old fried potatoes hard as rocks and cold such that it is inedible; \"tofu\" watery as if soaked in dishwater that tastes about as appealing. Meat that was palatable, though drenched in sauce. With the way they treat everything else, I began to wonder what sort of swill was in that sauce, and I simply lost my appetite. How could anyone serve such food to another human being? I could not even finish it. Would you say this deserves even one star? Use to be a favourite mall spot of mine for a quick, delicious lunch. Now: Never. Going. Back. So sad!"}
{"text":"I like this place - it's actually VERY good for a food court restaurant. I've had the BBQ short ribs (~$10) a few times and they've always tasted delicious. My usual sides are green beans and kimchi. The green beans are delicious (and I don't usually throw around praise for green beans) and the short ribs also taste good. Obviously, it doesn't taste as good as homemade kalbi, or kalbi from a full service Korean restaurant, but I'd take it over any other food court meats. The kimchi is usually pretty weak, but I guess they don't want to scare off customers who can't take the heat.   I think the food actually tastes better if you take it to go and let it sit for a while. The beans and kimchi give some really good flavour to the white rice. Even better is if you have some GOOD kimchi at home to add a much needed kick to an otherwise great $10 mall meal.   The service has always been quick and friendly. The food is usually ready in just a few minutes."}
{"text":"I always stop here for lunch whenever I have my dentist/blood work appointments. The LA kalbi (longitudinally sliced beef short ribs) is my favourite -- deliciously marinated short ribs grilled to order with an optional sweet savoury barbecue sauce.  You can get a choice of three side dishes if you don't ask for rice.  My usual preferences are jap chae (glass noodles with saut√©ed cabbage and a hint of garlic), kim chi, garlic glass potatoes and seasoned omelette (the rest of the vegetables, i.e. green beans and broccoli, have been pre-boiled and were sitting cold even in the chafing dishes).  Unfortunately, due to the downturn in the Alberta economy, the portion sizes of my sides have become smaller, especially the jap chae."}
{"text":"Last night, after watching a horror flick, I wanted some good ol' Koryo from the Scarborough Town Centre. That is my go-to spot every time I'm grabbing some grub from the food court. My usual is the Korean BBQ Steak. It's chopped thin pieces of bbq steak in this teriyaki-type of sauce with two spoonfuls of rice and you get to two sides for $6.49. My usual sides are the cold macaroni salad--it's sooooo good. It's got a slightly sweet taste added to it which is just different from any type of macaroni salad's from food courts. The next side I chose was the glass garlic noodles which are sooo delicious!  Unfortunately yesterday, the regular Korean BBQ Steak wasn't the \"special\" anymore. It's been a special for at least a year. They now have some bbq chicken special. While they do still have the Korean BBQ Steak still, it's just not $7.99. Regardless of it not being the special, I was craving it badly and had my heart set on it.  The regular folks who work there weren't there this time around so I thought for some reason, I would be jipped on the servings and generosity of extra sauce that I always ask for, but I was wrong. The guy serving our portion was very generous, gave us the extra sauce we wanted and actually presented it very neatly as if it took great pride in his job. I ate last night AND had enough for lunch today. Not bad for $7.99!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty fast food! I love their BBQ Chicken with a side of egg and another one of garlic potatoes over seasoned rice ... hmmm ...  FRIENDLY staff, TASTY and reasonably priced fast food!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place when I was in the area as the previous koryo locations that are now closed (Sherway gardens and Yonge/Dundas) always had big servings.   If you were used to those, you'd be disappointed with this one as they staff try their best to put less food on your plate. Asking for extra servings on those sides will be met with a scowl.   It's only a matter of time as nobody buys from this place. Good riddance in advance haha"}
{"text":"As mall food court stalls go, what they serve could easily have come from a more upscale Korean place. Ignore the fact that you're eating on disposable plates with plastic cutlery -- the beef short ribs and chicken are tender, juicy, and tasty. Order the jap chae (glass noodles) instead of rice to get a more authentic Korean dining experience. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Koryo Korean barbeque is without a doubt some of Calgary's tastiest food court fare. A meal may run a little more expensive than a burger, but considering that it comes with a significant side of rice and vegetables, I think I can live with that. I adore the special sauce, and always get them to load it on, as it is soooo good soaked into the rice. I love to get the chicken, and the BBQ flamers are all pretty delicious. I love the diverse selection of sides which really adds to the food. Koryo is definitely more than just a typical take-out joint."}
{"text":"I love koryo. But this location was just no good. I don't know what happened to this location. It used to be clean and the cashier used to be nice.   Now they have \"specials\" plastered all over the place. (I.e.) I asked for the chicken and beef \"special\" they had posted up for a special price only to be told that it wasn't the special for the day. No where did it indicate it wasn't avaliable for that price today.   I had shown the cashier my loyalty card to collect points and she had said okay, she took my payment, and then when I tried handing over my loyalty card she said \"sorry too late\". Still totally confused.   As I waited patiently for my food... I watched as someone in the back was flipping through the marinated meat. No hand hygiene done at all during the five minutes I stood there.   I ordered the shrimp with my meal, it's... Microwaved before being plopped on the grill. Mmmm. Such delicious microwaved shrimp... So not worth it.   The self serve cutlery at the end of the line were covered in soot from the grill, didn't trust myself to use it until I washed it.   Note to self: next time I crave rice in the area I'll go next door."}
{"text":"Two words: Manic Mondays.   I wandered into Century Plaza after coming across a couple of highly rated food court spots. 5-star food court experiences tend to pique my interest.  My nose sniffed out Koryo BBQ before my eyes noticed it in the back corner of the food court. The menu looked innocent enough: chicken, beef or ribs BBQ'd up with rice and your choice of two sides as a combo, soups, dumplings, and the likes.   I was the only one standing at the counter at 130 on a Monday afternoon. The man behind the counter looked up and asked \"You ready to order?\" I hadn't quite decided what I wanted, but I blurted out \"I guess I'll go with the chicken and beef combo.\" He rung it in and then asked \"Anything to drink?\" I declined the drink thinking $7.99 for the combo was enough for that day. He totaled up my bill and said \"Ok, $2.04 please.\" Ummm... what?  I glanced at him to see if he had caught his mistake, but he continued to smile up at me while he waited for me to pay. I was about to question the amount when my eyes fell upon the large banner behind the man. \"Manic Mondays - Beef & Chicken combo $1.99\" it read. It was no mistake. Mondays, between 1pm-3pm, Koryo offers one of their combos for $1.99. I just so happened to pick the special for that week. I should've ordered a drink."}
{"text":"i really love the bbq steak there, but their customer service is the worst. every one in the store seems frustrated and angry!"}
{"text":"This franchise is not bad. The BBQ beef was very good. And the crystal noodles are good too. If you have to eat in a food court, this is not a bad option.."}
{"text":"Well, well, well.  What do we have here.  If you're heading out at lunch be sure to grab yourself some Koryo BBQ.  This is a special treat you DON'T eat everyday, but rather when you're taking a break from a diet. That's not to say the food choices are ALL bad.  Koryo offers a great selection of sides which even includes BROCCOLI and GREEN BEANS!  The garlic potatoes though cannot be turned down..  Here's a little tip from ME to YOU.  IF you order a dish with sides, I usually order the BEEF and CHICKEN, you may substitute the rice for another side!  Not many people know this.  You're welcome.  Make sure you grab a little cup full of the bbq sauce.  Oh man, it's that orangy beigy deliciousy sauce good for dippin'.  It's a heavy meal that may make for an uncomfortable afternoon at the desk, but it's very delicious. They are very fast getting you through and they even grill up the meat right in front of you!  The Udon soup is also a fan favourite at my place of work.  If you're looking for some Korean flavours, but don't want anything too fast foody, try Koryo!  Centennial Place even offers WIFI!"}
{"text":"Bad food bad service.  My son and I were the only customers, 3:30pm on a Tuesday.  I asked for no rice and got rice, my potatoes were so old that they were inedible, and my chicken was over cooked.   My son asked for spring roll and got potatoes."}
