{"text":"Great prices mouthwatering bbq. The sauce is finger licking good! !  This barbecue place has a food truck that comes to my work occasionally well they have started cumming inside the building and doing catering in the lunchroom the last couple times they came they were sold out before I got a chance to get any of this time I made sure I showed up early to get my fill of barbecue!  They were serving two meats and two sides for $10 they had hot links barbecue chicken amazing ribs and brisket they also had macaroni and cheese some TLC potato salad baked beans and greens"}
{"text":"Greens were a bit overrated, but the meat was delicious. I can only imagine how good it would be if everything was made fresh to order!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Rubie Duckworth! What a gem of a place, great catfish, amazing value and the candied yams were perfect. Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Stopped there today with a buddy and the  food was as it gets . The ribs were amazing the hot links were terrific. one of the best bbq in the country only draw back was he was out of brisket ( had a party that ordered Brisket ) his baked beans are out of this world. you must try cookies food!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way to this restaurant. Dealt with horrible parking situation. Walked through crowded casino. Approached restaurant host. Only to learn they only allow takeout for hotel guests."}
{"text":"The portion size is nice. I ordered a pork rib dinner for under $12. I recieved 5 nice meaty bones, with my choice of baked beans and cabbage. First off, the cabbage looked as if it was boiled in old grease. It sat overcooked broken emulsion pool of oily water juice. My beans were sloppily poured in the compartment next to and on top of half of my cabbage. The beans which were from a can had ground beef added to them, and they would have been good if not for the salt content. They were soooo salty I only ate three bites. Giving each a taste a chance, to be sure I was not over reacting. The ribs had a nice bite and smokey flavor but again....salty as all heck. I would guess it was the rub. Who ever is doing the seasoning must be very heavy handed or not tasting the food during and after cooking. *my advice, you could elevate your baked bean dish by using using dry beans instead of canned ones. Try saut√©ing your cabbage to order instead instead of boiling it in with and in fat or with fatty meat."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Friendly people. The catfish was amazing. Very impressed. Only flaw is that for bbq- no pulled pork the day i went. Seems they do one specialty a day- i went on ribs day.  Again, the fish was unreal. The fries sucked but didnt care the fish was so good."}
{"text":"BBQ & Soul food.   Kind of a scary location but if you want real southern bbq & smoked meaty ribs this is the place.  The owners are really friendly people and take great pride in their love of bbq & soul food and it really shows in their food.  Best ribs at the 1st annual Charity BBQ  Battle. I really liked her potato salad too."}
{"text":"This is a true mom and pop place that seems to have two menus.  BBQ is their specialty but they also sell tamales?  Whatever.  I've been here a few times and I have to say that the sauce is excellent but the meat can sometimes be dry.  Good flavors and reasonable prices, though."}
