{"text":"I love this place! Got the lasagna tonight--excellent. The stuffed meatball sandwich is dangerously delicious. The slaw can't be beat. I have enjoyed every menu item that I have tried. And the owners/staff are friendly and customer service oriented. Service is quick. And if you need a \"home cooked\" meal to go (busy moms take note) then this is the place for you. Very reasonable prices to boot!"}
{"text":"Everything is top notch at Eatery X Press!  Everyone is so kind and accommodating and the food is fabulous!  Today, I enjoyed the Oriental X press salad...the best asian type salad that I've had...fresh chicken and a sesame dressing to die for!  This was my 3rd visit, and I have been completely impressed with everything I've ordered!"}
{"text":"This place is a real find. I got the turkey and red pepper sandwich grilled and it was really great.  Next day tried the turkey bacon panini and it was also very good.  Plan on working my way through the rest of their sandwiches over the next few weeks.  Their cookies and cakes looked excellent too.  Very nice people and quality ingredients.  Just wish they had some seating, everything is to go."}
{"text":"I had the burrito dinner. The black bean refried beans were delicious. The meat in the burrito was a little under seasoned for my taste but, over all pretty good. The salsa could use a little work, under seasoned for my taste also. The owners are very friendly. The place it clean and has a very good atmosphere.  I tried a few samples of ham and potato salad out of the case. Those were very good as well. Better food than most around Stow."}
{"text":"The Key Lime Pie was to die for!
The Roast Beef and Green onion sandwich was very good.
The owner is really nice, they have a pastry and deli/cheese counter.
I can't wait to go back and trying everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Just got sandwiches and a piece of banana cake from here for lunch today, and we are impressed. My Bacon, Guacamole & Grilled Cheese blew me away. Lots of bacon and lots of ripe tomatoes made this sandwich a winner for me. The husband had the Classic Italian, also great, and my daughter the Crab cake bagel special. We really liked them all.  To top it all off, we took a piece of banana cake to share, and all we can say is, \"WOW\". So moist & full of banana flavor!  Since we live a little further away, we wish they had seating so that our sandwiches were warmer, but we will be back."}
{"text":"1st time in. Just a little corner store. Cannot eat in. Have to carry out. Met Jack and Pam. Pam is the Chef. Got the Cucumber veggie wrap. It was delicious. Huge and filling. I will definitely go back and try more menu items. 

While I waited for my sandwich to be made they had me try some of their homemade salads. Also delicious. 

Honestly nothing like a Subway or Jimmy Johns, this is a family owned biz that cares about what they serve. A bit more expensive but worth it. 

I'll go back. Plus the pastries and dinners look great too."}
{"text":"Today I found a place where quality ingredients and service are paramount. I ordered the Turkey & Red Pepper Panini on rye. The turkey was flavorful, the cheese so creamy and the red pepper mayo really held everything together. This was the best sandwich I've had in years."}
{"text":"It was like taking a step back in the 1950's. They learn your name, make everything from scratch with high quality local ingredients and are the exact opposite of 99% of the chain places so common in Stow. They offered us free samples of the ham salad while we waited for our sandwiches to be made. My wife and I don't even usually like ham salad. I mean, it's fine. But would never ever buy it or choose it over anything else. Well, it might be one of the best things I ever ever tasted. Our sandwiches were great too! Turkey-delphia was amazing. They even use Great Harvest bread. Mmm"}
{"text":"Wow, from the first bite of my spicy pastrami sandwich it was a flavor explosion.  From the sharp flavor of the rye and the Cole slaw then the creamy horseradish mayo the sandwich was a sensory overload.  In a good way.  The bread was grilled just right with crunch but not hard.  The core slaw was tasty and crispy not soggy.  I enjoyed every bite.  The only slight negative was that the pastrami was overshadowed.  Only a few slices of meat was included and was lost among the other flavors.  If your a carnivour you might be a little hungry but your taste buds won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time for lunch. Amazing food, excellent service. The family that owns and runs this spot are extremely nice and I always chat with them for a few minutes every time I come in."}
{"text":"It has been 6 months since I've  had the time to stop in and enjoy real food and good old fashioned customer service...my opinion still remains the same, the husband & wife duel are amazing & always interesting to talk with. 
  Today I finally got to try their Italian wedding soup & a bag of New Orleans style kettle chips- you can't go wrong with either. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to pick out tons of onion & celery chunks like I do @ most places. And my husband loved their German chocolate cupcake so much that he didn't even share, lol."}
{"text":"We ordered a pie from here a few weeks ago, and ended up picking up lunch when we picked up our pie. We all loved our food. The meatball sandwiches were delicious. The pie was for a birthday, and was a huge success. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped here this evening for a meal we could take with us to the park for can impromptu picnic.  This was a delicious choice!  The sandwich he chose looked amazing,  and the seasoned fries he got with it were very tasty. I got a yummy Oriental salad...great dressing, topped with lots of candied almonds. Literally could hear this super nice lady in the back freshly preparing our food. While waiting we selected chocolaty, decadent cupcakes for dessert. Very rich and I ALMOST couldn't finish it but I managed,  somehow.  Apparently they have different choices for dinner each day and you can call ahead if you plan to pick up, say, on your way home. 
It seems a slight bit pricey but you won't complain about the \"extra\" buck or two you paid to get quality food served by friendly folks who seem genuinely glad you are there. Will definitely stop here again!"}
