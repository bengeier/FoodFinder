{"text":"This is one very special restaurant.  We eat here frequently; if we could, we'd eat every meal here.  The food is delicious, well portioned and reasonably priced.  The salad bar is very fresh and kept that way.  The waitresses are friendly and prompt to take your order; respond quickly to any request you make.  If time allows, the chef will personally come - greet his guests and check on how they enjoyed their meals.  The restaurant is always clean, including the newly decorated restrooms.  Please try Mentor Family Restaurant, @Rt 615 (Center St) & Tyler Blvd -- across from CLASSIC & Speedway Gas.  If you come once, you'll become regulars like us & so many others !!!"}
{"text":"Good diner food at pretty good prices. Service was attentive and friendly. Could have been a little cleaner but I was there right after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Great little place with good service to boot.  Don't be afraid to try the specials ... the stuffed french toast is incredible!  Haven't had a bad experience yet :-)"}
{"text":"Cheap food that tastes good! Nice salad bar too!! 4 people ate lunch for 28$ what a deal!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, Delicious food and great looking restaurant, Very clean!!! Had chicken wraps and bacon cheddar tots, so yummy!!! Great job to the cooks!! Servers very nice and checked on us often. Big thank you to this Denny's team."}
{"text":"This place was amazing the prices are responsible and the portion are huge 
Great service"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious the salad bar is fresh and the staff is very friendly makes you feel at home.  The portions are Very generous, and if you live in the area look for coupons that come in the mail and the magazines they always have coupons.    Been here several times for both breakfast and dinner, very affordable especially if you use the coupons."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service at a great price. The owner has done a good job at turning the place around. Would go back again for lunch for sure"}
{"text":"Just another mediocre restaurant with bland food.

My wife and I just ate there this evening after driving past it for quite awhile. My wife had a sandwich which she said was okay. I had the corned beef and latkas which was not good. The corned beef was dry and thinly sliced. I expected to have corned beef that was not from a deli counter rather something that was prepared there. The latka's (potato pancakes) had absolutely no flavor to them at all and were paper thin. The beef barley soup had no beef in the bowl I received and was less than luke warm. I would have to say that I only try a restaurant once and if it's bad I never go back. This one falls into the never go back category.

I see other reviews here that say the food is good, which I did see before coming here and I don't agree with them based on this meal I had today."}
{"text":"My family and me were driving cross country on a long road trip and came in here because of the Yelp reviews. 

We came in for breakfast because it seems like from all the reviews that was the best meal to experience here, and I can agree.

I had the Greek omelette, my wife had a vegetarian omelette and our kids had the cheese almonds offer for kids menu. The portions are huge especially for the kids portions which looked exactly the same size portion of mine.

Almost came with a large portion of homemade hash potatoes which were really nicely. My only complaint about the quality of the food, when it came to the kids' omelette was that the restaurant uses cheese whiz in the cheese omelette instead of real cheese. 

That being said the wait staff was excellent, friendly and quick. They were really attentive to our needs and were great with our kids. The kids got their own cool little kids cup with a lid and a straw and when we asked for extra water and kids cups they gave a seconds of the cool kids cops. You don't see that very often in restaurants.

Oddly enough there are a lot of breakfast options in the city of Mentor but I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"This will be an unusual review.  I haven't written one like it.  This has to do with the all you can eat fish places that we go to with regularity - Mentor Family Restaurant, Lakeshore Eatery, Mama Roberto's and Manhattan Deli.  

The fish tastes great at all of these places and the price is not unreasonable.  All give a good portion on the first plate.  It's thereafter that we have an issue.  One piece every 20 minutes - some a little better, some a little worse.  Those that ask how many you want, take longer.  

The management and owners need to take some things into consideration.  For our family, one person gets AYCE and the rest of us order from the menu.  That means 1-4 profit makers in our party of up to five.  We also come in at other times and spend money.  

The slow down only serves to make our fish eater stubborn and he isn't afraid to tell the wait staff what he wants, especially when he isn't getting it.  I'm sure the wait staff hate AYCE fish.  Tonight we had a different tactic to the slow down.  They ran out of fish. I have very rarely been at a place that runs out of anything.

I am sure we are not the only ones disappointed in this situation.  Again, I ask that management take some time to rethink how we can make everyone happy.

Copying this to the other restaurants listed.  Don't think I am singling out any one place.

Now I am going in search of other places that do AYCE and hoping for the best."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Country breakfast sandwich was delicious and filling. Their sausage gravy was fabulous. Greek omelette was delicious, too and their tzatziki sauce was totally in point. Spectacular service by Roy and our greeter. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant reached out to me after I left a review about receiving caffeinated coffee. The guy could not have been nicer. He apologized for the oversight and took responsibility. He was very sincere and you can tell he's an involved owner/operator.  I wish them the best of luck!!"}
{"text":"There is zero competition to the ABSOLUTE BEST Restaurant in the Mentor/Painesville area. Hands down. David, the owner is a fantastic, seasoned chef, and the food is always over the top in flavor and quality. I've eaten here every week for the past 6 months and I'm dumbfounded as to how the dining room isn't always packed. This is a great place to eat any time of day, I highly recommend becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"We had great food and the service was exceptional. The salad bar and soup ere one of the best. My husband had the cardinal burger and he loved it"}
{"text":"Went here this sat and I wanted somewhere different than my normal spots and have just moved back to mentor after many many years was disappointed Perkins was gone They had the best pancakes so I tried mentor family restaurant  I was skeptical the old Pizza Hut building and the inside decor was just a little bit kind of drab and depressing for my tastes I was glad they served breakfast all day. And I ordered eggs Benedict Waimea's French toast sausage and coffee eggs Benedict came with home fries. When my order arrived it looked pretty good and was pleasantly surprised. Coffee was pretty good MOST PLACES don't have very good coffee but I like mine realy strong. I was realy hungry so I dug into my french toast with strawberries French toast looked pretty average but was again pleasantly surprised was pretty good and they actually gave you strawberries not just one or 2 but enough I didn't need syrup it was a strawberry topping type stuff but still it was good and a good portion sausage was also a delightful surprise it was very good tasted like real sausage not over cooked and dry but juicy flavorful and a heck of a lot better than most places including  The big red breakfast chain \"Down on the Farm\"  tried my eggs Benedict and it was awesome eggs were perfect ham was good English muffins were good and the holandaise sauce was great it tasted to me like they actually made it I could be wrong but it sure tasted like it ! Did not taste like the frozen or concentrated stuff in the plastic tub that you add water and boil. it was very very good! And they weren't skimpy on that either! I'm not much of a home fries person but there's were quite tasty! Service was great and when I got my bill I thought it was going to sting cuz food this good doesn't come cheap! But again I was very pleasantly surprised not bad at all! I will definitely be back again! I hope there lunch and dinner is as good as breakfast and I'll be there ALOT!"}
{"text":"Okay so I need to first appologize to this establishment!! I wrote a review and named the wrong restaurant. So I thought i had better go and check this place out. Oh I am so grateful we did go!! What a nice nice restaurant. The food was amazing!!! Just a small diner with great food! I had the chicken which was sooo tasty! My grandson had their burger which he LOVED!! The salad bar was nice and clean. Sad to say they were our of rice pudding of which we heard was the best around!! The wedding soup was to die for if you go and dont order that you will be missing out! Our waitress was so awesome! She helped us order the usual favorites of others which were right on spot for us! I have to say that our food was HOT when served. Not like other places where it sits and gets cold...all of our dinners were hot which we loved.
  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how great this place is. Employees who are enthusiastic and happy. Instantly greeted when I walked in.  I called and asked about the fish fry before going, I received a detailed enthusiastic response about the fish fry. This made me WANT to get there and get a taste! My beverage never went empty before a refill arrived. The food was piping hot, just the way I love it. Clean atmosphere and easy parking.. the fish was delicious and came with soup and a salad bar. All delicious"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Nice place. Would definitely eat there again if I'm ever back in Mentor. 

Stuffed French toast with strawberries was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Just dont like sitting there for 30 min and wait for it each time.
Still a great place."}
{"text":"Had breakfast today. I love eggs Benedict, they make a pretty good one.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  My kids also got kids meals.  They were very happy with their meals as well.  The portions were good size and the food was really good.  We have added this to our rotation of breakfast Resturaunts."}
{"text":"Just an OK spot. I had the Corned Beef Latikas Platter, the corned beef was good but it was overall pretty greasy. They also give you four sauces with it by default which is pretty wasteful - I only ended up using the horseradish.

My wife got the Hand Cut Rib Eye Steak which was pretty expensive at 8oz for $12.50. To their credit it was actually cooked medium but it definitely needed the A1 they brought to the table with it. 

Maybe it's a good breakfast joint but I found the dinner options limited. Thankfully George's Kitchen is much more local to me - a somewhat similar place that has much more variety, cheaper prices, and better food."}
{"text":"I was having my car serviced in the area and decided to try this semi-new restaurant for brunch.  This place has been open for a little over a year and it seems like they've worked out any kinks that undoubtedly come with being new.  Now, as its name suggests, this is a family restaurant and my expectation is tasty, no frills and hearty food.

I ordered the Denver omelet with egg whites.  It was a hearty sized omelet and balanced well with ham, onions, peppers and American cheese. Omelets come with home fries.  They we're beautifully cooked, but terribly unseasoned. I added quite a bit of salt and pepper.

I also ordered a half order of biscuits and sausage gravy.  First, the half order was very nicely portioned and could satisfy someone looking for a smaller potion.  The biscuit itself was very nice: tender and buttery.  The sausage gravy had a very velvety consistency and meaty, but--like the home fries--was under seasoned.  Also, this is served with home fries, but I asked for grits instead, which they were happy to substitute.  The grits, as expected were plainly cooked offering a blank palate for savory or sweet pursuits.

For the food you get, position size and quality, the price point is excellent.  You can eat well here for under $15.  Lastly, the staff here is excellent: the service is kind, competent and swift.  I enjoyed my experience here and would highly recommend you try this place out, especially if you're looking to support local small business."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good the coffee okay and the service was fast and efficient but the server wasny really friendly she wasnt rude either just sort of felt like she didnt wany 2 help us but i give all places 2 chances so i will be back some day and hopefully will change this review"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars but really about a3 &1/2 , clean, ok decor, freshly renovated in past year or so. Staff was nice, we ordered the veal parm, my suggestion would be avoid it, processed probably frozen had an old or just off taste, both of us sent it back. I got the chicken parm, Helen got eggplant, pretty good would try here again very reasonable prices cheaper than mr. Hero, lol, overall an ok experience"}
{"text":"We stayed in Mentor as a pit stop on a road trip and checked out the restaurant because of the great yelp reviews - we were not disappointed. We had eggs with corned beef hash and country fried steak, respectively. Bother were above average. What we loved? The fried provolone skewers... yum!!! Definitely recommend this place as an outstanding alternative to the chains."}
{"text":"We found these guys in Yelp as we were driving through Indiana to Vermont. Great fresh salad bar even just before closing. Huge servings, but more importantly very good home cooked food.  Friendly staff including the chef / owner made us feel welcome. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast. Absolutely delicious. Service was wonderful. Nice variety on menu. If your looking for a tasty breakfast then definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, wait staff was friendly and warm. Salad bar was so fresh and with actual good ingredients. Breakfast served all day and the lunch and dinner items have a pretty good variety of dishes. Hubby ordered Chicken and Pierogies and I had the Two Egg Breakfast with Corned Beef Hash (with sausage gravy over my home fries). Both were delicious. Plan on coming back here often for weekend breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"It's been a few weeks since we visited Mentor Family Restaurant but I still wanted to post a review. We were looking for a place to get dinner after an Indians ball game. We arrived at the restaurant shortly after 8:00 on a Friday night and they close at 9:00. We weren't expecting much but we were pleasantly surprised! Our server, Roy, was the best! I ordered Smothered Chicken and my husband ordered Grilled Chicken and Pierogis. Both meals were delicious and HOT. We also ate from the salad bar and it was still well stocked. The only way you could tell they were closing soon was they were busy cleaning around us but we never felt rushed. Roy made sure to take our dirty plates and fill our water glasses. We decided we would be returning to try other menu items before we even left! Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot at reasonable prices. The cooler with all the desserts looked impressive too. I almost got tiramisu after my omelette. I always like supporting local businesses over a chain and these guys make it easy."}
{"text":"Staff was prompt. Salad bar was good,  meatloaf was awful- taste like it came out of the freezer didn't want the doggy bag that was offered. My husband had the cod which he said was good. Have no plans to return"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic that we received... The reason that this isn't getting a five-star is because of the salad bar... Last time we went the salad bar had some major issues... First most of the lettuce was not fresh... You can tell because of bits of the lettuce being black... If I had to take a guess it probably hadn't been changed in terms of cleaned and probably about a day or two... Or the refrigerator that they have was not working properly and not keeping the lettuce itself at proper temperature.. the second thing that I noticed about the salad bar is that a lot of the things that were served on the salad ( for example the chocolate pudding ) was spoiled... We brought this up to the attention of the person that was looking at the salad bar and told her that it didn't quite taste right... Her only reaction was really? She didn't change it she didn't even taste it to confirm what we already knew... I will be back but I definitely will not be getting the salad bar.. definitely a bad experience on that one"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service, and good food. It was our first time there and we will be back. They even gave us a $5 coupon for our next visit."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for lunch in between hockey games. This place has a homelike feeling, the staff was friendly and service was good. 

The salad bar reminded me of a 1980's style salad bar and that was nostalgic. Nothing fancy, just your basic fixin's. 

For lunch I had the homemade meatloaf and mashed potatoes, it was just okay, but there was A LOT of it! My daughter had chicken noodle soup, which she absolutely loved and the chicken tender platter. She enjoyed her meal very much, and I'd say mine was just okay. 

I would definitely return bc they have a nice selection on the menu and it was very clean & friendly!"}
{"text":"My family absolutely loves this place! Extremely family-friendly, great service (Roy is awesome!), simple home-cooked food, and the salad bar is clean and full with a variety of options. Tuesday is \"kids eat free\" night, so that tends to be our go-to dinner. I've had the corned beef/latke platter, smothered chicken, and chicken & pierogi platter...all were fantastic! If you're looking for an inexpensive family dinner, this is your spot! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and myself had breakfast there this morning and both ordered the meat lover's skillet. The food was very very bland. Had to add lots of salt and pepper. (I don't ever add salt) The meat was very little diced up pieces obviously leftover from something else. (very dry with no flavor ) Eggs over easy were done right at least. My husband asked for rye toast, I said white. I will give you that rye and white sound similar so yes I got rye also. The problem was I received one piece of toast and everyone else in restaurant (including my husband ) got two. That was the only thing with taste. We won't go back."}
{"text":"As someone who comes in from Columbus to visit their parents, let's face it: most of Mentor's restaurants are \"meh\" in comparison. I read good reviews then I'm constantly disappointed. 

HOWEVER, this place is awesome. Every time I have came here (which is frequent when I visit my older adult friends/family/mentors to catch up) the service has been outstanding and the food (I'm usually always there for breakfast, because...bacon. Duh.) has always been hot and cooked fresh to order.

I'll be bringing my old man, aka Dad, up here this weekend for lunch to discuss normal father-daughter conversation: stocks mainly. I really enjoy this place and I know I can always come here for a good meal when I'm home. 

The owners and staff should all be very proud. Please tip them generously when you're here--they deserve it!"}
{"text":"Good family restaurant. Simple food. Decent menu. Prices are low. Seems to be a busy place."}
