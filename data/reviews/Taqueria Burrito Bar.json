{"text":"Very bland, very starchy burrito. The meat is plain and the rice overcooked, and there's little in the way of interesting herbs, sauces, or salsa to liven it up. Charging extra for guacamole (especially when it's under-ripe) is never welcome either. Portion size was decent, but I suppose that's easy to manage when your ingredients are so average. I can think of a dozen burrito places in Toronto I'd rather eat at."}
{"text":"Decent enough take out Burritos in Cumberland Terrace. On the route along the subterranean path from Starbucks and the cheap Shoe Store to Holt Refrew. Once you have to make the turn left toward American Apparel, there it is across from the toy and games store.   They have whole wheat, I tried the vegetarian, as they were out of fish and the shrimp looked suspect. An employee scoops burrito toppings from a ravaged steam table and assembles your lunch ala Subway Sandwiches. Next guy gives you choice of sauce. Spicy, is not really that spicy, you may want to ask for extra. Vegetarian gets guac without the additional charge.    Nothing Fancy, Cash Only. Everything is $5.99. Carb-o-phobes there is some sort of burrito-bowl option with or without the tortilla.    Overall, its ok. Cannot complain about cheap lunch options in this 'hood but I would not go out of your way to try it. Chino Loco's still KILLS, SLAUGHTERS actually, this place and the Church location is only a 15 min walk away."}
{"text":"Ditto on all positive points mentionedl thus far by other yelpers. An extra thumbs up for the fish filling, which is a deep-fried battered fillet (which  nicely but deliciously negates any healthy claims). All the ingredients seem to somehow be packed evenly in the burrito so you don't get bites that are either only mostly lettuce or mostly meat filling. If I have to throw any sort of shade, it's to deride their lack of hot sauce options. Even a choice of fresh chopped jalapenos would have been nice then again, they exist to serve the working lunchtime masses, and not so much tastebud masochists like me.   I kind of hope they don't open up in my neighbourhood lest I give up grocery shopping and cooking for myself ever."}
{"text":"$6.77  The last time lunch cost me that much was in my high school cafeteria back in 1998.  And it was disgusting, when I ate it, which was not often.  I always waited for my friends to give me the nod to proceed.  The nod meant that no one put anything extra in the school's lunch.  Extra being spit, snot, garbage...I mean really, upper middle class kids stuck in a suburbia really have no shame and nothing better to do.  No nod meant I left the line and went to Subway.  There is a kiosk between the Bay-Cumberland and Holt Renfrew Centres. It's subground level, beneath the escalators that bring you to street level where the Swarovski is.  I have smelt it for several months now.  Taquer√≠a is not the nicest take-out joint. It has a dishevelled feeling. You order, and then they kind of slop your food together. It's all sitting there - premade, but well made (for fast food).ast, dirty food.     Doesn't sound all that appetizing, but imagine my surprise when I get back to my office, turn on the TV (yes, we have a flat screen in our office for personal use) and bite into my taco.  Mmmm, tasty.    Your choices are: burrito, burrito bowl (for anyone still on the Atkins diet), tacos (hard or soft, I like it hard), salad, or nacho platter.  Then you pick your meat (chicken, beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, fish and shrimp) and toppings (four salsas, cheese, beans, sour cream, lettuce).  All for $5.99 plus tax (and plus $0.75 if you want guacamole.)  I had the hard tacos - shrimp, chicken and pulled beef.  All three were good, but the beef was my least favourite.  A little too chewy/stringy and salty.  The lettuce was crisp (void of brown spots), the tomatoes were fresh, the salsa was flavourful (though spicy is not so spicy), and the cheese smelled and tasted just fine.  But honestly, $6.77 for three full loaded tacos.   I'm really not about to give you some fancy critique.  It's cheap.  It's good."}
{"text":"The pico de gallo, my default when picking a salsa, tasted like unripe tomatoes with cumin dumped in, nothing else.  Burrito contained too much bland rice filler."}
{"text":"Working in Yorkville, this place is a lunch time staple and a welcome addition to the overpriced alternatives scattered throughout the Bay-Bloor area. It's fresh, it's healthy(ish) and it's a reasonably priced. And it's pretty darn delicious (depending on what you choose).  I would recommend the pulled steak (second would be the pulled pork followed by chicken and shrimp - both chicken and shrimp are a little bland from my experience - I have yet to try the fish). I generally always go for the burrito, but they offer a variety of choices ranging from tacos to salad to nachos.   The standard burrito build is rice, your choice of re-fried or black beans, grilled veggies (mixed peppers and onions mostly), mild or medium sauce, both  tomato and corn salsas, cheese, lettuce and sour cream. I don't recommend skipping the rice as this can lead to a very soggy burrito. They also offer an above average homemade guacamole for a $0.75 charge.  The service is always quick, the staff are always friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious. They also feature a customer appreciation card - your 10th burrito is always free, just remember to get your stamp.  Cash only - open weekdays during the lunch hours."}
{"text":"Tasty pork filling. Nice portions. Good guac. Well worth $5.99"}
{"text":"They give you a lot of food here. Pretty good options for take-out burritos - and they do burrito bowls if you don't want the wraps. It's assembly-line style ordering: type of tortitlla, type of meat (I've had pulled pork), toppings like veggies, cheese, guac (EXTRA $$), sour cream, and type of salsa(warning: the hot IS hot).  They get it out for you really quickly. Even when there's a big line snaking through the hallway of the underground mall, you won't have to wait long. Lots of folks behin the counter moving efficiently.  I wouldn't call it a healthy lunch, but it's pretty good, and convenient."}
{"text":"worst burrito I've had in my life. I mean.. how to you mess up a burrito? I little lime, a little salt, a little cilantro?? I had a vegetarian burrito yesterday, it was completely tasteless. There were ingredients in the burrito that should have had taste all on their own, but I coudnt even finish it and Im not a picky eater."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian burrito. Food was mushy and tasteless -- except for a boatload of onions.  Portion size is generous and the service is great, but the food just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"This little burrito place is tucked away in the underground beneath the bustling Yonge/Bloor corner.  I found it while wandering the halls on a rainy day and returned for a shrimp burrito.    The burrito size was pretty massive for a small eater like myself.  I may get the bowl option next time as I ate 3/4 of the burrito and was completely stuffed.  The burrito itself was tasty, fresh and very filling.  A nice lunch option.  All menu items (burrito, salad, bowls, etc) are under $10.  No seating in the immediate area but there is a food court just around the corner with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Sadly, it appears Taqueria es meurte. They moved out of their cramped space under Cumberland Terrace, to bigger birghter digs just South of Bloor. If that location even opened I'd be surprised. It is now Miss Korea, object of derision among Bi Bim Bap-loving Yelpers."}
{"text":"A solid burrito right here folks.  Taqueria may be small but has a range of options for you to choose from. They have burritos, bowls, tacos, nacho platters, salads, and vegetarian options. The choice of protein is standard with chicken, steak, pork, fish, and shrimp. Toppings are also straight forward. As with most places, guac is $0.75 extra.  As with any burrito place I'm making a first trip to, I had a pork burrito. The burrito was good, but not anything to knock my socks off. The pork was juicy and the rice had a good flavor. The spicy salsa added some warmth but doesn't blow you away with heat. I appreciate that they are touting themselves as a healthy option and haven't loaded everything with salt, but there could be a dash more salt to add some more flavor.  The owner here obviously cares about his business. He seemed to be busy rushing around getting the final prep done for the pending lunch rush but still took the time to chat me up for a few minutes.  Taqueria is only open for lunch on weekdays so plan your trip carefully. They open at 11 am and are very popular so expect a line."}
