{"text":"Tried out this new restaurant with a group of 7 friends, so we were able to share the entire food menu, minus the quebec cheese plate. 

First, we had heard this place had a solid bar, with a solid craft beer selection and great cocktails. While the cocktail menu was very promising, most drinks were extremely disappointing. Most people did not want to finish their cocktails, and we switched to red wine, a safer bet. 

We started with oysters, and while they weren't bad, they were far from great. That's when I started suspecting this place would be a let down, considering it's a market-food type restaurant with an emphasis on seafood and it had merely average oysters. 

While service was alright, the food was mediocre. None of the dishes were memorable, and my friend made a mental note that he was craving McDonald's, if you see what I mean. 

Didn't try desserts. Prices were fair. 

You can do much better in the area"}
{"text":"Bouffe très ordinaire. Service trop maniéré et prétentieuse pour la faible qualité de la nourriture.  Magnifique design et belle ambiance."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails! Very diverse choices, professionnal and personalized service. Seems like the bartender knew exactly what I like! Even the owner was very friendly. Food was also up to our expectations. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The good: beautiful room, amazing bar, and good cocktails. Management seems to want to fix the issues

The bad: at least the night we were there the service and the food were both off. We waited 20m to get a drink order in, and by the 1 hour mark had only just put our food order in. It was one of those situations where tables full of guests with empty glasses and no food make eye contact with each other while competing to try to wave a server over - stressful and not fun.

In terms of food, we tried the, 

Fried chicken:  almost no chicken, just chunks of batter with drops of sour buttermilk on top (I get it, you're deconstructing the ingredients, but it just tasted bad). Also, why does anyone think grilled lettuce is a good idea. It should be impossible to screw up fried chicken!

Tomatoes and burrata: another impossible to screw up plate - all it needs is high quality ingredients, which they had, but... while the tomatoes were really great, there was literally 2 tablespoons of burrata on the plate. Just two tiny little pieces which they then try to make up for with some foamed ricotta which was tasty, but the whole thing just felt like they were going overboard trying to control food costs

Fried cauliflower: was like a made at home cauliflower tempura - kinda soggy and oily tasting, and weirdly accompanied by more sliced raw cauliflower.  It was neither high concept or delicious so I just didn't get it. Also this dish arrived cold, but you might starve to death if you send something back so we just ate it. 

Ricotta cavatelli:  I found this to be totally tasteless, plus the pasta was overcooked and mushy. The table seemed to like it though so maybe it was just me being cranky by this point. 

Shishito peppers: ugh, they ran out of shishito peppers and tried to pass off grilled baby bell peppers as what we ordered. This one is a huge warning sign to me about the future of the restaurant. If they think shishito peppers are so exotic their guests won't notice, hoo boy...

Anyway, the staff and management were nice, and seemed receptive to our slightly bitchy feedback (sorry, I was still hungry!), and I do believe them that some of this just is growing pains since they're only a few months old. Hopefully they can step up both their service and their food quality because that beautiful room won't sustain poor quality of the other two for very long... 

We'll likely come back in a few months and see if they've fixed things, it's such a pretty spot i do hope it succeeds..."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going here for date night. We always sit at the bar and enjoy their amazing cocktails (they make some of the best drinks in the city here!) & then share all the appetizers and a dessert. Rarely do we order mains as the appetizers are so great! My favourite appetizers are the hamachi and the corn (in a foamy , fluffy soup texture)& lobster. Yum. The desserts here are a standout too. Last time we went we shared the After Eight (pic below) - delicious. Highly recommend this place for groups or couples."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful, I can't believe it used to be a garage. It now looks like a beer garden. 

Regarding the food, it was very good, we had the origami of hamachi, which was good, but not the greatest. Then I had the magret de canard, which was amazing. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend had the joue de boeuf, which I didn't particularly like, it felt like it had been slightly overcooked in the sauce.  For dessert, I got the chocolate dessert and he had the dessert du jour, which is a seasonal special: maple themed dessert. If you have the chance to get the maple themed dessert, please take it, as it was amazing. The portions are medium sizes.

The restaurant wasn't overly booked, so it was great as it wasn't too loud so we don't have to scream to talk to the other people. You can really have a nice dinner. 

The staff was really nice, however, it took close to 20 minutes for them to take our initial order, that was the only negative thing I have to say regarding my experience at Perles & Paddock. Afterward, the service was great. Beside the only initial 20 minutes wait, this restaurant is great. 
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing

Walk inside and you will fall in love with the beautiful interior of this restaurant.  You would not know from the outside how beautiful the interior is. 

Sit at the bar or a table and prepare to have the most amazing food and drinks.  They balance different ingredients to create a fantastic experience for your taste buds.  

Service is warm and friendly.  The owner is usually on hand to welcome guests.  

I would rate this as one of the hidden gems in Montreal.  

Give it a try and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Garage look from outside (it was a garage before), inside beautiful modern looking restaurant. The most amazing service I have seen for very long time. The host takes our jacket and then brings us to our seat by pulling our chairs. Our waitress was amazing. She is friendly, helpful and really sweet. She took our pictures, and she even asked if the pictures were ok... she can take again. For brunch, we ordered cappuccinos, avocado toast with salmon and egg poached, sweet potato pancakes, chicken waffles with maple syrup and homemade cola (sugar from sugar cane). Every single dish were beautifully presented; and the taste were incredible. In conclusion: beautiful restaurant; perfect service; delicious food! Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"An amazing spot in Griffintown for amazing food, cocktails and service. I've come here for both dinner and brunch and have yet to eat something I don't like. The restaurant itself is lovely, a bright yet simple decor takes over what used to be a a garage. With a central bar and private dining room in the back, it's the perfect spot for any occasion. We tried the Hamachi, beef tartare and roasted cauliflower with the panna cotta for dessert. The menu is very allergy friendly and the food that is missing certain allergens is just as amazing as the other items on the menu. For brunch I tried the tartelette with salmon gravlax and avocado; a great balance of salty, savoury and a touch of sweet. I also tried the brioche, not to be confused with a cinnamon bunch, this thick bread comes with two in house made jams and fleur de sel butter. As for the cocktails, everything from the cocktail lists to the Caesars to a classic Old Fashioned are sure to be a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Really unique. The issue is the portions are very small. The food is good but there needs to be more of it. The price would be fine if the portions were larger."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this 1 star is for the greeting I received on Sunday morning. I went inside at 9:50am and asked for a table for 2. I was told \"we're not open yet\". As I was waiting for a friend, I went back outside and waited with another girl who also arrived early and was told the same thing. If it were up to me, I would have gone next door to Spanel. How hard is it to say \"welcome, please have a seat until we open at 10:00\"."}
{"text":"Walked in late on Saturday night as I was craving one of their cocktails and we got to chat with the owner when we noticed the different menu. This guy listens to his clients! They took the tasting menu away and beefed up their bar menu to offer more generous portions for the same price. We ordered oysters (lucky lime, yum) as well as a tempura cauliflower entree which we easily shared. The flavour was spot on, perfectly cooked and the crunchy tempura batter on the outside, with a cauliflower purée, and marinated cauliflower stems, was just plain delicious! 

The service was as spot on as the first time even though this place was packed at this late hour. Why? Because their kitchen closes near 1 am offering great food way after most restaurants have closed shop. 

As always, the cocktails were just crazy good! As for their wine selection, thanks to the knowledgeable sommelier, you will surely find an amazing wine if the innovative cocktails aren't your thing."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here and had gotten the tasting menu. All the dishes in the tasting menu were delicious. Definitely a place to check out when you are visiting."}
{"text":"Elegant and simple decor, it felt like we were in an outdoor garden when we were inside. We were seated at the bar (by the indoor tree) and the bar chef was amazing at helping us choose a drink and dessert. The sotolon punch is out of this world! I highly recommend it, as well as the seasonal maple dessert which was fantastic. Great staff, great service, great drinks, overall an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner and drinks here on a Saturday night. What a cute place! The decor of the restaurant is very zen and elegant . It's white everywhere with lots of plants.

The drinks here are pretty strong!! That's what I want from a bar! They have a few interesting cocktails. I started with a cocktail called Le foie gras because I am obsessed with foie gras. It didn't taste like it though :( The cocktail contained of a liquor called Armagnac with foie gras and sugar. It surprisingly tasted a bit like an old fashioned. There was even a slice of orange in it. My boyfriend had the Seasonal Julep cocktail. It was a bit like a mojito but it contained gin, tarragon , cucumber, salicorne, white pepper, mint and sugar. Next I had the Verdita cocktail which reminded me a bit of a Bloody Caesar. I ordered it with gin because I like gin and the waiter recommended it but you can choose another type of alcohol if you wish. It  was like a veggie smoothie with tomato, parsley, cucumber, celery and it was rimmed with a chili type powder. It was good but I prefer a regular Bloody Caesar. I also tried my boyfriend's A Night in Tunisia cocktail and it was so refreshing! It contained pineapple rum, watermelon, ras al hanout (North African spice), sea salt and lemon.

Everything we had was great! For food we shared the salmon bio entree. It had some cream with beets and cucumber watermelon hybrid. On top of the fresh salmon there was some crunchy stuff... almost like Rice Krispies. Then we shared two mains the duck and the chicken. Both were very good but the duck was the highlight. The duck was very flavourful and came with a side of string beans mixed with mushrooms and blueberries. It's a very salty dish. The chicken was in a form of a roll and deep fried on the outside. There was a yellowish sauce but I don't know what was in it. The chicken needed the sauce otherwise it would have been a bit bland.

Lastly the dessert was amazing! It was pretty light and it was not too sweet. I don't usually eat dessert but I could have eaten it all by myself it was that good! We ordered the figues and pecan. Basically there was a thin circular layout of graham crackers with figues on top with a crunchy sugary layer and white cream on top and on the side there was pecan ice cream. 

I would come back."}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis juin 2017, ancien garage transformé en restaurant/bar et franchement, c'est réussi ! Superbe décor, ambiance et bouffe ! En rentrant, on observe la beauté des lieux tout blanc, les luminaires art déco modernes, les plantes vertes, le bar, etc. J'adore les endroits designs/architecturaux comme ceux-ci et les entrepreneurs/propriétaires qui choisissent de faire des efforts, de faire du beau à Montréal. Bravo ! Nous sommes donc venus pour le brunch du dimanche vers les 11h, pas trop rempli, parfait, pas d'attente. On nous installe à une table près du bar, on prend notre commande, j'ai pris le homard/bénédictine (24$) + américano (3$). Résultat, bon brunch, mon plat était délicieux, bon service de notre serveuse. Total pour 3 personnes (3 plats + 3 cafés) avec taxes/service, 103,98$. Mes invités étaient très satisfaites et heureuses de découvrir cette jolie adresse. Je veux revenir pour un 5@7 et essayer le menu du soir. Une belle perle dans Griffintown ! 

5/5 visité en mars 2018"}
{"text":"An incredible dining experience. In humble settings, the service was wonderful. Starting with creative cocktails, balanced flavors in unexpected combinations. My tartare appetizer was entertaining to the palate. Main course of arctic char was cooked to perfection with crisp skin, contrasting with white beans and chestnuts. The mango kiwi puree on the edge of the plate added just the right amount of acidity to brighten up the entire plate. Dessert with citrus flower had a crunchy meringue surrounding preserved lemons. Lovely. 
I sampled my wife's vegan meal and was amazed. Sunchokes, quinoa in almond butter. It was tasty and rich -- never believe that vegan has to be a sacrifice. The entire evening was charmed."}
