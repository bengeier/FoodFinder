{"text":"Away from the hubbub of the Annex and Little Korea, sushi joints become fewer and further between. On a relatively quiet stretch of Bloor West, between Dovercourt and Dufferin, sits Mazz Sushi.

An unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years, Mazz Sushi has been one of the few sushi options for Bloorcourt and Bloordale residents. Each time I visit, I am amazed by how bustling a place it is with the constant turning of tables and the rapid fire filling of take-out bags.

On a recent weeknight excursion, the small dining room was full, with a great mix of students, parents with young children and older couples; a typical audience for Mazz. Soon the servers were trying to accommodate extra guests and pointing out that it would be a '10 to 15 minute wait' for a table.

Seated, with menus in hand, the server soon appeared with the tea that was barely just ordered. Mazz's tea is very earthy in flavour with a hint of barley. Moving on quickly to another table, he left us to continue to ponder the menus, not returning for quite some time.

Upon his return, we quickly placed our order for various maki and sashimi hoping that the busyness of the place wouldn't slow the normally lightning-quick service.

After a moment, he returned with a bowl of congee and an amuse-bouche of marinated tofu. Don't be alarmed, these are Mazz's welcome dishes. I find the tofu pleasant enough, but the congee seems a little too heavy and porridge-like to start a meal.

Before these two were done, he was back again with the ubiquitous Miso soup and house salad. The soup was seasoned and flavourful with lots of nori and tofu. The salad was a small mixture of iceberg lettuce with some vegetable shavings and slices: by the book, but not out of this world.

Just as we were finishing our appetizers, the first of our rolls arrived. We ordered a Spicy Tuna maki: tuna mixed with crumbled tempura and hot sauce. My guest, not a fan of spicy food, likes Mazz's version, as she doesn't normally find it too spicy. Unfortunately this time they were a little too spicy for her. Good for me, but bad for her. A minor thing, but consistency means repeat business.

Next, the rest of our food arrived: a sashimi dinner and Dynamite roll. The sashimi dinner is always a joy at Mazz, and this time was no different. The plate usually contains a nice selection of tuna, white tuna, salmon and possibly mackerel, and always has more pieces then advertised. This time was no different, and the fish was very fresh. The only complaint, and I've found this happens quite regularly in Toronto, is that the white tuna was served too cold. The Dynamite roll was large, but a little tasteless; seemingly prepared in too much of a hurry, a couple of pieces unraveled and fell apart on the plate.

Overall, Mazz Sushi let us down a little on this visit. The staff seemed rushed and unable to provide the consistency that we have come to expect. Not once during our meal were we offered more tea, a slight unheard-of in a sushi restaurant. The food, although served quickly, wasn't up to their usual standards, and the wait to order was long. And although it remains quite inexpensive, the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system."}
{"text":"Great combos, good prices, friendly staff! All around first class."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! they have the best spicy tuna rolls i've ever had.They have excellent quality and fantastic prices for any area. To complain that some places should be cheaper because it's \"bloor & dufferin\" is insulting. I've been to a really fancy place on jane and it wasn't half as good and cost twice as much. The staff is friendly and not in your face forcing you to keep on ordering and they don't rush you out."}
{"text":"This place can do no wrong even when their service is slow and they have taken away tasty appetizers...but i still love it, best place I've been to in Toronto for sushi quality :D"}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch.  I live in the area and when I'm craving sushi I go here.  You always start off with a little tofu, congee and green tea with miso soup.  So delicious.  The sushi combo A is what I get and its 5 pieces of sushi with glass noodles, beans, salad and 6 California rolls (which are totally delcious at Mazz)
Try this place!  Such an inexpensive delicious lunch."}
{"text":"We`ve become regulars.  Very good atmosphere, nice setting for a neighbourhood sushi restaurant.  Food is good quality sushi, tempura is decent.  
It definitely seems to have turned into a trendy spot for the locals so there can be a wait, but it`s a solid local option for sushi."}
{"text":"Came here the other day with one other person for dinner based on the reviews on Yelp. I'm definitely glad we did. They started us off with a  complimentary amuse bouch (don't know Japanese word for it) including congee and miso marinated tofu. The sashimi seemed better quality than the all-you-can-eat places. The makis were made impeccably - they don't over roll them in rice. Service was attentive. And the bill was reasonably priced. Expect to pay more than you would at an all-you-can-eat."}
{"text":"Entered at 7:30 pm, seated immediately, ordered and place settings were brought right away. Complimentary congee and a tofu dish were brought.
Food was delicious and looked amazing. Informed waiter when he brought food that we were in a bit of a rush and could we please have separate bills brought when he got a chance and he took care of us right away.

I will definitely return here when I can, to fully enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"I came here the other day for lunch with my family. I ordered the 10pc sashimi and gyoza soup. The soup was delicious, so I'll give credit where it's due. 

However, the sashimi was obviously not fresh, it lacked any flavour and was almost crunchy. As another reviewer said, it tasted a few days old. I'm not messing around with raw fish; I took one bite and knew something was off, so I told our server that I wasn't satisfied with my dish. 

The issue wasn't even in the fish, it was in the attitude of the chef and server. I overheard a heated discussion from the kitchen, and when the server returned he insisted that there was nothing wrong with the fish, that it was freshly caught that morning (????) and that I would have to pay for half of the order. I've never once been to a restaurant that I wasn't able to send back a dish that was unsatisfactory. The server kept going on about how \"I don't know what real fresh fish tastes like\", and that the chef provides the \"best fish in the city\". I gave up with trying to reason with him and accepted to pay for half, even though I barely touched my plate. 

The server never once came back to quality check my family's dishes, but he came back to our table 2 more times to pester me with more excuses on behalf of the chef, even after settling the bill. It was so unbelievably arrogant, I would have returned if it weren't for this attitude. I suggest taking your money elsewhere, since they care more about the money than providing quality service."}
{"text":"While I have dined at Mazz before and my experience was neither great nor bad, my recent takeout experience has me questioning if it's worth going back. To begin with, it was like the staff was hell bent on having me pay more than I should (by continuously putting in the wrong amount into the card reader, then immediately walking away). 
The worst part, we were given about one teaspoon of soy sauce, haha I have never seen anything like it. A prank? Is soy sauce getting to be a really hot and coveted commodity that a sushi house can't spare a drip? 
Stingy is what."}
{"text":"This little neighbourhood sushi place is a gem. Forget Sushi on Bloor with its line ups and rude servers who can't wait to get you out and someone else in. The value here is fantastic. I am in Liberty and make the small trek with my husband regularly. The staff is friendly and very accommodating, I always change the set menu selections and it is never a problem. This is a great find. I love the scallop tempura...yum. Go, you will love it."}
{"text":"Slow service. Mediocre quality. They tend to throw in cucumber inside any maki so they save money. My \"lobster roll\" was made of cucumber, spicy sauce, avocado and probably 1/300 of a medium sized Lobster. Food looks like a bland mix of Korean and Japanese."}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi.

Only, they actually DON'T deliver. Big bummer."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years and it never disappoints. The staff are lovely, the food is great, and they never cut corners. They are our go to sushi restaurant and my whole family loves it. If you were to ask my kids right now what they want to eat out for dinner they won't say McDonalds or some other fast food place. They will enthusiastically yell \"Sushi!\" And expect that Mazz is where we will head out to."}
{"text":"Great food for fear value.  I come here often with my friend for lunch or is always yummy,  healthy and cheap."}
{"text":"Supermarket maki with low quality fish, too ripe avocado, bring a knur for the lobster and else, nothing to compare with district bistrot was on  same location."}
{"text":"When I first mode into the area, Mazz was the first sushi joint we checked out (Tokyo down the road was closed...as it is right now...).  Unpretentious decor, decent service and decent sushi.  Also, tried the take-away and was pleasantly surprised at how fresh it was.

These guys need a website.  Thanks to the other Yelpers for the menu shots!"}
{"text":"It's just good, clean, average but tasty sushi. It won't wow you but it won't disappoint you either. The service is friendly, the complimentary appetizers of congee and tofu are appreciated and in the 6 years I've been walking a couple blocks to have sushi lunch or their unagi bento (their unagi is delish!), the quality has been consistent. This is a safe, solid choice for a good, simple lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Finally made to Mazz after trying out most other sushi places in the area, and I think this is our new favourite spot. We ordered a roll combo & some other sushi. It was all fresh & tasty, very well priced."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been frequent customers to Mazz Sushi, so I was suprised when we came one day, and the male waiter started acting very rude & inconsiderate towards us. The food is good but the service is TERRIBLE. Although I still crave their food from time to time, I restrain myself because of this disgusting service. We were frequent customers to the business and even then, he acted up towards us. Goes to show how big of a deal customer service is nowadays. Will not be returning & will also be warning others of this terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I was impressed by this place. The fish was fresh, price was reasonable for the amount you get. The sushi wasn't cold and frozen but I think the reason Mazz is so good and get such reviews is because of the extra bit of service they provide. I would definitely go back and try again."}
{"text":"If you live west of the Annex, you hate the idea of going anywhere near the Dufferin Mall for food, and you've had enough Ethiopian food for one day, Mazz Sushi is the place for you!

Mazz is really a great little spot.  The menu is large and full of variety (banana maki - who knew?) and the prices are completely reasonable.  Service is average (in an \"exactly what you'd expect\" way rather than a \"C+ is an 'average' grade\" kinda way).  But what I really like about this place is the generous little starters they give you just for sitting down!  I'm a sucker for being over-compensated.  Last night, my friend and I got a beautifully cooked congee that was mild and savory and warm as well as some cold, delicate tofu in a slightly sweet sesame sauce.  So good!  

Mazz's sushi is pretty average (in a B+ kinda way).  The rice is dense without much flavour (like many of the spots in the Annex) and the fish can be a bit stringy at times, which is a big sushi turn-off for me.  But it was entirely enjoyable and, given the area, a great find.  

Vegetarian Score = 8/10.  All of the basics are there (oshinko, inari, avocado, kappa, yam, etc.) as well as some interesting additions (a caterpillar-type roll made of tempura yam topped with mushroom, for example).  And their bentos look really good, too."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Best Korean neighborhood sushi in Toronto. Fish is always good, service is fast. Price is fine. Free shit. SOLID. This and Asahi on church are the only two places I eat sushi in Toronto and don't have a stomachache after."}
{"text":"Fantastic delicious very affordable lunch special.  I wish this place was in my neighborhood i'd go every day.
Cute little appies (congee, tofu) were served before the great very decently sized tempura bento box, with some Korean side dishes.  The shrimp and veggie tempura was crunchy crisp light and perfect.
The rice was ok, didn't taste like Japanese rice, but i'm not going to moan about that minor (but not insignificant) detraction from an otherwise superb lunch!
The service was really good and polite and charming.
Definitely worth going for lunch, 3-4 times a week!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, I expected more considering the good reviews.

I ordered the golden dragon set. The 6 pieces of spicy salmon rolls that came with it were terrible! There was NO salmon in it! It was filled completely with greasy tempura bits. My friend got the spicy tuna and she experienced the same thing, NO fish in the rolls, just tempura batter bits. What kind of restaurant does that, what a way to cheap out and rip off customers. It was $14.99 too so I'm paying a decent amount of money, I expect to get REAL salmon pieces in spicy salmon rolls!
The sushi rice was dense and mushy as well.

Service is mediocre, they had at least 4 waiters running around the small restaurant but they weren't very efficient. My tea ran dry twice and I had to flag down someone to re-fill it.

I don't know why so many people eat here, the place was full around dinner hours. Honestly, save your money and go down the street to Tokyo Sushi. It's so much better, I usually eat there every couple of weeks. Always good and consistent. I made a mistake to try Mazz sushi for the first time tonight! :("}
{"text":"Haven't been in for awhile... decided to venture in last week... surprise!!!! New menu's, new chairs, new guy behind the sushi counter and no Hi or Bye. 
I don't recognize anyone ... maybe they are new owners?!! Anyhow, I went with cash hoping to take advantage of the 13% discount... they do not offer it any longer. The food was good, service was very good and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"Kind of underwhelming. Decent if you have a sushi craving and you're in that particular area. Certainly wouldn't travel for it though. I wanted to go to Nazareth but they were closed. Nazareth would have been a trillion times better. Mazz wasn't horrid, it was just very meh. It was still a bit before close, I was halfway through my meal and the staff/possibly friends of the staff (because there couldn't have been 12 of them back there) were hanging out in the dining room, seemingly waiting for me to leave. It was kind of awkward. If you're going to do that to someone let them know that they're trying to close up. I would have gotten take out or gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey considering the portion size, but a pretty decent place to go to. Not the greatest sushi, but good service and I've never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"At Mazz Sushi you are guaranteed to get a lot of good sushi for a decent price. I usually order one of the Veggie Bento combos #8 or #9($12) but it is so much food that I can never finish it without help. 

Mazz is Japanese/Korean so there are a lot of menu items that differ from typical sushi joints. 

At Mazz you always get freebies with your meal. Usually a mini salad, mini miso soup (contains fish - not veg), agadashi tofu( they have always told me this is veg, but dashi means fish broth so I suspect it probably isn't), and/or mini congee (contains egg - not vegan) come with the orders. They used to give you bbq fish tails for free too, which really shocked me the first time I was there because I was like 'WTF I did not order this' but I think they stopped because people weren't eating them or maybe it's expensive to give out fish butts for free? I got them wrapped up and took them home for my cats, because what else was I going to do, c'mon.

Green tea with your meal is on the house and if you pay cash you get the tax off (update: think they got busted on that fast one, but it took years). I love having this little place around the corner. If you are in the area this is definitely a prime choice.

Vegan items include: All veggies rolls, but anything with tempura is not fried in purely vegetarian oil (they fry shrimp, etc in there), sweet potato noodles, edamame."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the food here as well as the atmosphere. Came for lunch on a Monday afternoon so it was pretty chilled. I had the lunch special A which was Maki and Sushi and it was nicely presented with a couple of small salad-y sides. It's called a 'Korean Japanese' restaurant which is why the sides were basically kim chi! Yummy. Only 4 stars because the lunch came with the usual miso soup BUT NO green tea :("}
{"text":"Mazz is the victim of their own success.  Like most Korean/Japanese places the menu is large, the portions are large, the prices are small and there are always extras, but...

They haven't scaled to their success.  I went there for the 1st time in several years last night.  Arrived around 6:15 to an empty restaurant and left at about 7:30 to a packed one.  In the ensuing time my table enjoyed a varied and delicious selection of maki, sashimi, udon, and veg bento boxes. Everyone was happy with the food.  It arrived at a reasonable pace, but it was all the \"other things\" that, for me, detracted from the experience.

A table of 5, each drinking tea with water backups.  Most of our glasses were empty, and air-dried before we could find the waitress to get refills.  Refills were slow and not plentiful.  For me the is a huge issue of protocol.  When I eat Japanese, I expect my tea cup to be full and piping hot all the time.  Failing that, I expect there to be water on the table.  

When we went to pay, I had to walk and find the waitress and ask for the bill, and then later when we needed change I had to go in search of her again.

I'm not sure if they were just short-staffed last night, or aren't staffing appropriately for the dinner rush, but either way, the lack of attentiveness took this review from a 4 (or maybe 5) star review to a 3."}
{"text":"We were pretty thrilled with Mazz, though this might have something to do with our most recent sushi foray into mediocrity (we're lookin' at you, JJ on Roncy!).

For $30 +tax/tip we got ourselves a satisfying and tasty sushi boat:  if I recall correctly, 18 maki, 6 nigiri, and 8 sashimi, though don't quote me on that.  The portions were generous, in particular the sashimi -- yes, Mazz is slightly more expensive than some places, in particular Sushi on Bloor, but I was truly impressed with the size of the fish on offer here.  Many cheaper joints offer you relative shavings, maki padded with excessive rice, nigiri stacks that cruise on veritable rice-tanks... all in an effort to fill you on the cheap.

Along with the boat, we enjoyed complimentary tea, miso, congee(!), salad, two tiny pads of marinated tofu, and a rather huge portion of edamame.  The soup and salad are on par with what I'd expect from most places.  The edamame was a surprise and very, very tasty.  The congee, also a surprise, was rather forgettable, but whatever -- it was free, and hardly worth giving a second thought.

Everything was served fast, and our server actually seemed to enjoy himself -- always a plus!  He appeared... amused, as though he were living his own private little quip and each dish presented was part of a greater punch line.  In short, we quite liked him.

Anyway, factoring in the freebies, we were stuffed -- not bad at all for $30+t/t, and the quality was certainly a step above SoB or other cheap sushi joints we've been to.

Finally, I'll note that the place is very quiet -- so hope there are no loud-talkers present when you arrive.  Or bring a group and book the private, curtained booth.  

All in all we'll certainly be back to Mazz, and soon.  Hopefully they keep the good times rollin' and we can enjoy a long, fruitful foodie relationship!"}
{"text":"I ordered my meal for take out from Mazz, so I can't comment on the accessibility of the restaurant or the gendered states of the bathrooms.  Mazz does offer SOME vegetarian options, but many meals contain eggs and/or mayo, so I wouldn't send a vegan here.

I was told to visit this place by a bartender at Civil Liberties aka the Pineapple bar.  He told me it was his FAVORITE sushi place in Toronto.  Now I realize that's a lot of hype to live up to, but I knew I had to give it a try.

I was very hungry after work and decided to bite the bullet.  I was hesitant to order from Mazz because, to be honest, I found their menu a bit expensive.  For instance, a chirachi meal their was $16, versus the $10-13 that most other sushi places in the city charge.  I realize that's not a HUGE difference, but dollars add up.

Anyways, I was too hungry to argue with myself and placed a chirachi order to go.  I was told it would take about 40 minutes, which seemed like a while, but I had no choice.

When I went to pick up my meal, the place was slammed with customers.  There was a huge line of people paying for their meals, waiting for tables or trying to pick up meals.  The servers seemed a little overwhelmed. I was able to pick up and pay for my meal without much hassle.

When I got home, I wasn't super impressed.  My chirachi was good, but wasn't very big for $16+tax.  And since the soup and salad were the typical fair from a Canadian sushi restaurant, I was a little disappointed.  The fish was good and so was the meal, but when I'm paying a premium, I guess I expect things to be great.  And they were just good.  So I won't be returning."}
{"text":"It is a long while since I've been here, hoping it's gotten better. When we were there, there were mice! More than one, running around the floor of the dining area. Customers were squealing and pulling their feet up off the floor. The server just pretended it wasn't happening. We were on a parents' night out and didn't have time to find another place to go before getting home to the sitter, so we just tried to ignore it, too. Don't think I've been back since then."}
{"text":"Very decent neighbourhood sushi place. The food we ordered was a bit above average and the food is pretty consistent there. It's nice that they give you free appetizers like korean congee too. We were stuffed at the end!! I probably wouldn't come out of the way to try this place, but if you're looking for a reliable sushi place in the neighbourhood, check it out!"}
{"text":"This place was not as great as I thought it would be based on the other reviews. 

The decor was nice and the little private room at the back looked cosy/cool, as well as a couple nice booths on the one side. 

But really, considering the location (Bloor/Dufferin) I expected it to be a bit cheaper. Unlike Sushi on Bloor and the Annex strip sushi joints, Mazz does not offer lunch specials on the weekends. And the weekday lunch specials posted were not especially cheap either. Sorry, but for Bloor/Dufferin area I want cheap, dammit!

I paid $12 for 3 rolls (california, spicy salmon, and one called \"banana roll\" which I had to try just because i've never had banana in a roll before). Each roll was 6 very small pieces. They were okay, wouldn't say incredible but decent. 

I didn't get any free salad or miso so I was a bit pouty about the whole experience, spending $12 plus tax and tip is over double what I'd pay for a Sushi on Bloor lunch special.

The cheerful server must have had a day off when I went, cause I got the beeeeyotch! 

Mazz, meh!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and each visit is consistent in both service and freshness/deliciousness of food. The waiter that I usually get here is very polite and the Chef always says hi/bye upon entering/exiting. I've never had to wait too long for food, and always get as much free tea as I like.

Atmosphere is best if you're lucky enough to get a booth or come with a large party and get the private room in the back.

I love the Salmon teriyaki. They serve Salmon Steak instead of filet! The Chef makes the teryaki sauce from scratch and it's delicious.  My boyfriend usually gets the Beef bulgogi which is also very good.  The beef is always juicy and tender.  Both the salmon and beef come on top of a bed of bean sprouts/carrots/onions.  Their maki rolls are also worth ordering.  Again, really fresh tasting. 

Awesome place. You won't be disappointed if you come here."}
{"text":"Easy to walk in and get seated on a Saturday night. We shared Edamame and a beef set that came with salmon and tuna sushi. It was PLENTY of food, and it was pretty fresh and really cheap. I'll probably go back when I want a sushi fix as it's only 5minute walk from my place."}
{"text":"Terrible sushi, horrible salmon teriyaki (they serve frozen prepared salmon teriyaki) and even worse service.

Went here on a referral from a friend one Saturday afternoon.  Ordered the nigiri dinner and my guest ordered the salmon teriyaki dinner.  My guest requested the teriyaki sauce be served on the side as she's diabetic and watches her sugar intake.

We had gyoza to start, so/so.

The nigiri sushi was portioned tiny, the selection was mostly salmon - very little variety otherwise.

The salmon teriyaki was horrendous.  Despite the request to hold the teriyaki sauce on the side, it came smothered in the sauce.  We attempted to get the waiter's attention (a food runner brought the food and was not able to communicate with us).  The waiter had disappeared.

My guest began snacking on bits of the salmon, but could not stomach the sugary sauce.  When the waiter finally reappeared 20 mins later we summoned him to the table and asked him to take back the salmon.  An argument ensued, he claimed my guest never made that request.

Then he said, if she did, why did she nibble on the salmon...

From there it was all downhill, including a yelling chef (at us and at the waiter).  We asked for the bill and left, and continued our lunch at another place."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and the service was awesome. I like the watermelon they give you, the prices were great, and having my own jug of cold water was clutch."}
{"text":"The food quality is usually okay, but customer service isn't great. If you're looking for a takeout, this is a good option. If you're looking for a nice sushi place to dine-in, there are other options in the area that could be better."}
{"text":"Very clean & the service was amazing... The sushi was also excellent! Would recommend this place to anyone in the neighbourhood.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Mazz! 
I have become a regular over the last 3 years and the chef is always very kind. Even received wonderful carved wood chopsticks at Christmas from him 2 years ago, and a clock this past Christmas!

The fish is always very fresh, and always fast. On the very rare occasion we have had to send something back (more because of being incorrect, the server's English can be a bit rough sometimes....never because of food quality), they're always quick to fix. 

It really pays to become a regular and have the chef recognize you at sushi places. 

But check it out. It's cheap and fresh, worth a try."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sushi, and every neighborhood I have lived in, I have scoped out the best sushi place nearby.

Mazz Sushi is a place I discovered a few years ago when I lived by Bloor and Lansdowne, mostly went because it was close by, and since then I have tried sushi spots all over the Bloor Line, from Kipling Station to Bay and I can honestly say, many miso soups, edamame, sashimi, and maki's later, I have realized this is the best place I have been to.

I don't know where to start, the Salmon sashimi is fresh and has never been slimy, the maki's are all excellent. The edamame is served hot and is fresh and they have a great menu with so many options to suit everyone.

In addition to this, all special rolls are served with congee, miso soup and a salad and a fresh orange half after your meal. The tea is free and the waiters are very kind.

I recommend this place for eating solo, or in groups of 2, 3 or 4. Anything more and it gets a bit tight, as the place isn't very large, but it's very cozy and very appropriate for conversations and a great meal.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Solid local Sushi place. My go to place for relatively quick take out or drop in with the kids. It a definite step-up from the chain sushi joints but don't expect out of this world sushi. The place is popular - always busy but I've never had to wait for a seat. Service is solid - generally attentive and fast. Good value for money!"}
{"text":"Had the Korean Style Spicy Seafood Udon, consisted of some shrimps, squid, and one mussel.  The soup was nice and hot, good for the cold weather. This dish came with a salad, which I found a bit too sour (too much vinegar).  There were also complimentary warm Korean congee and two thin slices of cold marinated tofu as appetizers, which were light and appreciated.  
The meal was decent but I felt rushed from beginning to end, even though the place wasn't busy.  The waitress came before we could finish reading the menu to make a decision.  She left right after our food order, before we could order some tea.  We got our tea from another waiter, and it didn't refilled until we asked. Appetizer dishes were cleared out just as I was finishing my last bite.  The bill came with some orange slices, I was still eating my udon and didn't ask for the bill.  I asked for a container so I could take my leftover udon to go, at this point I felt awkward to keep eating. The waiter came with the card machine while I was still in the middle of packing.  The whole experience was a little uneasy for me."}
{"text":"Was in the area for lunch so I decided to check this place out based on other Yelp recommendations. I got here just in time for the lunch special. $11 for 9 pieces of assorted sushi, 6 pieces of maki, a surprising assortment of sides, and a sliced orange for dessert. Definitely above and beyond what I was expecting and the sushi was delicious. Service was also really friendly and attentive. I'd come here again for lunch in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, but the place is small and very busy.

We got a couple of rolls (dynamite, spicy salmon, and catepillar) and a Seafood udon. All the rolls are soooo good and i especially loved the spicy salmon, which was only 4.50. The portions are generous and special rolls are about $10-$12, which is pretty average. The seafood udon was okay and could be improved--just come here for the fish and sushi.

Free appetizers include miso soup, korean congee, and salad. 

For drinks we got plum wine and a beer. 

The total was about $50 after tax and tips, which is a bit on the high side, but only because we actually ordered way more than we can eat and had some really good stuff leftover :( 

Great place!"}
{"text":"There are a shitload of anonymous sushi restos in the Annex and you're going to have to travel west to hit real gold. Ever since discovering this place I haven't been able to eat at other sushi restos without feeling like I'm being unfaithful. This place is the shit and they sill remain stubbornly modest. 

I run the risk of sounding cliched when I say this but I'll do it anyways. The atmosphere at Mazz is great. You walk in and a cheerful server welcomes you. Their servers are always happy and accommodating. You now have a choice between their standard tables and the big wooden party room. If your party is big enough, take the room. You will not be disappointed. 

Everybody seems to be talking about quality, authentic sushi nowadays. I have a feeling that you can't find that stuff anywhere outside the land of the rising sun so I've settled for good ol' north american-style sushi. This place has good (good, not great, good) sushi. The menu is huge, with several pages of rolls, sashimi and sushi combos. Freebie appetizers always come before the meal. The mains are all Korean and Japanese barbecue dishes with a smattering of udon bowls and plates and the standard bento boxes. This place is great because you can stuff your face full of sushi for under $12. 

If all that didn't convince you, here is one more tip. The take 15% off your total if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous solid sushi place. Our friend and fellow yelper actually recommended it to us and weve been since, a handful of times . It is very consistent in quality and taste. The sushi is always very fresh and service quick, friendly and efficient. We found that the prices were very reasonable as well with dinner costing us around the 40-50.00 mark for dinner for two. They have a rpetty yummy banana roll and i love their rice poridge. warms you right up and is a great start to their meal. 

recommend if your in the area and sick of Sushi on Bloor."}
{"text":"So far the best sushi I've found in Toronto, at least around my neighbourhood. Wish they had a better selection of noodle dishes but otherwise the quality of sushi is always really good, and I've enjoyed both dining in or getting take out."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi chefs I've come across in the city, no exaggeration. This place is always busy both in house and with takeout, which means service is slow (even though the servers are going as fast as they can) but it is definitely worth it!!!  Prices great, large portions, and my vegetarian boyfriend loves the food here, too.  Also, they always give complimentary appetizers: miso soup, garden salad, and Korean congee!! This place is one of the best."}
{"text":"We came here 3 times in one week (in town for a conference). The service was top notch. The female server had a genuine kindness that we loved being around. The prices were GREAT, especially for the quality and amount of food served. Just wow. We will stay in this part of Toronto again just so we can be within walking distance of Mazz!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local sushi spot. I love the appetizers: congee, marinated tofu, miso soup and salad. 
My favorites are the veggie bento #9 or the stone bowls. I would recommend this place to everyone. If you are super hungry get a love boat and a doggie bag. The food never stops coming."}
{"text":"I had a Love Boat A with two lovelies last night, and it was fresh and tasty. A huge assortment of sushi, sashimi and maki on an adorable little boat. What more could a girl want? 

On top of our Love Boat we ordered their spicy banana roll, something Mazz is apparently known for. What is wrong with y'all? It's gross! If you like hot banana deep fried in sushi with spicy mayo maybe this is for you? But it sure as sugar ain't for me. 

I'd like to return and sit in their special Island room at the back with the curtains drawn and have an ultimate sushi feast with friends."}
{"text":"I am always sniffing for delicious sushi. There are many variables in finding the ultimate joint. 
1) Freshness and quality of fish
2) Quality of salad and miso
3) Quality Service
4) Fair price
 
etc etc

This place meets all my standards. It's a close second to my favourite place, which is Sushi on Bloor. It is also my neighbourhood favorite, being 3 blocks away from home.

I've only gotten take out here a couple of times. Each time, it's been delicious. The salad dressing and the miso have been bland but tastier than most. The quality of sushi is well above average. The rolls are neatly packed and not too rice-heavy, thus focusing on the actual fillings. I'm a fan of the spicy rolls, the ones from Mazz leave a lingering tingle. 

My pick and standard is the Spicy Roll Set(cali, tuna and salmon), it's 18 pieces and $13, which is fair and comparable to other sushi places throughout downtown.

If you're heading west by Dovercourt on Bloor. Hit up Mazz. You won't be disappointed. The other dishes at this joint look and smell delectable as well. 

Also, the staff are pleasant and efficient. 

Amazzzzing!"}
