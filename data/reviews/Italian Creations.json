{"text":"I'll jump on this five-star wagon. Taste is outstanding and portions are enormous.   Had the linguini carbonara. Very rich and very tasty. We also had the pesto fettuccine with chicken and artichokes. Pesto sauce was excellent.   Baked ziti was mixed with so much cheese, the red sauce looked pink. And mama had an eggplant parmigiana sandwich that she really liked.   Nobody ate more than 1/3 of their pasta.   Also got the pepperoni bites which were excellent. Lastly, I ordered a stuffed pizza with pepperoni and black olives. As a big fan of Chicago style stuffed pizza, this one missed the mark. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but not what I expected. Antonio's does it right, in a spring form pan where the sides stand 3-4\" tall, a huge bread roll on top and red sauce in the center sprinkled with parmigiana. This stuffed pizza was more like a round calzone. Matter in fact, one of my daughters asked who got the calzone?  There was no sauce on it, but a big tub on the side.   Bottom line, very, very good. If you don't want leftovers, order half of what you think you need."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Ordered a make your own pasta dish for dinner based on the recommendation of my mother. Awesome! Pesto was out of this world, noodles was perfectly cooked, the shrimp and mushrooms were to die for. Just a perfect meal all around, and the best part? I enjoyed it in the comfort of my own home!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery to my home for my husband & me. It was fantastic. Its just as good as Brunos & Peppers."}
{"text":"If it's on their menu, it has got to be good. I have NEVER been disappointed by the Creations coming from this loving Italian business. There usually isn't seating available as their catering business is hopping, so plan to carry your goods home in some sort of camouflage bag to reduce your risk of being hamburgled! Seriously tho, the family that owns this wonderful place is a breath of fresh air. I recommend the pasta with Vodka Cream sauce.   You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, have been looking for a great Italian place. Portions were HUGE and they don't skimp on the sauce which is a great thing because it is awesome. Comes with a salad or soup, Italian dressing was good and so was the bread. Doesn't look like much on the outside, but who cares with food like this! Great take out, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to have Italian Creations Cater our wedding this month and were incredibly happy with our choice to do so!    So going back several months, we called around several different catering companies to see what our options were.  We had good vibes from talking with the owner of Italian Creations, Ross, who was easy-going on the phone and friendly.  Ross worked with us to tailor a bit of what we wanted, and we went in for a tasting.  We tried a few different things, and decided  on the following: chicken, salmon, lemon-butter topping for the meats, green beans, quinoa-rice, penne pasta, and bread.    I should note that while I can't recall having bad wedding food before, I've never really had wedding food that stands out to me.  It's always just kind of been there.  But trying Ross's 'Italian Creations', we knew immediately this food would be different and that this was the food we wanted at our wedding.  We didn't 'settle' on anything, we knew we found a gem.    So fast forward to the day of the wedding... The server (I feel bad but forgot her name!) showed up when Ross said she would, and worked quietly and efficiently to set things up in the food room.  We had a very small venue, so were worried we might hear food-set up while the ceremony was taking place.  None of that, she was super quiet!  Another thing we really appreciated, our server helped with many other areas that weren't even her responsibility and which we were planning on doing ourselves; operating our popcorn machine, arranging and 'guarding' the dessert table, cleaning up dishes, etc.  This took a lot of stress off of us and was incredibly helpful.  Also our server was very personable and friendly, working with and talking with several of our guests and helpers throughout the day.    Now to the food itself.  One worry that we were warned about from others was that the food during a tasting is always good, but that the food at the wedding itself might not live up to the standard of the tasting.  With the food Italian Creations served this was as far from the truth as possible.  My lord, this was honestly some of the best Italian food I've ever had.  While I won't write a review on every food item that we received, I will say this; Several people stated separately that the chicken, the salmon and the pasta were the best they have ever had before.  Not just at a wedding, but in their lives.  For myself, this was the best salmon and pasta I've ever had, and plan to order these from Italian Creations in the future.  Many people asked for the name of the place we got our food :)  And finally clean up was quick, efficient and didn't get in the way of any of the party.  We had a caricature artist positioned just a few feet away from the food table, and our server worked very well to make sure nothing was in the way and did not disrupt any of the art.    My hats off to Ross, his chefs, and our wonderful server.  Our wonderful day was made all the more wonderful by them, and we sincerely appreciate the wonderful service."}
{"text":"I had my wedding on September 30th at Ariel International Center and Italian Creations catered my special day. With that said, it couldn't have been more special than it was without Ross and his team! The food was outstanding! Seriously, I can't say enough about these guys, they were a huge part in making my day perfect!"}
{"text":"Updated review: We have ventured into more than Baked Ziti, and folks, it's so good. We got the Chicken Marsala (which is one breast, all the mushrooms ever, gnocchi and Marsala gravy), a personal pizza (to taste it) and two salads.  It was plenty for my very pregnant self, my husband and our 3 year old. The salads are huge! 6 x 6 container filled and their ranch dressing is wonderful!  The Chicken Marsala was amazing! I mean, like we want to throw a party just so they cater it, it's that good.  The pizza was superb! It's what I remember from growing up. We are DEFINITELY getting a full size one next time. And, as if all that wasn't good enough, they were short on fresh bread so we got a free dessert instead. Hello? I'm in love!   All of that for $21. If you haven't tried this place yet, do it. I'm so happy it's at the end of my street :)"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place to order food from! The specialty Alfredo is the best I've ever had! Also there ranch salad dressing is bomb.com!"}
{"text":"The crew brought us catering for a show at the Agora. Holy hell! Everything was incredibly good. Not being a vegan, I was skeptical of a couple dishes. But was I wrong. Thank you for taking such good care of us!"}
{"text":"Having used Italian Creations for several high school team dinners I knew they made great food.  I knew they didn't have a sit down restaurant but was excited to learn they had a carry out menu and vowed to try them out from time to time.  Alas I do tend to forget about this option but last night being tired and groggy from a red eye flight and craving sone good Italian food thought of Italian Creations and gave them a call. Ok so here is the scoop. They have limited carry out hours/days. Call ahead before you get yourself set to order. The carry out menu is usually only found on the desktop version of their website but now that you know the secret to ordering from their yummy menu.. order away. Our dinners were reasonably priced under $15 and included soup or salad and soft delicious bread.  My husband ordered soup (tomato bisque) and chicken Marsala. I ordered soup and salad(to share) and the carbonara dinner. I loved the soup. It was amazing, in fact I'll go on record saying it was the best tomato bisque soup I have ever had. The salad that we shared was topped with carrots and a bit of mozzarella. My Carbonara was extra creamy and rich. Great flavor!  My husband liked the Marsala although commented he'd wished his chicken breast had been larger, but the gnocchi it was served with kept him full and happy. Altogether a great carry out dinner. And the fact that they wrap all the containers in foil keep all our food hot until we were ready to eat, always a plus for take out.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Only the best comes from Italian Creations! The quality of every single item on both the carry out/delivery & catering menus are top notch. And always accompanied by the nicest customer service!  Large portions for great prices of delicious Italian food for carry out & delivery, all homemade. Recently voted the people's best choice of pizza in Lakewood!  Excellent service, organization & top food quality even for every party from small to large highlights the catering side of the business."}
{"text":"Italian Creations is perfect for everything from a night in, to an elegant wedding. Their food is fantastic, and the portions are big, so there are always leftovers for lunch! You must try the roasted red pepper sauce, which you can order on pasta or pizza. All of their sauces and dressings are homemade, which makes it even better. I have used Italian Creations for several catering events, and it has always turned out flawlessly."}
{"text":"***Update: we had the pizza tonight and it was so delicious. I think it's the best pizza in have had in CLE since moving here last year. We also tried the carbonara- seemed more like an Alfredo sauce. But honestly, it was so good, they can call it whatever they like! I have yet to try something we don't like. My hubby says they will cater everything in our life from here forward.***   The best thing that ever happened to me when craving Italian food in Lakewood was ordering from Italian Creations.   I've currently tried the chicken parmesan, the meat lasagna and the chicken marsala.  First, the red sauce for the lasagna and the chicken parm is so yummy- nice rich flavor and perfect balance of sweet and rich. The perfect sauce. My hubby and I ordered these two dishes the first time and we had enough for two huge meals. Warning: you will want to eat it all. All of it. Great portion of chicken and pasta. Lasagna was beyond delicious. I tend not to order lasagna but this is one I just can't stop thinking about. Layers of cheese and meat and tons of sauce. Both dishes reheated very well.   Next try was a solo run and I had the chicken marsala. Um, outrageously good! This is not something I would order but hubby put the idea in my mind and wasn't feeling red sauce. He does not like gnocchi so I ordered with spaghetti instead so he could eat the leftovers. Hahaha- testament to true love that there was anything left. Sauce was creamy and perfect hint of sweetness but rich from the wine. Huge slices of portobello mushrooms. Yum!   The prices may seem high  but don't let that deter you!  We are talking super generous portions and homemade goodness. From other places in the area, portion/price ratio is a real steal. This is fine dining Italian in the comfort of your own home.   The meals we had all came with salad and bread. The bread should have a review of its own because it is THAT good. Soft and flavorful, with focaccia like crusty layer on top. I just want to eat the whole loaf.   Definitely try this place out!! I can't wait to try the pizza and sandwiches. Ok, and I have an eye on the carbonara..  They deliver for a $2 service fee."}
{"text":"Awesome food, very professional and Ross is a great person to have on your side for entertaining your guests."}
{"text":"We have been eating Italian Creations for years. This is a great local Lakewood business run by one of the nicest families in the city. Most recently indulged in their cuisine at an after wake get together to mourn the loss of a friend's father. Rest in peace. The food was excellent enough to momentarily take people's minds off the sadness and loss. I would highly recommend their catering service for any occasion. They offer carryout options as well which is great for some quality Italian food on the go for a great price point."}
{"text":"The best pizza! Wonderful ingredients available like goat cheese, artichoke hearts, barbecue chicken. Delicious crust too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant, if you haven't had their take out I highly suggest you step your game up. Great catering service for any occasion; not to mention the amazing staff of very helpful beautiful people I just wish they could bottle the smell of the restaurant."}
