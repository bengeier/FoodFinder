{"text":"Came across this place quite by hazard as we were heading back to our hotel. Its \"fish bowl\" arrangement gave us an opportunity to see that the place was still quite full despite being well into the tail end of lunch on a work day, and most everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  They can't all be wrong I said to myself, and in we went.  Service was helpful and brisk without being hurried, and we were served by the manager herself.  She offered assistance picking between equally intriguing dishes when asked, and her advice was spot on.  I had the 3 small plate or \"petiscos\" special (stuffed grilled sardine escabeche, caldeirada, and green salad) which my wife also had (charcuterie plate, pork tenderloin and clams, and frites with lime aioli). As was very good, as was the wine.  Having been to Lisboa years ago, as well as worked in east Cambridge, MA I was familiar with Portuguese food.  This did not disappoint, being both familiar and yet new in a refreshingly playful way.  Don't be surprised if you come in expecting a quick bite on the way to Wilfrid-Pelletier Hall... And you end up not being able to leave!  Between the good food, amicable service, and the cozy setting, you'll find the spot quite alluring."}
{"text":"Accueil plutôt froid du fait que nous n'avions pas de réservation. À vrai dire, j'aurais pu demander un verre de bouette et d'escargot broyés saupoudrés  d'herbe à puces que j'aurais reçu la même réaction sur le visage du type à l'entrée.  Nous nous sommes fait assigner une place au bar, ce qui nous donnait une vue directe du service.  La demoiselle au bar semblait très expérimentée et très agréable dans son service.  Et là, ça se gâte ....   Un des serveurs, le même qui nous avais accueilli, ne cessait de se passer la main dans les cheveux, d'éternuer sans toujours mettre sa main et nous l'avons même surpris à se moucher avec du papier brun, ensuite de s'essuyer \"l'excédent\" avec ses mains nues et de prendre des napperons et la coutellerie pour aller mettre table.... sans se laver les mains ....  La nourriture est très bonne, la sélection des vins est également très agréable mais la qualité de certains serveurs laisse grandement à désirer ...  Pensez-y bien si vous n'êtes pas vacciné"}
{"text":"Great food and very good and attentive service. I would return for sure."}
{"text":"I live nearby so thought i'd pop in and see what it's like...  The place looks trendy, with a nice terasse and all...  ok, to the food.  For entree we ordered fried calamari, main dishes we ordered Bitoque (portugese steak with fries), Bison short ribs, and a pasta dish which i don't remember the name but it was a tube pasta with green peas.   The calamari was great, soft batter fresh calamari, the short ribs were very tender, it came with sweet potato mash very nice...  The steak was good, it had nice texture and was tender, the fries were real nice too. But the pasta was awful, it tasted like provigo pasta that you could reboil from home, it was tough and under cooked, i'm not talking al dente, it was rubbery and dry, felt like plastic...  nice place but the pasta just ruined it... there arre some interesting choices i want to try out though, since i'm so close :)  I'll give it a second chance, but the price is a bit steep for the quality... it's ok and it charges like it's really good lol"}
{"text":"La nourriture, servie sous forme de tapas, est excellente et pardonne un peu pour l'ambiance extrêmement bruyant."}
{"text":"Superb location; pleasant ambience; excellent cuisine; and great service."}
{"text":"Delicious fish, tasty chocolate verrine, very attentive service and a wonderfully calm evening on the terrace with just the sounds of the water fountains and the voice of our friends. Thanks F Bar"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est décontractée mais sans être trop guindée. Le menu est intéressant proposant plusieurs plats typiques portuguais sous formes de tapas."}
{"text":"Taverne f is located right next to place des art, so it's in a great location to dine, enjoy the nice summer weather, and people watch  There's an option of indoor and outdoor seating - the interior of the restaurant is decorated beautifully, but the weather was super nice so my friend and I opted to sit outside.  We ordered the calamari, cod cakes, and beef tartare to share, and they were all extremely tasty.  Our server was very friendly as well.    In short, great location, delicious food, and good service! Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"The location is just fantastic, the fishbowl that looks over Jeanne Mance. The food and service are equally well done. Opened by Chef Ferreira, Chef Gilles Herzog cooks up two delightful menus, one called F and the other called Bar, which is one of the few confusing things about the menu. The bar part of the menu seems to be more bar and brasserie food and the F side seems to be more formally Portuguese inspired.  We started with the tartare and the octopus, two excellent choices. The mains were sweetbreads and short ribs. The dessert was fine but not spectacular. The guanaja and the pear. The The pear was a bit small, but the crispy \"arlette\" was wonderful."}
{"text":"Nous nous sommes rendus à la Taverne F, ma copine et moi, pour un souper en amoureux et nous n'avons pas été déçus. Les restos de tapas sont de plus en plus nombreux à Montréal, mais la Taverne F innove avec ses tapas portugais. Le menu varié (veau, agneau, poulet, pieuvre grillée, poisson) est parfait pour combler tous les types d'appétit.  Nous avons chacun opté pour la table d'hôte spéciale après 20h qui donne accès à 3 petiscos (plats à partager) pour 21$ et nous avons été comblés. Le contre-filet de veau, son oeuf miroir et sa sauce était délectable. Nous recommandons également le gravlax de thon qui contrairement aux habitudes était coupé en cube offrant ainsi une texture différente.  Enfin, il est impossible de ne pas apprécier l'ambiance de ce restaurant avec ses murs vitrés qui donnent une vue magnifique sur la Place des festivals. De plus, notre serveur a été des plus sympathiques et nous a offert un service parfait.  Nous recommandons donc la Taverne F pour une soirée romantique à deux ou pour une soirée entre amis."}
{"text":"Mediocre and overpriced-considering-the-quality downtown Montreal restaurants, you've been schooled. No longer do we have to avoid you by walking down to the Old Port or by taking a cab up to the Plateau (because honestly, no one wants to walk up a hill in this humid weather). We can just head to F Bar.  From the beginning, much was expected from Ferreira Café's little sister restaurant. After all, Ferreira's known for its delicious Portuguese seafood - it's usually quite flawless. A more casual restaurant could have gone either way - really good or really bad. Well, it's been open for a while and I can honestly say that F Bar doesn't disappoint. Want air conditioning? Cool. Want to sit outside on the long terrasse? Done. At F Bar, you can choose your own adventure. Not only that, but the service is friendly and the food is delicious. Do we have a downtown favorite? We just might...  My friend and I have similar penchants when it comes to food, so we actually ordered exactly the same dishes. First, the octopus appetizer. It was great. Slightly charred and super fresh, it was place atop of a chickpea, mint and pepper purée. Not a new concept, but one that was executed well.  Next, we both ordered the scallop main. It was hands down the best scallop dish I've had in Montreal. Not only that, but it was big! The scallops were fresh and plump, grilled to perfection. Not undercooked, not overcooked, but actually perfect - considering scallops come in different sizes, it's not an obvious feat. They were accompanied by cauliflower and a fluffy cauliflower-potato mash, in an amazing mystery sauce. Each ingredient added to the deliciousness of the dish, all while complementing each other. I would have this main a hundred times over.  Finally, we ordered the coconut milk rice pudding and the natas for dessert. The rice pudding was light and fluffy, adorned with pineapple and passionfruit-basil sorbet. Sweet and sour. Yum. As for the natas - these mini Portuguese custard tarts are sold all over Montreal. Although it's not something we're missing, a nata that's not too eggy, not too doughy and not too sweet is hard to find. You get where I'm going - F Bar did a stellar job with this dessert too. Their natas had a flaky crust, a fluffy light custard and cinnamon on top. And they were warm. HELLO.  Needless to say, this place is good. Really good. Go.

{"text":"Way overpriced. You need a magnifying glass to see the portions. Pretentious and tasteless."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. The food was fresh and tasty and service was good - food came at a reasonable speed.  We ordered many different dishes. They come in pretty small plates and the restaurant recommends that each person take 3-4 dishes, but if you share with others you probably don't need that many. I recommend the grilled octopus and lamb feijhoada.  Wines can be hard to choose because they are all Portuguese so we were unfamiliar with them, however the waiter made a good recommendation.  The restaurant itself is narrow, a bit noisy and intimate. It is very modern and new."}
{"text":"really good - Portuguese style steak is worth having - not something I would normally order, but am glad I did. Must have the rice pudding - it is very good. the wait staff was super nice."}
{"text":"Les tapas cest toujours une bonne option pour partager un repas en couple ou avec des amis !   La taverne F est vraiment l'un des meileure endroit pour manger cest petit plat d'inspiration portugaise ! De plus, le resto est en plein centre de la place des festival ! C'est donc l'endroit parfait pour manger avant un show ou avant de sortire en ville !   Le service etait parfait et la bouffe aussi !   Bref j'aime beaucoup cette endroit :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and sumptuous food!  We had a nice drink followed by braised lamb for me and a hamburger for the hubs.  Didn't have room for dessert but that didn't keep us from taking the chocolate mousse home for dessert.  Can't go wrong with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great location. Excellent menu. Wine list is Portuguese like the chef. Menu is varied enough for all to find something they like. Lamb Shank was very well cooked. Servers were very helpful esp with the wine as I know little of the wines of Douro."}
{"text":"Went for the first time during the Poutine Week to try their delicious salted cod poutine, which at first did not really seem like a good idea but ended up being a delectable pouts! The grilled chicken was juicy, perfectly cooked and tasty. I liked that for $21, you can pick three different items to share; perfect for a quick lunch with a friend during the week. The service was great and very professional with the wine and many private importations to choose from regarding Portuguese wines - loved it. I'll be back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Cadre sympa, en plein sur la Place des arts dans un aquarium Si on veut être en intimité, c'est loupé car tout le monde peut vous voir de dehors Carte très fournie en toutes sortes de tapas, tous aussi bons les uns que les autres (chefs de chez Ferreira, resto très réputé, d'où le F..) Le bon plan, c'est d'y aller à plusieurs et les partager, pour tout goûter ;) On vous conseille aussi sur le vin et les cocktails Il y a une caméra dans la salle qui donne sur la cuisine, et vice versa; ainsi, on peut voir les cuisiner préparer nos plats, et même se faire coucou :D A essayer!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality price ratio, I love the concept of the menu. Very good food, typical of a Portuguese tavern. A go to place in the quartier des spectacles."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to grab a bite with friends if the purpose of the evening is to catch up and enjoy each other company for a small bill. Staff is friendly and they have a special for lunch and dinner: 3 dishes for $21.  The food was alright. My group ordered most of the items on the menu unfortunately none really stood out except maybe the sardine."}
{"text":"Food tastes really good, but portions are ridiculously small. Service is fast and courteous. The menu could be better explained and more options of sides could be added. The experience was somewhat deceiving.  The good surprise was the quite nice Super bock beer."}
{"text":"Affiliated as it is with Cafe Fererra, an excellent Porteguese fish restuarant in Montreal, I was expecting much better than what I received.   First, the place as empty for lunch. And this on a Friday. That should've been my first clue, because nearby Brasserie T was full to bursting.  Service was haphazard; no less than four individuals served us. Bread on the table was an after-thought. No water to drink unless you asked for it. My friend's calamari was fried hard as a rubber stopper - both times!  I had the fish and chips. The fish was great - not too much batter and cooked just right. But the chips (and they were chips, not fries) were OK, but too salty and some were soggy in the bowl.   Either up your game, or let someone else into the spot."}
{"text":"Oh my dear ! You will get one star, just because I am keeping an open mind today! Where to start. I'm chocked at myself for having to write this esp considering the parent restaurant is among the strongest restaurants in Montreal at which I have always been ext satisfied. Ordered basic stuff: fried calamari and angus AAA filets with quail egg. Calamari were fried as hard as a brick top. I send it back and asked if I would have the same or something else, to which I said same.  Guess what? It comes back a 2nd time just as hard. I send it back. I was in a relaxed mood so was not in a state of mind to complain or say much at all - usually not like me. I was however expecting the waitress to perhaps ask the customer, 'is there anything wrong sir, can we do anything to appease you? Sweet nothing; in fact she could not be bothered.  Wait time between dishes was absurdly long, esp considering lunch menu. Moreover, there was no one in the restaurant. Beef was average at best. I was not charged for the calamari, well, this was expected.  Sorry, avoid this place !!!"}
{"text":"It's a cute place I did not know this was Portuguese food when I went. I was a pleasant surprise. Original, tasty and with a great wine list. We managed to eat fast enough before our show. It's a convenient place"}
{"text":"A wonderful place. The design of the space on a narrow sidewalk is just phenomenal. I wish people can implement this wonderful concept around the world. Great location, in the middle of the Quartier des spectacles, which I can only imagine how lovely of a view it would be on a busy festival night. Service was prompt, fast and friendly.  Food was impeccable with very original combination of flavours and texture. Some of our dishes were presented in a lovely small casserole, simply fantastic. I have recommend this place to many people and will continue to do so. Can't wait to go back next time I'll be in town."}
{"text":"The only reason its not a 5 star review is because the service was inconsistent and its very loud in here.  Otherwise this place is near perfection.  We did love the music, the video of different places on the back wall, and didn't mind the very close seating.  Its very NYC in here. Two of my travel friends and I settled in with a bottle of red and shared the beet salad that had smoked mackerel.  It was divine!  Everything was very good.  I tried the pasta which I know is boring but I was feeling that way.  It was actually very bright with some lemon zest and croutons for crunch on it.  My friends had the chicken and octopus.  All very good.  We loved the vibe, just wish you could hear people.  I think the all glass walls are not good for sound.  But you can see the park (or what's left of it according to my friend) and just hang out drinking wine and watching the beautiful people.  I would add it to my list if I go back to Montreal."}
{"text":"C'est une très belle place pour aller prendre un verre et une petite bouchée! Le restaurant offre un menu de tapas variés (surtout des plats portugais) et de bonne qualité!   Nous étions deux et avons partagés trois \"entrées\" et trois \"repas principaux\" et c'était très suffisant! Je suggère de prendre les sardines, elles sont délicieuses!   Pour les drinks, ils ont beaucoup de choix exclusifs!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this based on the service and not the food... since i didn't stick around to taste anything. My partner and I wandered into this restaurant and were seated almost immediately. The restaurant was 1/4 full and that may be an exaggeration. I noticed right away that the wait staff looked disorganized. Eye contact with several of them was made in hopes to get a greeting and drink order in. Ten minutes later, new guests walked in and were greeted/served, while I sat around waving my hand to get attention. Nope didn't get any. Walked right out of there."}
{"text":"Fresh food, tasty, and amazing service are the 3 characteristics that come to my mind when thinking about this place. However price is a big downside. Went there on a Tuesday night, did not have to wait for a table and service was quick and the staff was very friendly. The menu options are pretty limited but definitely focused on providing the most typical Portuguese experience.  One major downside: the food portions are extremely small for the price you pay. The value for money clearly isn't fair considering they are dishes tapas style. In a regular restaurant you'd get real size dishes for the price you pay for tapas there.  2 mini starters, 2 entrees (tapas style) shared + 1 desert with one glass of wine gave us a $90 bill and we left without feeling full. The desert was a caramel fondant with pear ice cream, probably the only thing we ate that was so incredible we would have paid twice the price for. Otherwise it was too pricy. I will definitely go back once they revise their price!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good place around Place des arts, you should give this place a chance.  The food is amazing, and I really mean it. It sort of made up for the slow service, every dish was   just a perfect creation.   It's a great place to bring your date or your parents, friend or colleagues. If you can get a table outside, you can enjoy watching people pass while sipping your beer. It's also a good spot to book if there are any shows or festivals, you can watch it during your dinner."}
{"text":"I want to give this restaurant a 3.5. It's perhaps one of the coolest, tiny packaged little building I've been in for a restaurant. BEAUTIFUL! That alone was impressive to me.  The servers were so nice and accommodating ~ although our server was not fluent in English, she tried her best and it was appreciated.    I'll be honest to say I didn't know what to expect when I ate here. It's UNIQUE. One of the most unique fusion tasting foods I've had. We tried a various of different dishes. Although not everything was to my taste, I don't remember hating any of the dishes so much that I wouldn't take another bite.  Yes I would try this restaurant again :D Perhaps I should brush up on my french before going back...."}
{"text":"Resto is right next to La Place des arts so great location if you're going to see a show. They make sure to serve you on time & ask as soon as you walk in if you're going to a show. Food is ok. I have a feeling Portuguese food can be much better. Pretty expensive with small portions, tapas style. Resto is very narrow & long to fit on the sidewalk. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Montreal is a happy hour haven. The 5 à 7 is a true institution of our fair city which really ramps up once the weather warms up and the terrasses get going. One of the few downsides of my actual job is that it doesn't really allow me to enjoy downtown happy hours because I work in the West Island and my hours often go past happy hours. A few weeks ago, taking advantage of my family all being downtown for a change on a weeknight and me not being at work late, we met up in Quartier des Spectacles and decided to try Taverne F, the little brother to Cafe Ferrera.  Taverne F is a Portuguese brasserie so its focus is on smaller plates to share as a group while you enjoy some wine or a cocktail. The shipping container-shaped space, located just beside Place des Arts, has a very modern and clean decor although the general narrowness of the space isn't ideal. It causes problems at the entrance of the restaurant when you have patrons waiting for a table and the lack of a atrium causes those people to spill into the bar space right in front and then you can barely move out of your bar stool... which was a problem since we were sitting at the bar. When the beautiful terrasse is available, I suspect it really helps to open up the room and ease this issue.  First dish I tried was Mama Rosa's pork confit. Deliciously fatty pork that just fell apart with a fork. Mama Rosa's spice mixture (whatever it was...) didn't really come out all that much but it succeeded in getting such a great texture through the curing that it didn't matter to me. A nice dish to share.... if you can pull yourself away from the dish in the first place which I wasn't able to do in this instance.  The second dish was the taverne poutine - a Portuguese play on a poutine with salted cod and wild oregano on top of the usual cheese curds and fries. Reading the description of the dish got me very intrigued. I love poutine and salted cod separately and the notice of combining them had never struck me before. In this case, the combination worked very well. The inherent saltiness of the cod plays very well with fries and its flakiness allowed the fish to blend well with the gooey cheese and sauce. The fries were nice and crispy as well (well... at least before the sauce got to them). This was a all-around solid dish and a nice twist on the poutine.  Finally, I could not leave without getting a dessert especially when Taverne F has pastel de Natas on the menu - those delicious little custard egg tarts that I love so much. Flaky and rich with a nice hint of vanilla, Natas are desserts that I could eat everyday and Taverne F's version was no exception. In this case, the pastel de Natas were served with Maria biscuit ice cream, not that we knew that when we ordered them. The ice cream was nice and smooth but the 3 of us could not for the life of us place the subtle sweet flavour of the ice cream in context until our waiter told us - which makes sense because none of us had ever had those cookies before. A solid end to a late happy hour.  Taverne F, due to its location and format, really works well for a quick bite and drink before or after a concert or show. All of the different festivals that occur around it makes this place a happening all throughout the summer... as I have noticed when I have gone by the past few years. The food is solid and the drink options are plentiful. It is a Cafe Ferrera joint so it is not a cheap stop but a worthwhile one if you are in the surroundings, and with festival season around the corner, most of you most certainly will be close by.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"L'autre aquarium de la place des festivals. Pratique pour avant le spectacle. Bon sous tous les angles mais beaucoup trop cher pour ce qu'on a dans l'assiette. La carte des vins semble intéressante mais difficile de se faire une idée de la justesse des prix puisque presque tous en IP."}
{"text":"Really good food.  The calamari was great as well as the Halibut.  The Halibut was made in a causselette and was great."}
