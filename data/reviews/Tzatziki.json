{"text":"I have never written a yelp review. Ever. This establishment forced me to. I honestly don't have high expectations about ordering food at 11:30, but when it comes two hours later, and after a shakedown by the delivery guy by phone after calling justeat to get a refund, I feel like the only Greek I got had nothing to do with food."}
{"text":"Brand new eatery at Pape Ave & Aldrych. Amazing fresh food. Probably the best gyros I have ever experienced. It's namesake, tzaziki, is amazing. I highly recommend this place. Once they overcome some simple learning curves this will be a huge addition to the neighbourhood. Great food, friendly employees, very happy to see it open and so well received."}
{"text":"Amazing gyros, just like they make them in Greece. The gyro meat is good and the fries complete it. Friendly staff and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"When Tzatziki first opened service was amazing and the portions were huge. After a few months, the portion sizes shrunk dramatically and the service declined.  I went in for takeout and it wasn't busy in the restaurant. I stood in front of the cash for 10 minutes and I was never greeted by any staff. The older woman that works there looked at me and then ignored me. I stood there for 10 minutes and then waited around another 5 minutes before I gave up and left.  The food is average but nothing special. I've seen many people with frustrated faces as I've walked by many times. Expect bad service if you're going to eat here."}
{"text":"Usually my husband and I like to post only positive reviews but the experiences that we have had at Tzatziki have been the worst that we have ever encountered in all of years of frequently dining out.  It is a little neighbourhood place to stop and grab a bite. I am sure the food is fine, it is the service that is deplorable. We have given this spot three tries, because it is new and we are forgiving.  Tonight there were 5 servers on, they all stood at the counter and stared at us, muttered to each other. Not one of them smiled, said hi or told us they would right over. We sat for about 10 minutes with 5 servers buzzing around us acting as if we were invisible. Two men came in down behind us and their order was taken immediately. HUH?!?!   That was the last straw for us. You blew it Tzatziki!"}
{"text":"The most horrible Greek food I have ever received. I can't say \"ate\" as it was to discussing to even eat. I ordered \"Chicken Solvakia\" and received \"Chicken Gyro\".....can't explain how extremely disappointed I am. Love small local businesses, but this one ewwwwww and I mean nasty. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times due to the convenient location. Each time with regrets and I won't make the mistake again.   The food is decent if it served warm.   Most recent experience: ordered two chicken gyros and three sides (rice x 2 and fries).  We had to wait over 35 minutes to get our food (no apologies for delay). We get the gyros (and had to ask for our sides after only being handed gyros), we are then handed bag that had obviously been sitting as the grease had soaked all around the brown bag.   We were too hungry to complain and took the cold fries.  My first bite into my chicken gyro I was left with a delicious piercing pain in my mouth as a bone cut the roof of my mouth.  The blood added a nice iron flavour to my gyro, maybe this was the intention.  My past experiences were similar. This place needs to understand better service and rethink their take-out strategy. It doesn't take 35 minutes to put pre-cooked meat into a pita and drop pre-fried fries (perfectly acceptable for crispy fries) for 2 minutes and scoop precooked rice into a container. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"If you have 45minutes to wait around for Greek fast food (souvlaki is the burger equivalent of Greece), this is the place to come! We went there on a Sunday around 6pm (4 adults; 2 kids and a 15 month old); it was not that busy but there were a few other tables occupied. We ordered a gyro each; nothing fancy.  The service is at the pace of molasses! We asked the server to bring us the kids' food first - pita wrapped around some meat, no toppings, nothing - and she seriously paid no attention.  The kids were starving and my husband had to go in to ask them where our food was.  The cooks behind the counter were rude and full of attitude.  My husband was holding the baby and all he got was, \"Hey we're doing our best over here\" as if they had a full restaurant and they were grilling up Angus steaks! So they handed him a plate of fries and send him back outside.  The food arrived 5-10 min after that.  The server also mixed up the gyro orders even after confirming with her which was which, and so people ate the wrong ones.  This was my first time here and I will definitely won't be returning.  The gyro was great but not the best I've had.  Especially on the Danforth, you can find the tasty gyro to go along with the terrific service.  The waiting time plus the attitude we got definitely ruined our experience at this establishment."}
{"text":"This noce and cozy restaurant with clean kitchen today dropped from a 5 to a 1 star. I would  go weekly with my dad because the food was a good serving size and they had the best lemon potatoes in town.  Not to mention we used to go to messini but the service there has gone downhill so this little spot was perfect for us.  A few weeks ago though i ended up with these roasted potatoes. Terrible. Not even cut. I fgured they ran out. Today i went to order a bunch of gyros and was just told they dont have the lemon potatoes. They had the small potatoes. Lazy mans version and i didnt even want to try them again because they were horrible two weeks ago. Quality went down.  Did I mention their proces also went up by $2 each for gyros but the website still reflects old prices. Not going there again. They het your business and now how cares. Wont go."}
{"text":"I've been twice since they opened, and will keep coming back. The gryos (both the chicken & pork) are fantastic. The small dinner plate is massive, could barely finish it. Got the large last time and it was more than enough for two full dinners. Greek fries with feta & oregano were awesome, even half an hour after they were cooked (I was late picking up my take-out order). Can't recommend this spot enough."}
{"text":"we tried to order some of the starters (the spreads/dips which they were advertising as house made and was the only reason why we decided to go) and were told they were out of ALL OF THEM them as the delivery truck didn't make it that day. I said oh, i thought they were house made and the poor girl turned bright red and looked very befuddled and stammered something like, oh they are made somewhere else and brought over....anyway, not promising start and we felt bad for her, we wanted to leave right then but didn't want her to feel bad (why do I think like that??). anyway, frozen fries, dried out chicken, limp, cheap ubiquitous salad, no taste tomotos and a very sad chicken souvklaki sandwich later we left never to return"}
{"text":"Have been coming here since it opened last year. Last summer this place was a guaranteed 3-4 stars (consistently). In recent months, however, their food has not met 3 star standards. They have also raised their food prices quite a bit, which unfortunately, no longer correlates with the quality of food. Too bad, as they really had a good thing going there for a while -early success may have gotten to their head? If you want an authentic, reasonably priced gyros, head a couple of blocks south to Suv Like."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Worst customer service and over priced!! I ordered food and it took over and hour and a half to arrive. When it did it was cold, and soggy. I have lived locally for years and am warning everyone do not order, or eat here."}
{"text":"So I frequented this place because of a friend's recommendation. The first time was amazing Greek food compared to many others. There was a large portion of food and the chicken souvlaki was juicy and well done. However the more I visited this place to eat, I noticed that my first visit was not a even close to consistent service they provide. My food and customer service experience had been getting worse and worse over time. The chicken is dry and burnt tasting.I no longer go to this place for Greek food any more unless I'm super hungry and want a big portion of food.  Overall I give this place two stars on food and service. If you want a nice portion, give this place a shot.   Also it is open late which is convenient. But like most places they run out of all the good food after 11 which leaves a 2-3 hour gap of really only one option to choose from."}
{"text":"If you want a gyros that is exactly like Greece... This is the place to come to.   It's so perfect."}
{"text":"Dropped by Tzatziki last week to have lunch with my collogue, a friendly lady was working in the kitchen. She seemed out of order she dropped what seem to be the cutting knife for the  gyro on the ground and picked up and continued as if nothing happen.  I was with my collogue I didn't want to make a deal about it since I recommended the place to him, but it was very unprofessional and unsanitary thing to do. So again I went there tonight alone this time to get take out. I ordered two pork gyros on a pita no onion extra Tzatziki, with much excitement I got to see the cook picking his nose as I came out of the bathroom this was after I paid for my gyros. I asked the man for his name and his respond was (KIMON sir how are you) I tolled him great thanks. I did pick up a menu and I will be contacting the owners of this restaurant as well as the health department. I absolutely was appalled.  Richard G."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times over this past year.  In the beginning, I really raved about this new fresh place so close to home.  The food was really the best Old School Greek cuisine in the area.  The owner was friendly and attentive and the coffee shop next door was an added bonus; they also make the best loukoumades.  Alas, I can only give them 3 stars because the quality of their food is now inconsistent.  The prices have gone up quite a bit but have not been updated on their website.  Every time I have ordered a beer or glass of wine it has been warm.  And the service is going downhill.  Calling for take-out is difficult because they don't answer the phone.   More recently, our server was rude.  We were one of only 2 tables in the place when our order was taken but then others who arrived after us were being served before us.  After waiting for 30 minutes with no food we asked what's up and told our server we had tickets to an event and needed to be out in the next 2o minutes.  The server was surly and we were borderline berated, being told that everything there was made from scratch (we could see the kitchen was only just putting our orders on the grill after we asked about our order).  Walk-ins for take out were getting their food before us.  Slow service is one thing but when you get defensive and make your customers feel that they are to blame for your mistake, it doesn't matter how good the food is. I'll go elsewhere from now on.   There are lots of other good choices in the area so no need to put up with that kind of treatment."}
{"text":"I gave this place a shot, seeing that they seemed to have a good crowd coming in, food looked good, etc.. so i figured what the heck. Very disappointing. Ordered takeout. Small chicken souvlaki plate - meat was dry, overcooked and basically tasted like burnt charcoal. Also ordered a chicken gyro plate - meat was slimy and flavourless, looked like a shredded rotisserie chicken. Gross. How is this a gyro?!?! Greek salad tasted like nothing, just bland with some oil and chunks of flavourless feta.  And the kicker...THEY FORGOT TO PUT TZATZIKI IN MY TAKEOUT BAG!! Despite the overall horrible experience, I couldn't help but laugh at the irony in this. Forgetting tzatziki is kind of an important detail, given the name of your establishment.  Sorry, will be crossing this one off my list."}
{"text":"Tonight, after getting home from a vacation to Cyprus and being absolutely exhausted from the airport experience and the timezone difference, we decided to do something we had already previously decided never to do: order from tzatziki again. Past visits had led us to that decision because of the insane prices and much better options in the area. But we just wanted to get something into our mouths by putting in as little effort as possible, so across the street was the best option.   I called and asked for a large pork gyro dinner with potatoes and instead of rice I asked if I could just get extra salad. The woman on the phone responded in a friendly way, sure no problem and told me my order would be ready in 15 mins. I sent my boyfriend across the street 15 mins later to go pick it up and he comes back quickly with food in hand, $18 less in pocket. We open it and notice three things: this is a small meal, not a large (we have recently had the same meal) and there are no potatoes and certainly not extra salad. So boyfriend goes back to explain the issues to the woman but she would not hear it. Apparently this was a large meal and it did indeed have extra salad and I had said that I wanted only a salad on the phone, no potatoes. No apologies, no offers to fix it. He was too exhausted to argue further so he just came back home and we ate it (in the interest of full disclosure, it was pretty tasty) all the while cursing them and laughing at our terrible luck and vowing repeatedly to never ever ever  eat here again.   Now, neither one of us is the type to complain about food or customer service..raw loukoumades, a bit of hair in the food, waiter doesn't smile ..eh, whatever. I'll live, y'know? This is my first bad review of anything ever. Honestly, speaking as a local, Tzatziki is a complete and utter waste of your money and you are better off supporting businesses that actually care about their customers and the community. Some great gyro places on Pape are Folia Grill at cosburn or for late night gyros, souvlike at danforth. Louis meat market and Alexandros on danforth and Logan are great options too.   You might luck out and get good service and good food at tzatziki but you also probably will not and you'll definitely pay too much for it so why take the risk?"}
{"text":"Been a few times and love the chicken souvlaki pitas. Good quality meat, good meat to sauce ratio, and great with hot sauce. Always friendly when I pick up takeout."}
{"text":"Ordered a simple meal for delivery. Food arrived late and cold. Missing one item and another was wrong. Not spending money here again."}
{"text":"So it was my first time eating here. I ordered delivery, 1 pork souvlaki and 1 chicken souvlaki dinner. For starters when I called I was placed on hold for about 5 minutes. The girl I spoke to was rude and clearly more occupied with somebody/something else. She screwed up my phone # twice, my name and worst of all our orders (both of them). This was the saltiest thing I've eaten in a long time. I would not go again."}
{"text":"Cute little cozy restaurant just north of the Danforth with a decent size patio.  Server was welcoming and friendly upon our arrival.  Time between ordering and delivery of drinks plus food was reasonable.  Server checked on us once, but readily refilled our glasses of water at appropriate times.  Menu was standard Greek fare and plenty of selection for everyone's tastebuds. Prices were very reasonable, but perhaps it'll be nice if they had a lunch menu to make ordering a little easier. Plus make the blackboard specials a little more visible or have the server inform us of the specials.  We both ordered the chicken souvlaki small platter for $12 and portions were good.  Two skewers of chicken, roasted potatoes, salad and rice.  Came with pita bread and small bowl of tzatziki sauce. For a restaurant named Tzatziki, it was fitting as the tzatziki was very delicious.  You can definitely taste the garlic, but it wasn't too overpowering and the consistency was nice and smooth.  We practically finished the whole tzatziki bowl very easily.  I definitely will consider coming here again if I feel like having Greek cuisine and want to stray away from the busy Danforth area."}
{"text":"This was my absolute favorite place to get Greek food. The gyros actually tasted like they were from the islands. Unfortunately the food quality went to hell. The pita tastes days old, they only put half the amount of meat they used to put, and their tzatziki is watery. I used to travel all the way from Richmond hill just to have a gyro. Now I guess it's back to Messini."}
{"text":"Early on, this place was pretty good.  The food was pretty decent and fresh.  A short time after, everything started going downhill.  The service is decent but nothing to give a 20% tip over.  In fact, I feel like 15% is unjustified at times.  The food, well, it's pretty crap.    The gyros are always dry and at times taste as if they're days old.  Same with lemon potatoes.  You can tell they're not fresh because they have slime all over them, and are mushy -- they definitely look and tasted days old.  One bite, and you'll spit it back out.  A complete abomination.  And the rice, so far, the theme has been days old.  Why should it change? It's tasteless, bland, dry and really nothing else to it.  So easy, a 5 year old can make it.  Hard not to guess the ingredients are rice, water, and a knor cube.  No different than boiling down a package of Mr Noodle.  What a scam.  The food and the prices are a reflection on the complete stupidity and idiocy of this operation."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I have given them a lot of chances, but I'm just done. The people working there have generally been extremely rude to us, for example they used to have vegetables on the menu as a side dish option and when I ordered them they made me feel stupid for asking as though I should have known. They are not very clean, the cooks are sweaty and use their bare hands. The service is slow (upwards of 30 min) and on two occasions I have seen their Greek friends or family who ordered after us get their food first. You are made to feel like an outsider. The prices are very high ($12 for a village salad) and portions not very large, better to just go up the street to Folia or Greek Grill, or to Danforth for any of their places. Really, go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Despite wanting to love this restaurant, it has only disappointed me. I gave the place five tries, but each time the chicken and pork souvlaki was dry and the rice was also on the dry side. Two of the five times I got takeout and the first time they forgot to the fries and there was no dressing on the salad, and then the second time they forgot the salad. After reading other reviews, this seems to be a common experience. If you're going to get takeout here, don't leave until you've checked that everything you paid for is in the bag."}
{"text":"Would not eat here again!   I came here at the recommendation of a friend who said this place was better than Messini's. Boy was she wrong!   This place does look much cleaner than Messini's but the food was awful. I wouldn't even eat here if I was completely wasted, starving, and nothing else was open.   The food was crap. The service was crap. The prices seemed higher than Messini's as well.   The only reason why I give it a 1 star is because they have a little patio.   If you are hungry stick to Messini's--although the customer service sucks at Messini's, the food is reliable and good."}
{"text":"I don't know what is going on with this place , They don't EVER listen to what you ask for. E-v-e-r-y single time I order here they mess up my order completely and skimp out on half their food. They literally couldn't care less about their food or job or restaurant and is sadly shows."}
{"text":"Look - the food is good.  Generally speaking it's on par with the best Greek fast food in East York, it's just WAY overpriced.  If you don't mind paying $20pp+ for take out then go for it.   Great to have a little spot on the Pape strip but their exclusivity may have gone to their heads.   If they didn't raise prices I'd give them a 4."}
{"text":"Ate here today and have to say two things:  1) The food was delicious 2) The customer service was well below par   This location is one of my favourite take out spots, but I had never personally eaten in-store before, I had only ever ordered uber eats. Today I brought my boyfriend and his parents here for his birthday, and although the food was delicious, the service was extremely disappointing.  The waitress was forgetful and clearly had no experience below her belt. Both myself and my boyfriends mother are experienced servers, so we were very upset with how things were handled. It took almost ten minutes for us to receive menus upon being seated, despite the location being very small and having only one other table there upon arrival. We promptly placed our orders and it took a very long time for our drinks, and by the time we had finished our drinks, I had to ask the waitress where our appetizer was. Our appetizer was only a bowl of tzatziki with some bread, and it took almost a half an hour until we received it. Once I asked her where it was, it was immediately evident that she had forgotten to put our order in, and it took an additional ten minutes until we received it. Our food arrived once we had been there for almost an hour, and one at a time, with a couple minutes in between, something that is such an industry no-no. On top of that, we had to ask for refills and napkins.   I would highly recommend that this location put some effort into hiring experienced and professional servers, or train their current staff into the do's and don'ts of serving. Asides from that, the food is very delicious, so this place has a lot of promise. I would highly recommend ordering for pick up or uber eats for now."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken souvlaki pita wrap to go.  The chef seemed angry and was yelling at everybody.  I'm guessing he was the boss.  Maybe that was his way of talking to the employees.  Everyone seemed stressed out cause of this guy.  There was a lot of confusion behind the counter, and the cashier looked lost when I ordered.  So much that after I ordered, she handed me my receipt.  Then I handed her the money cause she thought I had paid already.  She was like 'oops!'.  Finally the chef made my wrap.  Almost forgot to add the fries to it.  Overall, the wrap was tasty.  For $8+tax, I'd rather go to other places around the Danforth.  The portion here was much smaller.  Not worth me ever returning again.  C.L."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time w these rude people. Honestly. They treat you like crap and yell at people and their food isn't handled well and has zero consistency you never know what you're getting. You literally don't get what you order most of the time for takeout. The owner yells at his servers in front of people. They're disorganized. They forget to make your order in the cue.   Last time I went I was waiting in line and I saw the old guy owner on the grill reach his bare hand into a prep tub of tomatoes to pull out a hair and then use the tomatoes in a gyro right after. I walked out and I haven't gone back since.   Tonight I went in to pick up an order giving them one last chance and same thing: No hair nets. No gloves. No hat on cook. His bare hands fishing in food after touching sweaty forehead and face. Ew.   Food we got home, which I didn't even feel like eating anymore, was inconsistent again and a new fun ingredient they add to skepasti and gyros now is  'Greek sauce' which is thousand island dressing. What's Greek about that guys? Gross. And the roasted potatoes I ordered were literally whole potatoes with some oil drizzled on them with hardly any spices. I wouldn't have even known this had I not checked the containers in my car. When I went back and told them I ordered roasted potatoes like the lemon ones they used to serve they rudely said \"Ya those are too labour intensive we don't make those anymore! We have these now.\" Doesn't say so on the website at all. I wasn't given any other options. I asked for tzatziki to go with them. They begrudgingly slapped some in a takeaway.   You've lost my biz guys. I don't know who you think you are but you have to follow health codes and not be total jerks.   Good luck."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around noon and it wasn't too busy.  Pros: - Nice ambiance - Good service  Cons: - No parking - Pricey for the quantity offered especially since Messini isn't too far.  - Meat quality is sub par"}
{"text":"Terrrrrrible service.   Offends me as a Greek.  I went in to order & they ignored me for about 5 min.  A \"hi, be with you in a minute sir\" would be nice guys!  Food is ok, but u won't survive with such S*^t service.  If u ask for something different or extra, good luck getting it with these clowns!  My wife recently had a similar bad experience. never again."}
{"text":"I live crazy close to this place and was hoping for great greek food, but a little disappointed. I ordered the chicken gyro with all the fixins, and it was so incredibly dry, I just about choked. If I hadn't taken it to go, I probably would have returned it. The greek salad was a little bland...nothing to write home about. Will try it again, maybe eat in next time and try one of the dinners."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Great service. The chicken souvlaki was over seasoned and the salad was over dressed."}
{"text":"I love Greek food, and I think it's safe to say it's my favourite cuisine. But for the past few years I've struggled to find a truly great Greek restaurant that delivers to downtown Toronto. I think I may have finally found my place.  I tried out their chicken souvlaki dinner and it did not disappoint! The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooks. The potatoes were very lemony (if I'm being overly critical I would maybe say they border on being almost too lemony and verging on bitter) and their rice is excellent. The Greek salad is made with very fresh ingredients, and features a simple oil and vinegar dressing (how authentic!). While I might have preferred a slightly more flavourful dressing, it's better than what you get from most delivery places (read: packaged).  And we mustn't forget the Tzatziki, their namesake. It was some of the best I've ever tasted. Fresh, creamy, with plenty of garlic (this is not for garlic haters). I ordered a side of it, mostly so my order would qualify for delivery, and received a rather sizeable container of it, which I cannot complain about!  The food is fresh, and delicious. The portion sizes are quite large, which is great if you want left-overs for your lunch the next day (I suggest opting for the large if that's that case). The price isn't bad either! It's pricer than, say, delivery pizza, but it's much fresher and a whole lot better for you. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The best gyros in the city hands down!  If you've ever been to Greece then you'll understand that they have come as close to the real thing as possible.  I've been over 10 times and have yet to be disappointed.  I will say the service staff are a little inconsistent but in all honesty I find this to be the case at most restaurants,  high end to low end.  The gyro is definitely the centre piece to this restaurant,  they do everything else very well also but go for the gyro!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today .. was very disappointed.. from the cook to the food .. I ordered gyros dinner I  asked to substitute my sides to Greek fries only .. the cook said that it would be too much fries .. I thought to myself who's eating them him or me .. the gyros was very salty .. also ordered saganaki it arrived burnt .. I will not be returning or recommending  this Resturant to anyone"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to give Tzatziki a good review, as the first time we ordered take out during their Grand Opening, the food was amazing (huge portions, LOTS of extra tzatziki, great flavours). However, a week ago, we decided to order take out again and unfortunately, our experience wasn't even close to what it was the first time. Once we got home with our food, we realized that they had forgotten to give us our Greek Fries. I called them and spoke with a girl who asked me in an accusatory tone, \"Did you pay for them?\" - I found this ridiculous, as why would I call about my missing fries if I didn't pay for them? (This was after I spent $40 dollars on dinner.. .not likely I would lie about having paid for a $4 order of fries.) After pressing the issue some more, she agreed to have the missing fries delivered. We live a 5 minute drive away, and it took them almost an hour to get the fries to us. The lady I spoke to on the phone was rude and condescending when I called back to ask them where they were. She blamed me for giving her the wrong address (which is completely untrue, seeing as how I live at the address so I know what it is and she spewed off something that sounded completely different; it was more likely a result of her not paying attention), then she argued with me about what \"east of Coxwell\" means.  After a good 45 minutes of waiting, I called back again to ask her where the driver was, and to ask her how it could possibly take so long, and she interrupted and yelled at me and told me to let her talk and then lied and said the driver had a flat tire. Ummm... such a huge lie, as she named an address that is just down the street from my house and I went to take a look and there was no car there with a flat tire.   Besides the horrible service, the meat was very dry this time around. Even if the food improves, I would never go back here again. There are so many other Greek spots on the Danforth, why would I subject myself to this kind of service?"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Saw the cook sneeze over the grill full of souvlaki. That was an omen....But it was not my food he sneezed on so I took my chances as I was hungry. Grabbed my food and left. Once I got home we discovered they shorted us a greek fries. Called back and after some prodding they offered to deliver us the missing dish.  We gave them the address. In short it took close to an hour after to get our greek fries. They went to the wrong address and then yelled at my girlfriend over the phone, lied about getting a flat tire ( we drove to the spot they said he was stuck at) Bad experience overall. The souvlaki was dry and overcooked. There are soooo may greek places in this neck of the woods. Give this one a pass."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite pork gyro spot, but I don't think they are always consistent which is a shame. That's why I give 3 stars. You need to be there when the gyros are newly made and still thick, otherwise you get the inner remnants when the gyro is cut down thin and has been cooking for a while, containing alot of fat and connective tissue. Im pretty sure they put a lemon sauce on my pork last time to mask this, when they hadn't previously. Fries and rice are usually good when they are made fresh. The dips are great but I found the olive one to be too salty. Salad is good but the flavour can be stronger at times. The tzaziki is the highlight, as it should be. Hope you'll have a good experience here."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Ordered about 40$ worth of food with my boyfriend. Wait time: 2 hours. Food? Specified NO CHEESE on one wrap as there was an allergy. It came with cheese so I could not eat my wrap at all. The rice was eh, the potatoes were inedible as they tasted like they were crusted in straight up salt, and the fries were cold and soggy. Worst waste of money ever. Ended up having to grab other food cause I couldn't my wrap or the other food. Wouldn't order if someone forced me to."}
{"text":"This place is interesting. I ordered take-out from this restaurant with some friends.   The good: food is great. The meat is well seasoned, the veg is good. The best part are the dips. They are amazing, especially the olive dip.  The part that needs work: customer service. In my case, the food was delivered but it was well over an hour. The small restaurant can get crazy. The order was correct but they screwed up my address and phone number. Luckily, the driver figured it out.  Bottom line: despite the service, I will try them again (but order earlier). The food was worth a second try."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best; customer service is absolute sh*t. Ordered a chicken souvlaki, arrived with no chicken in it. Also took 20 minutes for them to come back with the correct order while my partner's food sat there cold as he waited for me. Hire more staff to suit your customer needs rather than one person doing the work of hosts/server/reception. Better restaurants on the Danforth.  Note: I wrote this exact review on their Facebook page. I made a typo and said \"Ordered chicken souvlaki and arrived with chicken in it\" (I meant to say \"arrived with NO\" chicken in it). They replied to me the next day mocking me saying \"if I ordered chicken and received chicken, I'd be upset too.\" Obviously I wouldn't just complain for the sake of it; I had reason. Thanks for showing how professional you guys can be."}
{"text":"Waaay overpriced for a chicken souvlaki and chicken gyro! And my chicken souvlaki was undercooked- which led to stomach issues a few hours later! I don't get the hype totally disappointing..."}
{"text":"This was a solid & fast lunch. It was a Chicken Gyro with French fries included on it. Also had hot peppers which was a delicious addition. Very nice & certainly a do-over!"}
{"text":"This review is based on multiple visits over the span of 6 months.  My first visit was in November 2014. Great service, delicious food & at a price point that was reasonable.  My second visit was for take out, similar to the first.. Fast service, delicious food. Definitely no complaints.  Our third visit should have been a clear indication of how this place was losing its momentum. The service was slow, the food was lukewarm when we finally got it & then it took another 30 minutes just to get the bill.  Our last visit was the final straw. We decided to order online through their website. Got to the restaurant about 45 minutes after placing the order & the girl at the cash couldn't find our order. She then called someone else over, who pointed at a printer with our order receipt clearly just sitting there with no intention on being processed.  They apologized & said it would be ready in 5 minutes.  20 minutes later, we notice the our take out order sitting on plates waiting to be served. It sat on the counter for another 10 minutes before the waiter said they accidentally plated it & then another 5 before it was even put in take out containers.  Long story short, I wouldn't return here. The food was great months ago but it's clearly gone downhill."}
{"text":"Dry. Bland. Expensive.  During daylight hours, take the short trip up Pape to Folia Grill for the best-in-city stuff.  At 3 am weekend, take the trip down Pape to Souv Like for something better."}
{"text":"Been here on 4 different occasions (both sober and not sober) and absolutely loved my gyros, Greek fries were on the decent side but could be better but just managed to hit the spot! Recommend highly especially since Messini's became to inconsistent for me to want to return there despite their superior Greek fries."}
{"text":"Ordered a small chicken gyro dinner tonight.  Delish!  If you're looking to avoid the rush of the Danforth with Danforth quality food, I'd give them a whirl."}
{"text":"Usually go for a quick bite, however on this night the regular cooks were not there. I could tell the cook was new by how slow he was wrapping the gyros. There was a woman who ordered to go as I sat down to order in. When I saw how humongous the woman's gyro was I waited in anticipation for mine as I was next up and starving. I had ordered a gyro, salad and a drink. To my dismay the gyro had the least amount of meat I have ever had in a gyro. First time I left hungry after $22"}
{"text":"This place is SUCH a pleasant surprise. I ordered a Greek salad with chicken sticks and was truly impressed (I think being impressed with salad takes some doing). The salad was fresh and crispy, the meat was plump and well seasoned. Lots of veggies and big hunks of feta. They had both sides of the corner lot windows open for a nice breeze. It was super casual and lovely."}
