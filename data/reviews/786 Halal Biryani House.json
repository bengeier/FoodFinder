{"text":"I ordered for delivery a couple of days ago and I have one word DISGUSTING. I took one bite of the Desi Ghee paratha and I was certain it had been out for days, not to mention it was totally burnt. Samosas were equally as bad.  I got the the chicken tikka masala aswell (a dish you can hardly go wrong with in any decent indian/pakistani establishment). The chicken tasted funny, gagged a little bit (not exaggerating) and the sauce hardly had flavour.  The chana masala and the butter naan I got were the lesser of evils or so I thought. I fell sick the next day, spent most of my time in the washroom the next few days. Thanks 786 halal Biryani house. I'm appalled at the lack of quality, this place shouldnt be allowed to serve food."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan, mostly because of the young fella serving us in the rainy Tuesday evening, as he just made everything the best.  We were the only customers around 8 PM. Had chickpea dahl and naan. The guy made the naan bread, which was the best I have ever had. Chckpeas were warmed in the microwave of course and complimentary jug with water was poured to styrofoam cups.   There are indeed plenty of Indian food classics here and what makes the decision easier, is they have many photos of the foods on the wall, so you can see what you are getting.  Service and very delicious chickpeas made us to love this place. Not a fancy, but yet clean place with not a very nice washroom though. But food is cheap and so good. Paid for our shared dinner $ 6.74, that included two naan breads and meal + water, unfortunately they had run out of salad, so no salad for us.  As much as I am a food lover I love people, and I love when they do their job with passion even in such a late hour. Respect. Recommend for tasty and cheap food. We will continue our adventures there."}
{"text":"There are plenty of Indian food classics here. I think they make their own naan bread. I had the barbequed chicken and aloo palak. All the food was good and very cheap. They are also open 24 hours which is a real bonus. It's cab driver food. *****  CLOSED"}
{"text":"\"Worst indian resturant in the GTA\"  Ugly decor and horrible location. They had picnic table clothes for their tables. The place was very dirty they never clean the place. The food is just horrible, tasted very old, bland and clearly it as microwaved. Especially their Chicken Biryani, it tasted very bland no flavors and tasted like it was in the microwave. The chicken in the other hand was also bland tasted like rubber with no seasonings and it was very DRY. Worst texture for a chicken!  When i asked for a glass of water, they gave me a styrofoam cup with water and even the water tasted odd. Clearly it was in that  werid looking water jug/pitcher for days and they haven't bother changing the water or maybe cleaning the jug/pitcher. After a few hours I felt sick. This is the worst resturant experiance I've had in a resturant.  If your looking for a decent indian resturant do not come here you will be wasting your time and of course your money.   You're better off somewhere else.  Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Ewww GROSS!! I ordered the butter chicken and garlic nan. Got to work and opened it up and took one bite. Disgusting. The nan smelled great but didn't seem to have the right consistency or texture."}
{"text":"I got a special: 1 meat, veggie and two sauces, or something like that. The meal itself was great very delicious. But within half an hour I could barely walk and for the next two days I was stuck in bed from food poisoning.   Yea, I won't be eating here again..."}
