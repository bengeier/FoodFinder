{"text":"lovely small french restaurant, mostly crepes plus specials.  had dinner on a friday, really good, nothing too elaborate but everything was done with care and expertise.  the owner-chef lady is a delight. there was a wine tasting event, extra bonus, which was a steal, a generous 4 flight for $10.  there will be lines out the door if/when this place gets discovered."}
{"text":"Absolutely flawless dining experience! We made reservations here for the first time on the occasion of my wife's birthday. The waitress was very attentive and each course of our dinner just got better and better. We started out by ordering a Loire Valley white wine: a Vouvray demi-sec which immediately wowed us. We ordered cold soups as our appetizers: she had the Gazpacho and I ordered the cucumber soup. I think the gazpacho edged out the cucumber soup but both were superb. My wife ordered the Chicken Doria and I had the Tartiflette Gratinee served with side salads. These appear to be fairly simple dishes but the flavor and textures were fondly reminiscent of meals we loved while my parents lived in Europe. We shared each other's plates and while these dishes appeared overly filling, they were actually just right.  We ordered more wine and our dessert was presented with a birthday candle and a bit of fanfare from Chef Nanou herself. The lavender Creme Brule was probably the best we have tasted. I had the Cherry Clafouti and was not disappointed - we were so very impressed by this excellent meal and with our waitress who seemed to always magically appear whenever we even thought to ask about something. Chef Nanou came out twice to see how we were. What a gracious and charming host!   I rarely think to write a restaurant review unless we are very unhappy about a terrible experience or extremely happy about a fabulous experience! This was happily the latter case!"}
{"text":"Totally excellent small restaurant.  Savory crepes.  Friendly owner."}
{"text":"Quite simply, a wonderful date night. The server was delightful and the owner/chef was absolutely charming. Highly recommend the lavender creme brûlée and lemon tart. This is way we choose locally owned and operated establishments. Such a treat to have in Madison."}
{"text":"I had an awesome, great experience at Chez Nanou. So glad I got a chance to come out here before leaving the city. It's a super cozy place that gives a homely feeling. The owners would come out every so often to say hi and to chat. We were a party of two, and got seated immediately for brunch at this nice little corner by the windows overlooking the streets. The table was nicely made with little flowers and ornaments, perfect with a couple, or a good friend, I love it at once.   We went there for... crepes! A lot of crepes. Had the parsienne, a savory crepe with ham, mushroom, béchamel and Swiss cheese. I love cheesy mushroom crepes, the ones here are so fresh and the béchamel sauce adds a creamy texture to it all. The dessert crepes complete our day and make us yearn for more. Love the nutella crepe and lemon curd crepe. The hazelnut chocolate complements very well with the citrus lemon. We also had the omelette, which was great though I prefer the crepes more.   The service was awesome. We were made to feel very welcome and had all our questions answered. Wonderful experience overall and I'll be back the next time I'm in town. Do note their opening hours, dinners and weekend brunch only."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to come here for awhile so we came for Sunday brunch today and it was fantastic. The service was as great as the meal with friendly and attentive staff. We ordered coffee and tea along with the baguette and preserves. All was delicious and high quality. We also ordered two savory creeps. The first was the pear, walnut and goat cheese, and the second was the bacon potato and gruyere. They had great texture and flavor. For dessert we had the lemon curd crepe which was amazing. We plan to return for brunch and dinner. I really want to try the French onion soup!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was absolutely amazing  unfortunately our service was piss pour. Honestly  the worst I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small, but nicely decorated, parking is limited. There are around 12-15 small tables in a very small space. We have ordered ASSIETTE de CHARCUTERIE ($14) which consisted of  meat cuts of supermarket quality, nothing special. We had TARTIFLETTE ($16) which was a mixture of white potatoes, supermarket quality bacon and white sauce (butter, flour, milk), covered with some cheese and baked in the oven. The dish was greasy, no thrills cooking, reminiscent of no famed French food and overpriced, as the ingredients were very cheap. Another dish we tried was SMOKED SALMON PLATE ($16). It seemed like they just opened supermarket quality smoked salmon package, placed it on the plate, put 5 red onion rings on it and declared it an entry for $16. No cooking invoved with this dish. In addition, they were low on bread, so we were expected to eat a big quantity of  smoked salmon with 4 pieces of baguet.  The rose wine was cheap too, but priced highly. My general impression was that they are trying to serve the cheapest possible ingredients at highest prices possible under the French bistro gimmick. Interestingly, there are no meat entrees in Chez Nanou...  I would highly recommend to avoid this place and instead to go to near by French restaurants Sardines or Graze which deliver bold flavors, creative cooking at the same price point of $15 per plate and a great wine list."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and every time is fantastic. Everything we've had has been amazing.  Service is impeccable and the food is divine!"}
{"text":"On one of the first Springy Sundays of the year, my wife and I decided to try the brunch at Chez Nanou. We reserved a table, which was easy to do online, and we're greeted pleasantly at the door by the one server, who was doubling as a host. Other couples came in and we're able to find immediate seating. Apparently the word of brunch here is not out yet.  Let's start with the food because that's what matters. My wife ordered the Savoyarde crepes, which were delightfully creamy and rustic, though thicker than expected. Being buckwheat crepes, they were also gluten free, as were many of the offerings. We shared a cup of the soup du jour, which was stellar. As I am a lover of bread, I ordered the brioche French toast with apple cinnamon, and I haven't been able to forget it since the first bite. With just a hint of sweetness and spice, the bread was superb and tender, with just the right bit of crustiness from the pan. Served with a delicate creme fraiche and a nice sampling of honey, every bite was unique and marvelous. The apples tasted like they were exhumed from a fresh pie, cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was, without question, the best French toast I've ever had in a restaurant.  Chez Nanou, at first glance, seems hyper conscious of its Frenchness. It is a small space, bedecked with posters for wine and other sundries, photographs of romanticized lavender fields, and a gratuitous number of Provençal and Parisian scenes, including a watercolor of Le Moulin Rouge, indistinguishable from other watercolors of that spinning landmark. It's decidedly cheesy chezy, but there are minute, charming touches that make up for it. In the entryway, taped to an old world kitchen rack, is an enshrined empty bottle of a 1959 French vintage accompanied by typed letter in French from the patron who donated it explaining its provenance. Should you be curious as to the translation, grab one of the books from the Little Free French Library in the back, and practice at home, or over a plate of something delicious. Amusez-vous bien!"}
{"text":"We tried to go to Forequarter, but there was a two-hour wait, so instead we decided to try this place, where none in our party had been before. And what a huge treat! The food was divine, the service attentive, and the atmosphere was downright darling. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Chez Nanou Friday night. There were so many yummy sounding options that I'll have to go back soon! It's quite a small space so I would recommend making a reservation as diners tend to linger.   Pros- Great selection of charcuterie and French cheeses Specials highlight seasonal ingredients, fresh and delicious Espresso  Amazing deserts  Cons- Don't go to Chez Nanou if you're in a rush. As long as you enjoy a long relaxing meal and have good company to talk to you'll love it!"}
{"text":"What a lovely place. Just charming.  There is no doubt what kind of food you're in for here, and it's like being hugged by your mom, if she was born in the south of France. I went with the special mushroom soup to start, then the entrée of the night: a cordon bleu, which came with lightly and expertly fried potatoes and a nicely fresh side of greens. My lovely date's app also pleased: a salmon/apple/cucumber/dill creation that was thoroughly enjoyed. Her buckwheat crepe entrée worked well.   If you like creme brulee, the lavender-infused dessert is a must. If you don't like creme brulee, you are a sad, sad soul.  Reasonable prices. Attentive service, including a visit from the chef herself. What a gem."}
{"text":"What a great lunch! I visited Chez Nanou today with my parents and was pretty impressed overall. The place is cozy and comfortable, with beautiful decorations and the perfect music. I had the Montagnarde crepe--brie, prosciutto, and an egg on top. The buckwheat crepe is really hearty, and it came with a little side salad to wash everything down. My dad had the French onion soup and my mom had a nicoise salad. I'm not a fan of either dish in general, but they said each was amazing. Then we split two sweet crepes: nutella and lemon curd. Fresh from the griddle and delicious!  Our only complaint was the slow service (I think a few other people here noticed it as well). But, it's two days before Christmas so they seemed to be down their usual staff, and Nanou makes each dish herself in the kitchen, so I guess that should be expected.   I wish I lived in Madison so I could come here more often! I think I will try the Norvegienne crepe next."}
{"text":"This is lovely and couzy place to eat authentic and amazingly  crafted french food. The decor  is extremely  welcoming as well as the staff. I came here for Christmas eve lunch with  my parents and both loved the food and place, which is difficult  since they don't  like to eat out. I would recommend  this for a romantic  date or to anybody  who likes little and cute places that offer high quality food."}
{"text":"I love how friendly and homely this place is. Feels just like being at a family-run cafe in Europe. The decorations are all pictures of France, the cute little lace curtain that covers only the bottom half of the window, a bar table at the window just for two - perfect for people watching...!!!  I must comment that since this place is really small, there was only one waitress who attended to the 15 or so customers. You must definitely be prepared to wait if you arrive after 12pm for brunch. However, with wonderful company and the relaxing ambience, the wait is not bad at all - maybe 30-40 minutes for food. There was no wait for seats on the other hand, so you get a comfortable seat and water or drinks to quench your thirst!  Now now now, the highlights! of course, food.  I tried the croque madame - good but not wowing. I definitely enjoyed the crispy ends of the bread, but not all ends were crispy. I loved the creamy cheese but the bacon was a little salty.. The egg was kinda separate from the whole croque madame. I also prefer the egg to be more runny.  The highlight was my friend's dish, which was a special item - the Chicken Dijon. ohhhhhhh how i love this baked casserole. chicken, cheese, rice with a pink sauce. oh it is the most wonderful casserole I've had in a while. very delicious and substantial.  I also tried my other friend's omelette - mushroom, onions and spring onions. do note that the onions were not mentioned in the menu, but were still included in the omelette. I enjoyed the omelette, gigantic portion and very generous with the ingredients. The flavor was good but the egg was a little too cooked for me on the outside. I like my eggs more runny.  We then ended our brunch with dessert! Cafe Gourmand had bite size tastings of the creme brûlée (with lavender flavor, a little on the strong side), lemon curd tart, a milk custard like thing with almonds, cookie and nutella crepe. I LOVE the nutella crepe, it was more american styled as it was rather thick. still, the bite size version makes it the most adorable thing in the world!!! Also, you get an espresso or coffee with the Cafe Gourmand!  In summary, I would visit on a day when I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere, when I've good company. The food is delicious enough for me to return, and service is really homely and friendly but I usually get too hungry and restless if I wait too long...   P.S. Chez Nanou is such a kind friendly lady, she came out to greet everyone in the restaurant, table by table. She made sure we enjoyed her dishes!"}
{"text":"It was good, but it was a lot like food I cook at home but not as healthy. So...I guess if I'm feeling too tired to cook but want the taste of home cooking? I don't know. The server was really nice and I overheard her mention to another couple that the owner (which is the head chef) was out that week, so maybe we were just there on an off week."}
{"text":"I have worked on this side of town for multiple years, and had honestly never noticed this restaurant until my drive in this morning. I knew I needed to go there for lunch.  Hastily corralling a work friend, we headed to Chez Nanou. I easily found street parking, and we headed in. I wasn't really sure what to do as I walked in as there was no greeter desk (and I never know if I should wait to be seated or seat myself ANYWHERE that there isn't a host!) We wandered over to the register and a lady popped out of the kitchen very quickly. She invited us to sit anywhere we wanted, and we picked a table for two by the half-covered-with-rustic-French-lace windows. It seats probably about 20 people, and there were 7 others there when we arrived.   I cannot tell you how excited I was to find a real creperie, and even more excited to hear that the chef was French. It just made it all feel more authentic.  We looked through the small but ample menu, and I selected the Crepe Parisienne (Ham, mushrooms, Gruyère, béchamel), while my friend chose the Sucre Sale (Pear, walnuts, goat cheese, honey). All savory crepes are made from buckwheat, so they are gluten free. They were absolutely amazing. A nice sized portion (slightly smaller crepe than you get from the food carts in Paris) but choc-full of creamy goodness, my Parisienne was served with a lightly seasoned and incredibly fresh tasting salad.   Cons? It was a little pricy ($13 for my Parisienne), and the service was not speedy, but this didn't stop the five stars. It doesn't advertise itself as a fast food restaurant, and I appreciated that things were literally being made from scratch for me.   The ambience was fabulous, it felt very authentically French, and I have to admit to rounding out my meal with a really good Nutella crepe. How could I not? I'll be heading back very soon!"}
{"text":"Chez Nanou is this place you want to go not just for a lovely meal but also a warm, cozy and relaxing evening! Their décor and style of dining made you feel like you are in someone's dining room.  They have a number of options for lunch and dinner, including gratins, salmon and savory crepes. I tried their mushroom gratin, which is rich and very homely. They also have daily specials available, like the tapenade and apple pepper cream soup I tried, both very flavorable and appetizing!  Last but not least, their wonderful selection of French wine and their signature dessert, lavender crème brûlée, also made it a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little place in the heart of Madison. Having lived in France before, I feel at home here. Yes, the service is not super fast, but that's exactly the point; If you need fast food, go to McDonalds! But if you want to sit down, relax, enjoy good food and a pleasant environment, this is the place to go. It's a bit on the pricey side, but I don't mind paying for something I truly enjoy.  P.S.: This is not a French haute cuisine restaurant, so level your expectations accordingly. Very good food nonetheless!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute place, but otherwise I wasn't entirely impressed. The service was really slow and the food wasn't all that great. I could have made something better at home.   My guy and I met with some friends for brunch one Saturday. I love French food so I was really excited. Crepes? Yes please!   I ordered the mushroom crepe. It tasted like mushroom and crepe, but there wasn't much else going on. Some onion, salt, cheese, and a light sauce would have been nice.  He got the boeuf bourguignon. It was good, but I could have easily made it at home. If I'm going to pay around $20 for a restaurant dish, then I want to be impressed.   I'm tempted to give this place 2 stars, but I have a feeling that their french toast and more rich entrees are decent. Maybe I will return to try them out--maybe."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Service was exceptional, true French cuisine.  Definitely get the berry tiramisu if they have it in their specials. Crepes are amazing."}
{"text":"Had brunch there recently and I was super impressed. The Onion soup was almost like a stew, rich and full of garlic and seasoning.  Possibly the best I have had in Madison.  I had the potato and bacon crepe and it was fabulous, perfectly cooked potatoes and a bechamel sauce that was incredibly rich and satisfying without being overwhelming or gross.  I'm a little lactose intolerant but a really well prepared sauce is not a problem, and in this case it was perfect.  I can't wait to have it again.  My ladies Croque was also quite a pleasure.  All in all an excellent addition to one of the best neighborhoods in the city for great food.  I can't wait to go back, but I suppose I should hit the gym a bit first."}
{"text":"I felt like I was in Paris! I had really superb \"pistou\" soup and French crepes. A fun touch: Nanou brought out the dishes herself in this intimate little east side restaurant (in shared space with the also excellent Bon Appetit)."}
{"text":"If you were to dine here you'd be so lucky to have Amy as your server. Quite possibly the best waitress I've had. She is friendly, approachable, knowledgeable, and has the \"speedy but not too speedy\" ratio down solid. Everything here is in a perfect medium. Comfortable, relaxing, romantic, and authentic. All that Nanou strived to bring with her from France.   The food is fresh and prepared delicately. Portions are fit to price. Everything on the menu, no matter if you've had it before, leaves you with a sense of nostalgia.   I'd make sure to set up a reservation, especially if you have a large party, as seating is very limited and diners tend to linger and enjoy themselves here."}
{"text":"Paris!! and right on Willy Street too! I went there for lunch and was extremely happy to find another place in Mad town where the people CARE about food.  Treated myself to the hard cider -served in a petite carafe alongside a cute hand-thrown pottery mug/glass. a good start. Had the buckwheat crepe \"Parisienne\"- which was filled w/ ham, mushrooms, gruyere and bechamel sauce. It was PERFECT and came with a side salad of baby greens.  This is a tiny place - only 8 tables- it is now open for some dinners - and DOES take credit cards.  My only tiny negative comment is that they need to upgrade their silverware. They have the cheapest tinniest stuff and it actually detracted from the eating experience. Given the excellent food, the cute plates and handmade mug - the silverware did not fit. they would do fine to go get some funky mismatched heavier silver/stainless at St Vinnys.  I will definitely go back to try more crepes and desserts. They apparently have an in-house pastry chef and I want to try everything! Confession: I have a weak spot for creme brulee. We will go back for dinner also, as they said they always have specials and will have Cassoulet and lamb this winter.  It is not the cheapest cafe - but think of how much you save by not taking that plane trip to Paris!"}
{"text":"Very good crepes, slow service, pleasant lunch.  We tried two crepes. The smoked salmon was delicious and had a nice serving of salmon in a dill/yogurt sauce that was filling and delicious. The mushroom and béchamel crepe could have used a little more gruyere or perhaps another component. It tasted great but wasn't enough to act as a meal. Both were served on a (unique to Madison eating) buckwheat-flour crepe that was terrific. The crepe was hearty, substantive, and tasty, and I'd return again just because of the crepe itself.  Side salads impressed mainly because of the dressing: a high-caliber olive oil that left nice peppery aftertaste on the tongue (only the high octane ones are that complex) mixed with aioli. I had never considered such a combination but it was brilliant and every leaf and tomato shined because of it.  With iced tea our bill came out to just over $30 for two, which is pretty pricey. If you're looking to be full for affordable prices Plaka is a better choice down the street, but for a light lunch in a quaint cafe this is your place. It took over an hour to eat lunch, btw, so note that this is more of a place to linger than grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I wish I had realized Chez Nanou opened while I still lived in Madison! The cafe is small and comfortable.  Provencal decorations make it homey and reminiscent of an actual cafe in Southern France. We enjoyed two of the savory crepes both of which were delicious. I had the lavender creme brûlée, which is what made me want to go there from looking at the menu online. It was perfect!  Nanou and our server were both friendly and encouraging of my feeble attempts at speaking French. The whole experience made me nostalgic for my junior year abroad in Aix-en-Provence. I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful lunch here.  I had the crepe with brie and prosciutto.  It was excellent.  I also had the Kir cocktail, which was great.  It's a cute, romantic cafe."}
{"text":"What a darling little bistro.  We were meeting friends there to celebrate their recent engagement. They live in the neighborhood and were always anxious to try it, but of course it was the out-of-towner (me, who spied it while driving by), who recommended it.   This place is small, with only about eight tables, but it's the perfect place for a leisurely brunch or lunch, or even a romantic dinner.  The décor is simple, but charming, with pictures of Provence decorating the walls and French books stacked neatly in the corners.  I started with the French hot chocolate, which came with an adorable homemade marshmallow ghost (see photo), and a small dish of whipped cream. It was so thick and rich and creamy that it was more like a dessert than a beverage. We all shared a plate of sliced baguette with delicious jams and butter on the side.  I can't not order a croquet madame whenever I see it on a menu, so of course that's what I had. The salty ham, nutty gruyere, creamy bechamel, and soft (but not too runny) egg made it a flawless version. It had some lovely salad-y thing on the side. The others had pain perdu (french toast) and scrambled eggs with smoked salmon. Everything was excellent, and well-prepared.  Service was very pleasant. We appreciated that we were not rushed at all while we were. I always feel guilty staying too long at a table when the restaurant is busy, but there was never a wait for a table so it wasn't a problem at all. The food was made to order, so it took a bit of time, but clearly there is not a lot of staff working, so have patience, because it's worth it.  The lunch and dinner menu looked equally appealing and they offer beer and wine to enjoy with your food. Prices are more than reasonable for the quality you're receiving.  I can't wait to go back again next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"After living in Madison for 4 years, I finally discovered Willy St my senior year and I wish I knew about it earlier. I looked up restaurants on Willy St and found Chez Nanou, which I immediately jumped on because I love French restaurants ever since I traveled to France.  This restaurant is adorable!! Our waitress spoke French very fluently (she was clearly from there), and the ambiance was so cute with checkered table clothes, flowers, and an adorable little chalkboard with the daily specials.  We tried the special appetizer, the Tuna Cocktail, which was excellent. My mom had the Norvegienne crepe and I had the Campagnarde crepe. Both were sooooooooo good and made with buckwheat which is great because I am gluten-free.   I will definitely be returning to this restaurant!! This is a must-go restaurant in Madison!"}
{"text":"\"Quand il me prend dans ses bras Il me parle tout bas Je vois la vie en rose...\" - Edith Piaf, \"La vie en rose\"  After a long week of all work and no play, I really needed a break. I lazily browse around for somewhere that could take my mind off the dreariness of modern life, and I saw this quaint place. Chez Nanou is a delightful bistro that captures the ordinary French aesthetic. The owner is from France, and she wanted to bring the French culinary experience to America.  The food here is delicious. It's French without the pretensions. This is the sort of food you might be served at a bed-and-breakfast in Aix-en-Provence after a long day touring the wine country on a Vespa with your summertime lover. Hearty, good portion size, all-natural and organic, and without the pomp and pretension of haute cuisine. I got the Provençal scrambled eggs with bacon, browned potatoes and a side salad. There's nothing to remark about the bacon and salad, but the eggs and potatoes were quite good. The eggs had Gruyère and herbes des Provençe mixed in, creating a abundantly pungent and savory egg concoction. Personally I am an enormous fan of the food of Southern France precisely because of the earthy fragrance that compose herbes des Provençe - rosemary, thyme, sage, lavender. Like the charmingly rustic countryside of Southern France itself, the food speaks to the ways most people, at the end of the day, look forward to a wholesome, home-cooked meal. For me that day, I was looking forward to peace and quiet away from the bustle of modern life. Here you can get that. Step away from the noise. Take a seat at the checkerboard tablecloth, get a cup of coffee, and escape, even if only in your head, to a better place for a while."}
{"text":"On a cold and blustery Friday night, Chez Nanou served as a warm respite for my girlfriend and I.  Small and charming (probably only about 6 tables), the restaurant focuses on French comfort food.  The menu is small with focusing on crepes, salads, and cassolettes (with a smattering of specials/appetizer/sandwich options).  Suckers for french onion soup, we both opted for the soup and decided to share a savoyarde cassollette.  I found the soup to be better than average.  The rich beef and onion broth could have used a bit more cheese melted on top for it to become a favorite in my book.The savoyarde was exactly as advertised.  Bacon, potatoes and onion all in a bechamel sauce with melted Gruyere cheese.  Rich and decadent, I can only imagine the calories that were buried into the casserole but it was worth it.  As rich as it was, I thought the portion size was perfect to share between two people. We ended the night with a dessert crepe with banana flambe and rum.  While solid, I think it could have used more rum and more butter to really transform it.  I would definitely come back.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful and you can taste the care that goes into preparing and creating the food.  My only recommendation is to put a few simple proteins on the menu to offset the rich and heavy (albeit yummy) dishes that are currently on it."}
{"text":"+5 for their food, especially the Hot Chocolate! +4 for the service +3 for the wait  Amazing, amazing food! I came here for brunch with a friend because my friend (from France) told me that the hot chocolate here was comparable to the hot chocolate she drinks in Paris. And I was not disappointed. The hot chocolate was so delicious and sweet; the chocolate is freshly ground and mixed with cream and other amazing flavors. Definitely come here for the hot chocolate if not for the food.  I had the goat cheese omelette with bacon. The omelette was soft and savory. The goat cheese, spinach, and bacon paired perfectly. Though the hot chocolate and omelette were not the best combination to eat together, I would repeat this experience any time. I cannot wait to try the other entrees.  Service was ok. We arrived when the restaurant was empty, so service was attentive and quick in the beginning. When a few more tables came in, service was almost nonexistent. Unfortunately, it took my friend almost 20 minutes to receive her hot chocolate, and it took almost 35 for our food. Overall, a lot of waiting for drinks and food. If you're looking to have a quick brunch, I wouldn't look here first. I also find that reserving a table over the phone very difficult: Oftentimes, the phone isn't picked up. I have tried to come back here since my first time, and my calls have gone ignored. So perhaps try to reserve tables in person or online if that is an option.  Overall: great food, most incredible hot chocolate I've had in my life, average service, and poor phone reception."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Went for Father's Day brunch tried both crepes, scrambler and gratin. This place has absolutely the best scrambled eggs in Madison, no other restaurant comes close; it's like eating a French egg cloud. We also tried their creme brûlée and lime chocolate cake, both fantastic. The place and service will make you feel like you are in your French grandma's kitchen. Nanou is very warm and friendly, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Croque Madame (same as a croque monsieur but with a sunny side up egg on top) and the hot chocolate.  Their hot chocolate is the closest thing I've had to the hot chocolate at Angelina in Paris. It's incredibly rich and chocolaty. It's a meal in and of itself! but go ahead and order the croque madame too!  Their buckwheat crepes are also very good, but are a little pricey for what you get.  Really nice staff and the chef is a very sweet lady! Also, the place is very adorable with a France themed decor."}
{"text":"Just dined here for the second time. This place is so charming and personable! The waitress recognized our names from having had reservations earlier this week for Valentine's dinner. Unfortunately, we had to cancel because I got food poisoning... but she was so sweet and recommended some great items.  We were a little baffled by what was on the wine list, so the waitress let us sample the wines to see which ones we would prefer.  My boyfriend ordered one of the delicious savory crepes with prosciutto and I ordered a ham and mushroom cassollette which was amazing! I thought it would be pretty heavy, but it wasn't at all. I even ordered a basket of bread to soak up all of the sauce.  I will definitely come back here. Highly recommended for those who want a nice quaint, homey, atmosphere."}
{"text":"This one's going to be long and divided into two parts:  PART I: How I'd rate this restaurant based on my first three or four visits: 4 stars  + The atmosphere is truly pleasant and welcoming. It's intimate and cozy, nice and dark, and very relaxed.  + The service is superb. If I'm not mistaken, Monique has been our waitress every time we've been there, and I can't say enough good things about her.   + The food is generally delicious; their salad dressing is out of this world; French Onion soup is earthy, sweet, and served sizzlingly hot.  - The menu is very limited. There are a few appetizers, some crepes, a chicken dish, and three gratinee dishes.   - They are always out of at least one special. Every single time we've been there, this has been the case. Even more annoyingly, they refuse to erase that special from the blackboard. Why must I know that I could have had boeuf bourguignon  if I'd shown up an hour ago if there's no  boeuf bourguignon to be had? Just get an eraser.  -Prices are  high. The dish I usually get (tartiflette gratinee) is primarily composed of potatoes. It tastes great, but $16 seems a little high.   - I often wonder how much of the food's appeal comes from what must be a massive amount of butter, cheese, and cream.  - Their loyalty program sucks. Eight visits gets you a free dessert. That comes out to $1 a visit for a place where you'll pay $100+ for a dinner for two with a bottle of wine.  -----------------------------------------------------  PART II: Tonight's experience: 1 star  Tonight was an absolute shit show. We made a reservation for eight. Our son turns six months tomorrow, and his grandparents are in town. This was literally the second time we've able to go out in those six months. We wanted something nice and romantic.  We were seated at a table that should not have existed. It was shoved into the back of the restaurant under a bright light, right across from the kitchen and the bathroom, and inches away from a refrigerator. Every minute and a half or so, one of the waitresses had to get something out of this fridge, and when it opened the light became even brighter. We were right in the middle of the area where the staff congregated, and they kept hitting my wife's chair, which was completely unavoidable. Again, this table should not have existed.  So we asked Monique if there was anything to do. As usual, she was fantastic. She apologized and told us that she could move us to another table as soon as they paid their check. By the time we got to that table, though, it was already 8:20.   We ordered wine based on Monique's recommendation (neither of us knows a damn thing about wine) and it was fantastic. French onion soup was uncharacteristically bland tonight; entrees were just what we expected from previous experiences.  Then we ordered dessert. Again, half of the menu was unavailable, but staring at us from the blackboard. But that wasn't a huge problem: they still had their sea salt caramel cheesecake. We ordered a slice to split.  It was awful. Just absolutely awful. In the fourteen years we've been together, my wife and I have never ordered cheesecake and not finished it. There's a first time for everything. The problem was pretty clear: It was overcooked. The edges were way too brown and the cake had sunken into the crust. When we cut into it, it was dry and mealy. If Nanou had tasted a slice, she wouldn't have served it. Or at least she shouldn't have.  So Nanou comes by making her rounds and asks how everything was. We told her that the meal was fine, but that the cheesecake was not good. She came up with a few excuses, but she apologized. Ok. No huge deal. Then the check comes. And the cheesecake is on it. I catch Monique's eye and tell her that I think they should take it off the bill. She goes and tells Nanou that. Nanou responds by glaring at me and making this incredibly dismissive gesture with her hand, flicking her wrist in disgust. Apparently this meant that she would take it off the bill, but it was about the most obnoxious thing I've seen in quite a while. If Nanou wants to complain about customers, she can do that in the kitchen. And that table should not exist."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch with friends. Everything was delicious (especially the French Hot Chocolate with a hint of orange blossom). Portions are just perfect and everything has that great homemade quality.   Service was a bit slow but it was a quiet, snowy day so I wasn't too put off. My only wish is that there was a bit more variety on the menu during brunch. Other than that, I'll be back frequently."}
{"text":"Charming, tasty, whimsical...recommend to try anything but especially the lavender creme brûlée. We had two excellent experiences and would visit often if we lived in Madison."}
{"text":"We ended up here unexpectedly when there was a 2 hour wait for brunch at El Dorado... what a pleasant surprise. The place was pretty packed, so we had to sit three to a table for 2 and interfered with traffic. Other than that, I thought the place was great. We all really enjoyed our entrees. The coffee was excellent. The two individuals that I was with really enjoyed their champagne cocktails. The food seemed like good quality. The salad greens were really fresh and I could tell the gruyere cheese was high quality. The portions weren't huge, but I was happy that I didn't feel stuffed all day. I will be headed back soon! I was really surprised at how many French speaking customers were there too."}
{"text":"Adorable brunch spot with no wait!  The checkered table cloths and flower vases on each table make it very cheery. Our waitress' big smile and French accent added to the experience as well.  I loved that my crepe had prosciutto and Brie. The crepe itself could've been a little more flavorful; perhaps a grainy mustard would've tied the dish together. My friend's smoked salmon scrambled eggs tasted great and I enjoyed my latte. The menu had a lot of other tempting options so I would like to return and try a sweet crepe, other desserts and the Croque Madame.   I hate waiting in line for brunch so depending on how the rest of the menu tastes, I may become a regular!"}
{"text":"If you ever want to escape to France for a few hours for brunch, try this place.  Everyone's nice and friendly, not to mention willing to give you some free French lessons.   Place is quaint and cozy. Food is delicious. Croque Monsieur was absolutely unforgettable. The Morroccon Tea was so good. The French toast is probably the best you will get here in Madison.   Didn't get to try the Nutella crepe, but I'm pretty sure it would've been unforgettable as well."}
{"text":"We were looking for restaurants serving crepes & this one came up. So we gave it a try. Great atmosphere & decor. Service was good. I got the ham omelette & my friend got the mushroom crepe. Both dishes were excellent with great flavor. Lots to eat & I couldn't finish everything on my plate. Parking is limited in the lot next to building so basically street parking. One odd thing was the water had no ice & when I got the coke I ordered no ice either. I didn't ask but thinking maybe they don't gave ice?  I would definitely try this place again. And it does take reservations. Recommended."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food."}
{"text":"This place USED to be so great, what happened?? The last 3 times we went there we were very unimpressed and have pretty much given up. Each time the service was very slow, the help acts like they are overwhelmed and don't know what to do. But worse of all, the food has become ordinary! Something has definitely changed there and not for the better."}
{"text":"Charming little place for a simple French lunch on the near East side, sharing space with Bon Appetit Cafe.  Small menu, but what I ate -- buckwheat crepes (a speciality of Brittany), filled with potato, big chunks of bacon, and gruyere -- was a real pleasure.  Open for lunch only, except for a special French dinner the third Thursday night of each month."}
