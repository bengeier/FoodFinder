{"text":"What can  I say Mr Al got me and the hubby right! He's a hell of a guy..presentation is Everything! He took it there..above and beyond. We were not rushed, every item on the menu was explained thoroughly as we are first timers.  The food oh my damn..would you believe me if I told you it's wayyy better than Chipotle!!!??? Go check it out for yourselves"}
{"text":"As soon as I saw this place come up on yelp I knew I had to try it. I got the bowl with rotisserie chicken and it was bomb! My boyfriend got the steak burrito. The steak was such great quality with awesome taste! The fried cheese was probably both of our favorite part, so yummy! Chris the owner helped us with everything. He was awesome and super helpful! This place is a must try :))"}
{"text":"I started with a rotisserie chicken taco plate with refried black beans (that were incredible) and amazing rice. At the suggestion of the helpful staff I tried the Tractor ORGANIC soda and instantly fell in love with the cherry cream soda. Being ravenously hungry, I went back for seconds and got a steak taco and added rice, cheese, Pico de Gallo and topped it with an over easy egg topped with Green Ajo sauce. This was THE BEST TACO I'VE EVER HAD. I've been all over the southwest US, Spain, Europe, Japan and Korea. This was the best! I'll be back again soon and I'm telling everyone I know to hit this place up. Just amazing grub!"}
{"text":"Another favorite in the Art District! Menu is easy and varied, staff is super nice! Had my bowl prepared by Chris, the owner, this morning. Get the over easy egg and melted cheese added to your order! It just makes it so much better! I chose to order a bowl with rotisserie chicken, crispy fried rice, refried pinto, potatoes, roasted corn, diced tomatoes, black olives, topped with melted cheese and the over easy egg sliced avocado! Delicious! Beverage choice is also great: choice of your usual and organic crafted tractor soda, beers, sangria, Margaritas or ice tea! Will be back soon! Thank you for choosing the Art District as your Home!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here. I am a lover of Mexican food and discovered this place on yelp. I brought my family and friends here and Everyone loved the taste of all the food! It was fast and friendly! Just what I needed with two children. The food was authentic and delicious! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem. We stumbled upon this by accident and I'm so glad we did. The food was amazing! You can choose between a burrito, taco, or tostada and then you go down the \"assembly line\" of toppings. I had the pulled pork tacos which were melt-in-your mouth delicious. They also have Vegan options. The fountain drinks included Coca Cola products and organic soda products. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tacos Huevos has the best breakfast burrito.  I tried the sausage and my husband had the pork. We both absolutely loved our meals!  The owner was great and the staff extremely helpful. You really have to try the sausage burrito!! Soooo good!!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here because it was so good! We plan to come back when we visit Vegas again. They are very caring and make the burritos so BIG! The burritos are one of the best burritos I have ever tried! I suggest people visiting Las Vegas should come check this place out before going back home! My sisters and I did and we are going back home with a happy tummy!  People who live in Vegas and have never been here I suggest you come! They are so attentive with what you need. Fresh food, good food, and fast service!   You'll leave with a smile on your face!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, perfectly cooked tortillas, slow-cooked meat, great salsa, fast service! A side of really good refried beans & rice. Only problem was not enough tacos in the meal. I coulda ate 5."}
{"text":"We were looking for some breakfast burritos and luckily we found this place. Amazing burritos! They're huge and have great flavor. The guy works there was really nice. We had to wait a few minutes for steak to cook but it was well worth the wait. You get to choose any ingredients for your burrito. My wife and I shared a huge burrito and we were stuffed afterwards for less than $9! They're open late too so good for late night, breakfast, or lunch. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best burrito !! I had the steak burrito and it is well priced!we will be back for sure. The staff was also helpful and gave great service. Definitely, recommending to friends."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place by accident & we absolutely loved this place !!! Juan \"el chino\" was so friendly and he prepared our food and it was delicious! We ordered the breakfast plate with steak and our friends had the flat steak tacos. Yum! Definitely a MUST when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos I've had in a long long time. The meat was so fresh and the grilled cheese on top was a awesome!  The price was right and the service was fast.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome addition for downtown!  Great ingredients, homemade tortillas are awesome!  Pulled pork was zesty and full of flavor!  Quality breakfast and lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous! We had a large group, and had plenty of seating. We tried a little of everything burritos, bowls and quesadillas, all were delicious!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Burrito with an egg.  The food is fresh, salsa was spicy, big portion.   The egg with pork was a great combination   The only bummer, they were not able to sell beer because the owner was not on site.     Keep up the great customer service and quality food."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent prices and a top notch staff. This place maybe my new go to food spot."}
{"text":"Excellent care to customer satisfaction. Great late night spot for vegan options. Recommended."}
{"text":"Love trying new places and Tacos Huevos was the bomb!!! I will definitely become a regular!"}
{"text":"New concept Fresh Food Healthy presentation! Very clean !!! Great service ! Deco is modern and minimalist ...great breakfast option"}
{"text":"They have a lot of variety of food here vegan vegetarian as well as with me chicken beef Carnitas prices are reasonable sauces are good the meats very tender cook right and get black beans or refried beans rice prices are reasonable nice atmosphere ordering is a little out of sorts because they're new and just opened but a great restaurant to visit we would do this again definitely"}
{"text":"OMG is really all that needs to be said. They put fried cheese on my burrito! The owner and staff are very nice and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Im from California and have searched far and wide for a good breakfast burrito and this is definitely the best. I got the sausage breakfast burrito with potatoes and sunny side up egg and the famous green sauce. Great size as my brother and I were only able to eat 2/3 of the burrito and saved the rest for later. I ate he remaining 1/3 the next day and it was still delicious because more of the flavor soaked in. My brother ate his remaining 1/3 2 days later and he said it was still flavorful. Good job guys as this spot now has my favorite breakfast burrito!  I will be trying the burrito bowl next time as well!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem on Yelp and I was not disappointed at all!! Tyler the assistant manger was sooo friendly and attentive, recommended a breakfast that I immediately told my husband it would be something I would make at home!! Loved the quick and friendly service, the place was clean and organized, the Peruvian salsa is to die for and excited to try the tracker soda!! This California picky latina will be back!!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. I'm salivating just having flashbacks about this place.  It was my first time in Vegas. AWESOME SAUCE! As we roamed the city, there came a point where we needed food. Turns out you can't just live and thrive off booze. One night I was just going to be content with going through a drive thru at Burger King but my friend insisted on no.   Him - \"why would we eat the same ol stuff we can get at home? What's the point of that?!\" Me - \"I just wanted to coat my stomach some more.\" Him - jumps on Yelp  Best decision EVER! This place has hands down some of THE BEST tacos I've ever had! The chef and the other gentleman who I assume was the owner were both super friendly. There were so many options to pick from as far as what to put on your taco - tons of salsas, veggies, egg or fried cheese. All the ingredients are fresh and cooked right in front of you.   I had a chicken taco with onion, cilantro, an egg, guacamole and fried cheese. Amazing! And even though we were the last customers of the night, they didn't try to rush us and made sure to check on us. I so wish they were closer to Chicago!"}
{"text":"Very well done food and awesome owner. Affordable as well! Easy parking, nice location, and great inside decoration."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas for the Run Rock N Roll races and couldn't shake the desire for breakfast tacos.  Husband and I literally eat tacos every week in San Francisco.  We've had them in Mexico on food tours, all over California and other parts of the US.  I wouldn't call myself a taco expert but feel like I have a good point of comparison.    This place literally put the most love into my slow roasted pork tacos.  They scrambled eggs to add, grilled cheese on a plancha to add (OMG!) and had beautiful home made salsas.  The owner(?) took his time explaining and talking with us about them and they were a work of art.  I would venture to say that these were the best tacos I've ever had.  Maybe I had more authentic tacos in Mexico, but I'd have these over those any day."}
{"text":"Great food! Child friendly restaurant with a fun atmosphere and great food! We had the quesadillas and burrito bowls. Their cilantro dressing we great.  The service was slow. It they were busy and took their time making each dish for their customers.  We will define be back to try more on the menu- my wife is looking to try the breakfast options!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! You won't be disappointed . Hard shell tacos and sunny side up eggs"}
{"text":"First-time here tried the tacos, and very impressed with the steak It was moist and flavorful tasty. Will definitely be here again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"If Chipotle had a soul, it would be Tacos Huevos. Great, fresh, plentiful food. If free will was real, I would strongly urge you to try this place."}
{"text":"Massive burrito with great flavors and fresh and healthy bowls. Super cool Arts District neighborhood with lots of other cool shops and bars. Local favorite and a must for anyone visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Bonus!!  Friendly staff and cool, clean interior. They have VEGGIE steak and chicken street tacos!  Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I'm from out of town and I found this place because of reviews online. They were so helpful. They had lots of vegetarian options. My boyfriend had the vegetarian beef and it was very delicious."}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas for breakfast burritos....hands down!!! It's like a Mexican chipotle and you pick what you want. Amazing concept, delicious food, great customer service, and reasonable prices!!! You MUST come here next time your in town!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place with great food. We ordered chicken, pork and beef tacos, they were delicious and also beautiful. Chicken Burrito was also excellent, flavorful and moist. Love the decor & atmosphere as well. Highly recommended spot!"}
{"text":"I had the nachos with chicken and really enjoyed them. The portions a quite large and can definitely be shared; they also offer a decent array of fresh toppings that come included. The food isn't what I would call authentic Mexican food but I don't think that it's supposed to be and therefore I believed that they nailed it. I would come here again when I find myself in this part of town. The one complaint that I would have is with the bar next door. They share the building and a door so the sound travels very easily and is pretty disrupting."}
{"text":"This place is out of this world. If you are here, make sure you get a steak burrito. I have never had asada like the one I have had here. Juan, an incredible employee here, said they marinate the steak for hours and it is so juicy and tender.   Juan is a great employee and displays a passion for this place of work and wants to make sure that you come away with a positive experience. If you are here in Vegas, make sure you visit this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place was good, the ingredients were fresh. We went at dinner and got burritos and bowls. The tractor sodas are good and different. My only two things; its a B score from the health department, and the rice I had was so dry and hard it hurt my teeth. At least it was on the bottom of my bowl so I could eat around it. Tacos Huevos was OK but there's also other similar places like Chipotle and Qdoba."}
{"text":"Like a subway for burritos. 100 times better than chipotle. Chipotle doesnt have that many options. This place has so many things you can add to your burrito and the burrito is huge. One of the best burritos I have ever tasted. It is a little pricey but its worth it once you see how big the burrito is and when you taste it.The customer service is also great. You should check this place out at least once but im sure you will be back.They have indoor and outdoor seating which is cool."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first time and it was amazing ! They walked us through the whole menu and showed us everything they have . We got smoked pork burritos with an egg and we added all our favorites inside and it was so amazing. I think it might've been one of the Best burritos I've had. Also they have a house sauce that is to die for . It's like a cilantro type sauce it is so good !"}
{"text":"So yummy!! The green taco sauce is to die for and the breakfast plates are the perfect hangover cure. Hit this place up for lunch before be Life is Beautiful festival and it really fueled us up for the day. Highly recommend it, great food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Tacos huevos just recently opened but I recommend you stop in! We tried it for lunch and had a rotisserie chicken bowl with over easy egg on top and 2 street tacos and both were great. Service was friendly. Tacos are handmade! Fresh ingredients. Good price point. It is in a building connected to the Urban Lounge bar which looks like it has a cool ambience as well as an art gallery in the back. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This is Mexican food cooked the way you would cook it yourself at home (if you were a really good cook and had the time to make it right). Every ingredient is quality and fresh. The flavor of the pork carnitas is perfect. The melted cheese and friied egg on top were \"just so.\" The prices are way reasonable for what you get ($17 including tax for too much food for two people). Bonus: parking is both abundant and free!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The food is absolutely delicious and authentic! Executive Chef Fernando was great and very kind in helping me prepare my \"build your own\" taco plate. The ingredients were super fresh and yummy, and the corn tortillas are homemade. This is a great place for breakfast/lunch tacos. I am a vegetarian and had no issues finding food to eat! My boyfriend and friends loved the chicken and steak tacos with beer.   The ambience is very relaxing and chill. Located in the arts district, the restaurant had indoor and outdoor seating. The patio was large with multiple tables with umbrellas. Looks like a cool place that offers events as well.   If you like fresh, authentic tacos, you should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"If you are in the art distract and want some amazing food for a great price come this place. Eating dinner here right now walked in got an amazing burrito with no wait. Definitely coming her with the family again."}
{"text":"Omg this place is wonderful!  Just had a breakfast bowl...roasted chicken, egg, potatoes, DELICIOUS! The manager and staff were so helpful and walked us through everything we needed to know to make our selection. Kind of sad that we don't have them in Los Angeles LOL but will definitely be back the next time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Called in after a night out downtown. Ordered a chicken burrito and added a couple things to it. Honeslty the best burrito I've ever eaten. Would highly recommend. Great helpful staff and great prices :-) thanks guys"}
{"text":"I'm a quasi-fan. Love me some tacos, burritos, bowls, and really all the things. Flavors here generally on point, ingredients are consistently fresh, and serving size is--again for the most part--generous. Nice fresh melted cheese, crispy tortillas heated on the grill, and organic soda options. Yeehaw!    Still, Tacos Huevos has some improvements to make if it wants to transcend beyond this perfectly average vote of mediocrity. Its shortcomings are also consistent, from the first time I went shortly after they opened, to today, some months since that first experience. They include these two pressing points:  -- Confused waitstaff, and inhospitable priorities. Today there were something like 4-6 people in for lunch, my group included. Somewhere between their order and mine and the folks behind me, a called-in order was placed. All staff began processing this order while those of us who were physically present, in the restaurant, stood there watching this dance with no one acknowledging us, let alone taking our orders. And no one seems to have a fixed position; it's just a free-for-all with staff jumping from grill to line to register and back again. No wonder they're confused about whose orders were taken, and not. Looking at previous reviews, this has been a problem since at least October of last year. May be time to rethink things, have a staff meeting? 5-10 minutes passed before the owner glanced up and inquired. Meanwhile, my friends were halfway through their meal. Things were not so busy that your present customers should be ignored for this long, and not after months of time to iron out kinks in the system.   -- Pricing. On the average, especially with the typical serving size, prices are fair. There are a few shock points, though, so beware. Mine came after ordering a chicken quesadilla, a bargain at $5.75, but was rung up at nearly $9. Why? The added tiny-tup of guacamole, maybe 1.5-tablespoons worth, was $1.95. Outrageous.  Forget gold bullion, put your money in guacamole.   A friend wanted iced tea, but they had run out. No effort was made to fix this. Maybe later? It's iced tea. And there's no one here. Come on.   So yeah, decent food, but the weird pricings and constantly confused staff always leave me wanting. Wanting better. And by better, I mean average customer service. For less."}
{"text":"I can't wait for this place to work out the kinks.  Came here for breakfast because I was looking for something new to try comma was pleased to find that it was in the space where the old downtown Crown & Anchor was(which honestly didn't fit the vibe of the arts district).   I love that they are a farm-to-table taco place that serves everything with a choice of an egg. It was a tiny bit hard to order but I'm sure they will work out the menu and ordering issues and have a full staff as we were there very early in the morning. I got two different tacos, chicken and pork,  a side of fried rice and beans, with an egg on top. Taco's were amazing,  and they make their own tortillas! the egg was cooked perfectly. And I mean perfectly . That's super important.  The star Of the meal was the house sauce.  A creamy green sauce.  Good on everything!! They have awesome sodas organic sodas and Stellar ambience. I highly recommend and I really hope this place sticks around"}
{"text":"This review is long over due. I visited Tacos Huevos in July while I am in town for a Fitness Business owners conference at the convention center. We just happened upon this incredibly inviting little restaurant. We were greeted by the owner. He gave us the history of his restaurant and made me one awesome taco salad. They were doing an art event in front of their space that night and it drew an eclectic yet inviting crowd. It was awesome be in such an inclusive vibe. The food had great flavor and was awesome quality. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"The pork and chicken tacos were good along with the HOT sauce. BUT the steak was a little dry and needed more seasoning. I was in Vegas for a business trip and decided to eat at Tacos Huevos since Yelp listed them as s 5 star. I rated them a 3 star."}
{"text":"This place is hidden right between a couple clubs so it can be a little hard to find if you're not paying close attention. However, if you find it then you've found what might be the best burritos in Vegas (and that's hard to do). I'm not a big egg guy so I didn't add some of their namesake to the dish, but I did get a big slab of melted and slightly browned cheese, which was incredible to say the least. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful with this initially somewhat confusing setup, but it's worth every second and every penny. The prices were actually pretty good, especially considering how much you get there, and the restaurant was very clean. The decor is a little eclectic, pulling some of it's style from the clubs around it. This was probably the hardest thing to leave behind in Vegas; to me and my food passion it was just as memorable as The Strip."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Texas, one of the things I miss most is breakfast tacos. But with Tacos Huevos around, I don't need to! Eggs in the name means breakfast is available all day- my pick is the scrambled egg tacos with potatoes and bacon or sausage, but whatever you get, add melted cheese on top and a side of their green ajo sauce (creamy avocado). The tortillas are freshly made for that extra touch of awesome. It's a great way to start my day! Bonus points for having vegan and vegetarian options.  That said, staff are friendly but ordering system is disorganized- it's a cafeteria style made-to-order line but it's unclear who takes the order, makes the order, and rings it up, as staff are constantly moving between roles leading to forgotten items and payment delays."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The owner was present and very friendly and accommodating . The options for vegetarians are more than most restaurants offer. We had the vegetarian burrito. I highly recommend getting an over easy egg inside. They even grilled the shredded cheese before putting it into the burrito and the crispiness that this created along with the grilled golden flavor gave the burrito a very unique flavor. I would highly recommend the organic soda, the cherry creme soda was our favorite. Fresh, flavorful, and filling! Definitely discovered a new favorite place to visit when in Vegas and already craving the burrito!  Extremely kid friendly as well. We were here at closing time and they still treated us like royalty. If there is ever a wait it would be worth it."}
{"text":"I'm in love! Awesome location, super cool staff, foods amazing, excellent prices... A new go-to spot for sure! A must try not only in the Arts District but Vegas all together! #highlyrecommended"}
{"text":"Awesome - cute, cheap, great food. Fresh tacos, burritos, etc. in the Arts Factory building."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Delicious tacos. Ingredients tasted fresh. It has a nice ambiance and the staff are very friendly. The price is average. Will definitely be a weekly spot for me."}
{"text":"Pulled pork burrito for me and flat iron steak bowl for my wife. Solid job on both. Fresh and portions were ample plus. Sincere and quick service. Patio looks nice but we opted for the dining room. Kudos on the decor."}
{"text":"Totally love this place!!! Fresh food, super clean, great service, outdoor patio, bring your dog, easy parking, great prices, what else is there.  Did I mention how fresh the food is??? That is the difference.  Please support this place so Chef Fernando can keep us well fed. Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on our way home from Utah. Food was fresh, atmosphere was inviting, one of the cooks came out from behind the counter to help us with the menu. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Food is good. everything is prepared as you order and right in front of you. friendly staff and prices are cheap for the area."}
{"text":"Tacos Huevos is the place which can make you serve with the excellent taste of Mexican food. They serve the food with the fresh, quality ingredients.   They have the remarkable service in confined with the menus of the lunch and dinner.   Their charming ambiance and calmly composed environment arrangement have always been the candy on the top of the cake. They have the finest services of a bathroom with the complete set of cleanliness.    Go and visit this amazing place right now!"}
{"text":"Amazing food one of the best in town!! Egg on a burrito with melted cheese too! The slow cooked pork was amazing and the choice of extras was amazing! The hot sauce is really hot! The soda on tap is the best in town non GMO \"Coconut soda!!\" The Nutella quesadilla is great too! I look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  The food here is amazing.  The 1st time I ordered a chicken bowl with potatoes, bell pepper, black beans, roasted corn, chopped lettuce, sour cream and cilantro... delicious!  The 2nd (and 3rd) time I ordered the 2 taco plate.  Their black beans are amazing!  My tacos had shredded chicken, lettuce, pico and melted crispy cheese... YES melted CRISPY cheese.  It is so delicious!  The only thing that would make this place better is the line a little faster, but the food is worth the wait.  If you are on a time crunch for lunch, maybe call in the order so it is ready when you get there.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In our trip to Vegas we visited this place  And we are happy with the service  Owner is very nice and the food is delicious. We recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great new place. Ambiance, decor and hospitality are as good and fresh as the food. Definitely try to Nutella dessert, it's unique and delicious. Flat iron steak was my favorite dish."}
{"text":"What a great Yelp find!  We were waited on right away and the man taking our order couldn't have been friendlier!  The tacos are stuffed with meat, so I found two of them plus some chips to be plenty filling. They make fresh tortillas and the melted cheese on top was the perfect addition. I loved the unique soda flavors from Tractor Soda...coconut and blood orange to just name a couple. The prices were also great and it had a unique decor."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I'm from out of town and I am very sad this isn't where I live! I just had a double jaw surgery and I can't eat much and I was able to eat their bowls both days that I was in town it was sooo delicious. The shredded pork is sooo soft. I just loved it! When I come back in November I will be coming back. Customer service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"What a gem! So glad we drove over to this absolutely fantastic place. We all had breakfast burritos. I had the slow cooked pork which was cooked for 14 hours. My sister had the steak burrito. Grilled and well seasoned. The guacamole and pico de gallo are fresh like all the ingredients with big chunks of avocado in the guacamole. The cheese is blended and melted prior to placing it in the burrito. The wrapper is big but thin so you have a huge burrito without a heavy carbohydrate load. I normally eat breakfast bowls so to limit carbs but not necessary here. They have organic soda and regular soda. Yes you can get the regulars of coffee, tea, orange juice and even coconut water. I took loads of photos to show this place is for real! The ambiance is completely fun, eclectic and funky. Yum!"}
{"text":"We were the six group this afternoon. All we get back in Wisconsin is qdoba or chipotle. You guys blew them away. Bigger and better!!!  Love the idea of eggs and melted cheese. Also the puréed black beans rather then whole. Keep on keepin on"}
{"text":"The food was good and tasty. The server was slow , but very accommodating . I asked to warm up my son chicken ( he is on special diet ) and he went all the way to warp it and keep it in the oven . The price really good and they have life music when we were there . Location is good very close to outlet."}
{"text":"The food was good and owner was nice! Definitely will be back. Reasonably priced! But the FRYED CHEESE!! Yes please! On everything.   Wish the organic soda machine was working while we were there but next time!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Love the concept and enjoyed the food. Simple and fresh works for me.   There is something missing. Maybe the smile of the miss that served me.   Also couldnt leave tip as the debit card processing wont accept tips....Boss plz fix,  not everyone carries cash or credit card. I felt un comfortable not leaving the tip."}
{"text":"Good spot for tacos and burritos. Not THE BEST by any means, but very good service and reasonable prices, which pushes it from what is 3.5 star quality food to 4 stars. Worth checking out in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is dope!! Our bowls were amazing. We went right after they opened for the day; the avocado hadn't even been cut yet!! Talk about fresh! Fresh out the box!!! I choose this restaurant because of the vegetarian options and we were not disappointed. We're only in town for the weekend, but will most definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos, burritos, tostadas...with a fried egg and delicious melted cheese on top, yes please!  I've been excited to try this place since they opened and today was finally the day. I got the pork tostada with the fried egg and broiled(melted)cheese and a steak street taco(fresh handmade tortilla!). Both were extremely delicious and full of flavor. It was too much food for me but I didn't have a hard time eating everything on my plate. My husband had the breakfast burrito with the pork and was very happy with the flavors and size of his burrito.   Easy parking in the arts district.   I'm so ecstatic to have fresh and yummy Mexican food that elevates the standard fare.   We're going back tomorrow for lunch...see you there!"}
{"text":"The tacos & quesadilla are really good. The meat is perfect & juicy. Really good service. We got a sample of the pulled pork and it's also really good. Most definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We came across tacos huevos on our outing the the children's museum. We walked in and it was a casual place. The manager Tyler was very friendly and helpful, we had a great conversation. Tacos were excellent! The tortillas were thick and not an overwhelming taste. The meat was nice and smoked, juicy with great taste! My only dilemma is that I couldn't find a bathroom. Overall amazing place!"}
{"text":"This is within walking distance of downtown and is a hidden gem. We ordered three different things for breakfast including the breakfast plate, tacos, and a burrito and loved it all. The portions are generous and the salsas are fantastic. Will definitely come again and try lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Made my own sample platter of tacos, all of them were delicious. Definitely a must stop."}
{"text":"I know it was late but u should never risk getting a phone call for the food service.  The cashier was cold and annoyed. This was 5 other friends and myself first time coming here.  They leave knives on the container. The dont change their gloves when they handle money.  I can not believe they are still opened."}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients with bright flavors. No dead food here!  Meat and vegan options. Wife tried pork, steak and chicken street tacos. She loived the steak and pork tacos. Chicken was also very good, but not as good as the other two.   I had vege-chicken street tacos. Good flavors. Loved the fresh-made tortillas, and the green sauce (spicy and bright).   Whole meal was tasty and affordable.     Friendly staff and management.   Fast in and out.  Convenient location. We were able to stop off, get a quick bite and get going pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Great Food and Service. Love the Breakfast Burritos, you can taste the freshness in the food."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Absolutely delicious burritos!!! Must try! I will be returning again and tell all my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"On my way to Super Bowl party T Urban Lounge, Found this AMAZING spot!  Talk about class, and lots of extras.  This is nice spot, and colorful.  This Arts District is lovely..I must say!  This whole building 150 Charleston is the place for culture if you're looking, and fun."}
{"text":"As a tourist I like to try to find the lesser known areas and the \"artsy\" part of town when I visit new places. I visited on the hottest day (ever, actually, it was the all time record high), so there wasn't a lot going on. I decided to try this place since they were one of the few things open. I don't think they were expecting customers or something because they seemed a little frazzled trying to explain to me how ordering works. I had three different people work on my order. At one point one of them stopped to do something else in the middle of making my tacos and never came back, and I just stood there for several minutes until someone else took over. By the time I got my food it wasn't as hot as it probably should have been if the service had been more prompt. That being said, they were some of the most delicious tacos I have ever had. I also liked their unique organic sodas. The coconut one was fantastic. I also appreciated the compostable plates (although I am not sure if they are actually composted). Hopefully by the time I visit Las Vegas again they will have their kinks worked out and I can change this to 5 stars."}
{"text":"One of those best hole-in-the-wall places and best finds. Definitely a keeper for us who were spoiled by awesome Mexican food in Cal. We now live in Hawaii and we're visiting Las Vegas then craving for a good Mexican food minus the expensive price tag. Tasty Mexican food flavor and the burnt chili salsa is a must have!"}
{"text":"This place is one of those hidden treasures. Food was amazing. Customer service was just as good. If you are looking for great food and a chill place to enjoy it this is what you are looking for. We will be back. And every 3rd friday there is an event with live entertainment and fun things happening. Be sure to check it out."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!! The food is super tasty and delicious as so was the service! My new favorite spot in Vegas!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Love this place !! It was unique and delicious The welcoming customer service was on point !!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! You must try! Friendly environment! Great healthy food. Love! Love! Love!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give it a try since it is a 5 stars review restaurant. The food was not bad but nothing about it was over the top or really good. I will only come back if I have no place to eat.   However, the workers were super friendly and helpful with the menu. I ordered the taco plate and breakfast place. It's about $30 up. Make sure to eat ur taco with cheese before it get cold."}
{"text":"Very clean, flavorful food! The staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a rotisserie chicken salad, and steak tacos that were really good. It's especially great because you can build all your own salads, bowls, and tacos. We will be back often:)!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I came here but I can honestly say that was one of the best tasting tacos I've ever had.  Be back soon you can believe it!!!!  My new daily regimen for sure and it's exciting to have something new like this Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place two stars because of the friendly workers that were there   I stopped by here in the morning to check it out and grab some breakfast.....   I was greeted right away and the workers were super friendly I got a breakfast plate to go..... I got steak beans and rice .... they tried to give me scrambled eggs but nicely made me an over easy upon request :) which was very much appreciate   The food isn't cooked fresh to make its in like trays or whatever you call it like chipotle style   Nothing about the food was over the top or really good just regular food it didn't stand out or make me want to come back.....   The workers made me fresh coffee and happily game me sour cream and salsa   I might come back if I really don't have anywhere else to go but probably not there's way better places downtown"}
{"text":"Omg the pork, the pork, you gotta get the pork! Everything here is homemade and the tortillas are as good as they get. It's kinda buffet style n you can get your tacos, burritos, bowl or salad anyway you like with whatever type of ingredients including vegan (and apparently it's good cause one guy was getting four or five boxes to-go for himself and all his friends and I asked why here? He said there is no other place around that offers amazing vegan Mexican food like this place n he loved the vegas cheese). I love the regular cheese n they melt it for you, so it's all toasty n bubbly n slide it onto your order... my son, hubby, mom, friends, coworkers whoever I bring/brought there become addicted, it's so frickin good!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Tacos Huevos on the way to Zion National Park.  As this was our first time here, Chris walked me and my wife through the menu and served as our protein Sherpa.  We followed his suggestions and it did not regret it.  Chris served up some mind-blowing breakfast burritos that fueled us through some serious hikes that afternoon.  Will definitely plan on stopping back in every time we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Went there on Halloween. Only customer in this place. Burrito with melted cheese and fried egg is awesome. Sitting in a cool empty dining room sipping a Bohemia  just adds to it."}
{"text":"Great place!! The egg and the cheese really add to this.. I used this as a great hangover meal.. the food was awesome the owner explained how everything worked once we came in..  great gem worth a try"}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood place serving gourmet quality Mexican food in a clean, hip building with a covered patio area."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Vegan friendly and so delicious! It can be difficult to find good vegan options, but this is phenomenal! The staff is beyond kind and so sweet! New favorite!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tostadas piled high with eggs and cheese. OMG! The service here is prompt & polite. The food is top notch and you can chill on the patio."}
{"text":"We showed up with 9 people at closing and were served very graciously. The food was excellent. Tacos outstanding. The ingredients in the food were all very tasty. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place has earned my 5 star. Was initially a 4 for me because the soy based veggie meat takes a little while to cook (only a few minutes) but the taste is spot on every time  Love this place so much!  If you're a Chipotle Bowl fan, than come over this way.100% tastier and I really like that it's part of the Arts Facotry."}
{"text":"Excellent food Plentiful Portion Friendly service Highly recommend visiting this location!  (Bathrooms were very clean too)"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: incredible food, massive portions, incomparable prices, owner is amazing  When you're on a budget in Vegas, it's hard to find food places with large enough portions while maintaining that budget. Moreover, it's even harder to find food that tastes edible. Tacos Huevos is your gleam of hope off the strip. My $7.75 chicken burrito is enough to fill up the most avid eaters  The food is pretty spectacular for its price. As the name suggests, basic orders of tacos, burritos, bowls and the such come with eggs. This, along with their melted cheese and homemade tortillas made my meal spectacular.   The interior is also a welcome surprise compared to the rather rundown area around the restaurant. Definitely a trendy stop that had care into its design."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path... took our cab driver about an hour to find this place... no joke. But once there, you are rewarded with the most excellent food and service. We tried no less than 3 menu items each and was loving each mouthful. Small place but decorated with a cool, hip vibe. There is a connected bar that is pretty cool as well. Will be back next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. From the service to the food, it's a grand experience. The owner took time to explain the menu and how everything works. Tortillas are hand made, and the food matches the price. Everything was perfect. I loved how they weren't cheap on the meat like a lot of places are. I got steak tacos and there was plenty of steak in my tacos. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Saw this place last week while at Cornish Pasty across the street and decided I needed to try it one day.  Was browsing places to eat today on yelp and it popped up.  After reading the  reviews, I had to try it!  The place was surprisingly empty for lunch time on a weekday in the downtown area.  After speaking with (who I assume) is the owner, he said that they've only been open 6 weeks.   The service was quick and friendly.  The food was DELISH.  I got a pork burrito bowl w/a fried egg and Fried CHEESE (whaaaat?!).  Not something I'd ever think of putting on a burrito bowl but after seeing the pics and tasting it...SO worth it.  Cute lil place, highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best food I had while in Vegas actually.  Fresh guacamole and chips with spicy salsa and chicken tacos.  Everything was delicious.  Great find if you are headed to the National Park and looking for a lunch spot off the strip.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Visiting from Texas and we know our tacos and burritos. The food is amazing and the owner was incredibly friendly and accommodating. I HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Great addition for the Arts District. Really fresh, quality ingredients. Great corn tortillas. Two taco combo is a great deal for a meal. Plus add eggs to most anything. Enjoy it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"This place was pretty amazing. It's location in the Arts District is great and the food was phenomenal. The pork is the best meat option if you are having trouble deciding"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Mexican comfort food restaurant in downtown LV. The food is yummy and the service is fantastic!!  If you haven't been, I highly recommend it.  They are very accommodative for people with special diets too.  Give the organic sodas a shot - I liked all the flavors they carry.  Wish we had one of these stores in Denver."}
{"text":"Walked in was unsure about what to get when the chef said he'd make up something special for me and the wife...special couldn't even begin to explain it!! Beyond words and flavors ...definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Wow massive burrito with everything you could want. They add an egg to all there food and its a nice protein add. I got the smoke pork and my biddy got the steak. Both of us were very pleased with them.  I highly recommend this place and I will bring the wife next time."}
{"text":"We come here for a meal when visiting First Friday in the Arts District. The food is prepared in front of you, and you choose the main design of a quesadilla, street taco, burrito, etc. We really love the freshness of the food. I have eaten the street tacos with all the toppings before, and last night tried them with rotisserie chicken, though you can choose vegetarian options or flatiron steak too. My husband had the burrito with steak. He loves it. The burritos are almost as big as your arm!! They serve beer and soft drinks. Last night the patio was hopping with people, sounds, and soft lights in the trees. It is a great place to stop after walking miles through all the wonderful art, too!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   Outside: Nice family friendly picnic area in the grass that has a great view of the Art District. Some tables are in the shade and some aren't so you can choose. One of the picnic tables has giant JENGA!   Inside: has a really cool vibe and feels artsy. The restaurant is very clean along with the modern restroom- the hand soap even smells pretty! The employees were super patient and friendly making this a great first experience. I even met the owner Chris and he is so amazing! He kindly introduced himself and happily showed me the different sections on the menu with a smile!   Food: I ordered chicken nachos because the person in front of me ordered it & it looked so good! At first I was a bit skeptical because it's hard to find the perfect nacho chips that aren't stiff, but to my surprise I was extremely happy with my meal! The nacho chips were perfect and the ingredients were proportioned so I was able to scoop up goodness with a nacho and finish my whole meal like that. I LOVED that they also have Vegetarian options, as well!"}
{"text":"I have not found a better breakfast burrito out of New Mexico.. until I came here! HOLY SMOKES!! The steak was so tender with no fat!! Bubbling hot melted cheese with a perfectly cooked fried egg HEAVEN!! The pico de gallo wasn't like your normal store bought.. this was fresh ingredients and every bite was refreshing...You must come try the food for yourself. I will be coming back on a frequent basis"}
{"text":"Tacos Huevos is the latest restaurant to occupy this corner of the Arts District. We came here as a huge group (about 12 of us) to have ourselves a spicy, yet casual, brunch experience, and we were not dissapointed.   The weather was still too hot to occupy the patio (hopefully there will be misters by next summer?), so we piled into the dining area adjacent to the ordering station.   If you are looking for an alternative to fast-casual Mexican food chains, and would like to support a local business, then this is your next spot. The atmosphere is casual, but inviting, the owner and staff are awesome, and the food was more than enough to get you through to dinner."}
{"text":"We were welcomed when we walked in the door. The food was absolutely incredible. The homemade tacos are made in front of you with homemade tortillas and the fresh chips and salsa were great. We ordered 4 different meals and all shares because they were all different and delicious.   Extremely impressed!   We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The best tacos in all of Nevada and especially in Las Vegas. If ever you decide to visit the area, be sure to stop in and try some delicious tacos. Say we sent ya!"}
{"text":"I just ate the BEST mexican food Ive had in the 13 years I have lived in Las Vegas! And guess what? I had it LOW CARB! Yep, low carb mexican. They made me an egg taco shell. And that melted cheese pull? Yes! I had the steak which was juicy, tender and full of flavor. I also had the smoked pork which was smokey and soft. Add toppings. Green sauce and red sauce were full of classic cali mexican flavors. The service was also on point. I could eat here every day! They have some really good looking vegan options too. Im just overjoyed they have low carb/keto options!!!"}
{"text":"Tortillas made fresh, excellent mild medium and hot salsas.  Located in Arts District, this place is worth the drive from any part of town"}
{"text":"Usually only come down this way for First Friday, I was pleasantly surprised to find a place opened only for breakfast/brunch hours. After seeing the freshly pressed corn tortillas photo, I knew I needed to make the trip down to check it out. I ordered the breakfast plate with rice, pinto beans, cotija cheese and their medium chile verde sauce. The sauce was so good and flavorful!  The coffee was a really robust Guatemalan roast and I really enjoyed the self serve coffee bar.   The decor was nice inside and I would like to go back again when it's not so hot to sit on the patio. Tyler was very helpful explaining the menu and getting us situated. Only giving 4 stars because the bacon was tough. The rest of the food and service was great. Will definitely come back again to try the tacos next."}
{"text":"We were referred here by my brother. The owner came out and gave us an overview of the menu and provided some recommendations. I went with the burrito with pork, scrambled egg, refried beans, fried cheese, hot and medium salsa. My wife had the taco platter with the over easy egg on the beans and fried cheese on the taco. We shared a large guacamole and chips as well. It was all very delicious. The flavors are bold and well balanced. My biggest complaint is the pricing. The entrees were fair at $8-9 each. The large guacamole was almost $5 for portion just large enough for 2 people to share. I get that avocados are pricey so I guess this is alright but the chips were an additional almost $4 on top of the guacamole. That part hurt. Nevertheless, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.   Tacos were excellent.  I had a chicken and a steak.  My husband had chicken, steak and pork.  Steak and pork was very good.  Chicken was just ok a little bland and I would not get it again.   Green salsa was amazing!  Met the owner and he very nice. We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Not your regular, run of the mill burrito. Very tasty and fresh. All food is made to order and prepared right in front of you. They even offer organic soda. Tacos Huevos is highly recommended and their prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"O M G! This place is SO good!! I got the bowl with chicken and loaded it up with greens and spinach, pico, salsa, guacamole and topped with an over easy egg. This establishment is far superior to any place that is a chain and similar. The chicken is seriously so good! It's legit pulled fresh off the roasted chicken and in large pieces. I will be back many many times. So good!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of chipotle.  Honestly they just opened so if your not patient then don't go yet. But they have great customer service (big deal to me). Glad we got this lil spot downtown."}
{"text":"In search of breakfast close to Fremont, Tacos Huevos came up. Mexican breakfast? Done. Stopped in and was immediately warmly welcomed by I presume the owner.  I was kind of confused by the menu, but I just let him build me a breakfast bowl that involved smoked pork, breakfast potatoes, pico de gallo, green Peruvian hot sauce and a glorious amount of freshly melted cheese.  A runny egg on top to boot! Hallelujah.  Loved.every.bite.  This place is kind of like qdoba but better, plus they have a swanky dining area.  The only suggestion I have is that the menu is hard to understand and I'm not sure why, and it could probably be less confusing.  It was a lot to take in and I stood dumbfounded for a few minutes. The owner's suggestions helped make my decision easier."}
{"text":"Delicious burritos that are bigger than Chipotle, and include more ingredient options. You can add melted cheese or a fried egg to any item! The carnitas are delicious. The organic Tractor Sodas are a tasty alternative to the usual high fructose corn syrup drinks. I prefer eating here to a big chain, because I know where my dollars are going and the good they are doing. Plenty of parking and indoor seating. This is the best Mexican food in the arts district."}
{"text":"I popped in to this little gem by accident at the arts factory on a rainy night. It sounds like a cheesy love affair. It is.  I'm from the East Coast where this feels as much like a pizza place that I would visit every Friday night. The atmosphere is automotive steam punk. The food is made in house. Fresh pressed tortillas. The pork was really flavorful. Organic soda from Tractor is a welcome option.  Las Vegas is missing restaurants that have a singular offering with passion and pride behind the counter. I found one."}
{"text":"I was craving some Mexican food after a few drinks at Starboard Tack. The bartender told us of this place. Not only was it just a few minutes away, the food was amazing!! I had the flat iron steak burrito and my husband had pulled pork. Everything was fresh and tasted amazing. We added the fried cheese to our burritos. The was probably the best addition I never knew existed. Side note to the food they have a regular soda machine and tractor sodas!!!  I mixed their coconut soda with coke and made my very own dirty coke. For a few bucks more I could've added rum!  Thumbs up to this place for taste, cost was good and service was amazing. We will be back next week."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the smoked pork bowl, with a side of delicious homemade tortillas, and topped with a fried egg - over medium. The meal was amazing, the meat wasn't all fatty and gross, the toppings were fresh and flavorful, and the dish was large enough for me to take the leftovers home for dinner.   This place is right around the corner from my job, and I will soon be a regular! Oh, and I got a coconut fountain soda! How cool is that? Come eat at Tacos Huevos, you'll be so glad you did."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! Like literally so amazing! I'm so sad I'm from LA cause if I lived in Vegas I would be eating here everyday! Their meats are so flavorful and delicious! They make everything fresh and their flavors are out of the charts! If you visit Vegas, coming here is a must!!! The staff is so friendly and caring! You feel so welcomed! Honestly it's my favorite place from all the places I have ever been to eat! I hope they open a location in Los Angeles!!"}
{"text":"Had a custom made salad topped with smoked shredded pork, an over easy egg, and wicked good salsa.  Then a big Diet Coke with a spritz of the coconut soda.  Reasonably priced, yummy, and a hidden gem.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Weird place. The layout is odd, you buy in one room, then move into a communal area to eat (there are other restaurants in the building). To get to the bathroom, I had to walk through a closed business next door and a hallway.   The food was good but not great, and I got an upset stomach after having the tacos."}
{"text":"This place is an excellent place from friends Romantic dates to a great place for the family. the meat is Amazing.  The place is relaxing and enjoyable. The food is Extraordinary!!! The Drinks are beyond Delicious !!!  So refreshing!!  Its so good you think your in town center on the top floor of an Executive suite! It's good gourmet all over it in the price blows my mind because it is affordable for anyone and everyone . Just take a shower before you get there."}
{"text":"We ordered the taco plate which comes with rice and beans.  The food AND the service are AWESOME!!!  We HIGHLY recommend this place for authentic street tacos and amazing food!!  I just finished and already I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Just quality food.  Clean place.  Unique sodas.  Lil spendy, but prolly the best burrito I've ever had."}
{"text":"TACOS I am not sure what the hype is about because it's definitely A-OK. I ordered a rotisserie taco and slow cooked & smoked pork taco; both had cilantro, onions, mild salsa, and some sorta of cheese. The meat itself are flavorless, dry, and drenched in juices that made the tortilla super soggy and fall apart. The only pro was that they were generous with the amount of meat so I was full with 2 tacos.  SERVICE It was empty on a Saturday afternoon, so I didn't have to wait to order. The same girl who took and made my order also checked me out at the register. She was nice, made suggestions, and tried to engage in a convo so I appreciate it.  AMBIANCE Very modern, plenty of seatings, and wood themed.   OVERALL I probably won't return because the tacos are not as flavorful compared to other places, and are somewhat overpriced."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Awesome customer service from both the owner himself and the rest of the staff. Tons of fresh organic food. Awesome designs. Will be back every time I come through Vegas!"}
{"text":"this place blew my mind, it's like a build your own breakfast burrito. My friend got a bean and cheese burrito with potatoes, and CHEESY EGGS! it was so cheap, the serving size was more than enough for the both of us and it was so delicious! I got a single flat iron steak taco and added pico for 25¢, the total came out to be like 2$ and it was so good. Everything here is made FRESH. If only the drive wasn't so far from my house /: but if I'm ever in the area again, I'd most definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"The best tacos and burritos. Pure authentic Mexican food. The guys here are great too!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this taco spot, but it isn't your ordinary taco place. It has a hip twist to it and what I loved most about it. Everything was made fresh and the quality of the food was amazing. Really digging the design and layout of the place. You will see me back again!"}
{"text":"The owner is super nice, the people working there are awesome! I got the taco plate which came with rice and beans. The beans were okay and the rice didn't really have flavor. I got a chicken taco which was awesome! I like the chicken more than the steak. Ask for the ajo sauce!! It's a must!!!! The tortillas are made fresh and they are so worth it!!!! Cool atmosphere and there's a lot to do nearby being that it's located inside the arts factory."}
{"text":"This place is in a great spot in the Arts District.  Food is quick, fresh and delish!  They even have great Pho-meat options which my husband loved.  Kid-friendly and spacious too."}
{"text":"I loved the concept here. Loved the interior as well. Place has a really good vibe.   We ordered 3 street tacos, two chicken and one pork. They made the tortillas right then when we ordered. That was fun to watch, as there is a window into the kitchen. Then there is the toppings station where you can opt for different things such as cheese, sour cream, etc. We chose for the original street taco toppings of onion, cilantro and salsa. I chose the medium, green salsa.   It is cafeteria style in a sense, as you take your tray of food down the line, and then over to the register right behind you. There are some really great looking organic sodas such as blood orange, ginger beer, cherry cream and others. We opted for the regular selection of sodas this time. Not feeling adventurous, I guess.   I was really excited to try my chicken taco as I was told that it was made with rotisserie chicken. The tortillas were sturdy and tasty, and filled with a lot of ingredients. Although very moist, the chicken was extremely bland. All of the flavor came from the toppings and the tortilla. My husband had the pork taco and said that it was really flavorful. I might try that next time. The medium salsa was actually on the spicy side. Lots of flavor. We got the chips and salsa as well, and opted for medium and hot as our two choices of salsa. The hot was definitely made with habaneros, and was hot. Both were very fresh and had good flavor.   I really like this taco place, and would love to come back for more. Really good value here, as everything is FRESH. Everyone working there was pleasant as well. The place was clean, so all in all this was a nice find."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  This is like a chipotle style burrito and taco place but a million times better. The breakfast burrito was so huge and delicious. My husband and I shared one and were so full. Great bang for your buck. The melted cheese is just the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Delicious farm to table tacos. Located at the Art Distric just a couple blocks from the outlet. Tacos are delicious. Ordered the rotesserie chicken, slow cooked & smoked pork and flat iron steak tacos. For drinks besides the usual fountain selection they also have Tractor soda: tractor cola, blood orange, coconut, ginger beer, cherry cream and root beer. And best part is the hand made tortilla and the salsa is very tasty with a nice kick to it.  Indoor ac seating or outdoor patio seating area both shaded and non shaded.   Love this place and my 11 yrs old son approved."}
{"text":"I was walking arround by art district and I saw this place so I gave it a try. It is a cool place to hang out and clean. The owner Chris Pike & the employee are so nice, polite & helpfull. They have a huge portion, I saw somebody else ordered nachos.. OMG looks delicious & huge. I think that nachos can share for 3 peoples. Their meats & vegetables are so fresh and really have good flavor. I think they make their tortillas fresh too because it did not taste like store bought..so so so gooddd You can ordered a single taco or build your own burrito, bowl or taco plate (2 tacos) comes with rice + beans (pinto or black or combination) + egg + melted cheese also choice of vegetables (cilantro, onion, lettuce etc) + salsa (mild, hot, green)+ sour cream. Guacamole extra charge. Me and my friend shared steak taco plate $8.95, it was fill us up. We enjoyed the food a lot Definitely will be back!!!! You should try it"}
{"text":"Got a tip about this place from a friend who said it was well worth checking out. So between hotel checkout and our flight, we taxied over to have brunch yesterday. My wife and I both had the chicken bowl and we're floored by how good the food was. Fresh ingredients, great taste and an egg to top it off. Will strongly recommend."}
{"text":"What a great surprise! We were visiting the Art district and stumbled upon this place. We had the pork bowl with fried cheese, egg, & pork...out of this world! Fresh, moist and flavorful pork. The others fresh ingredients used to top the dish were plentiful and very tasty. We also had the pork tacos made with homemade corn tortillas which were the best we ever had. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is like Chipotle done right. Can't beat the price and the food is Great! Over easy egg and melted cheese on top of the bowl sets the whole thing off! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Leaving Vegas found some Mexican food. Very hip spot. Food was  amazing along with the  prices. Juan helped us out, very personable and knowledgeable about the restaurant. Next time we are in Vegas we will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff. Love the fresh tortillas!  Very nice addition to The Arts Factory!"}
{"text":"Ok, so the place is hard to find because of poor signs and advertising.  Walked in and you order at a window. We're the FIRST and for a few minutes the ONLY people here. We order and surprise they run out of their \"handmade tacos\". Manager says he'll make the tacos and BRING THEM to us.  After 15 minutes I have to go up to the manager who is at the register, has served OTHER people tacos and then proceeds to ask me what I need.  I tell him I'm waiting for my wife's order. He asks \"what did she order?\"  ARE YOU F@$KING KIDDING ME? There is no one here and when people do come in you serve others first? You forget a simple order? You tell a new and never again customer to go screw himself! Nice!! How about you pull your head out and serve customers in totality in the order in which they came??!!  What a concept!  Avoid this place! Food is not worth dealing with these idiots. Manager never apologized or said kiss my a&$.  Great attitude."}
{"text":"This place is very clean and staff is friendly, the food was good and with freshly made corn tortillas. But i did feel it needed a little more flavor, but over all nice experience"}
{"text":"OMG I yelped this place it was 3 mins away and I really wanted a great taco. This place rocks amazing fresh authentic style Mexican food. Tiffany took our order and was very informative, super polite & made us feel very welcome! Considering this place has only been opened for 3 months I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"Tacos Huevos was a delicious welcome to the city of Las Vegas. I had the chicken, pork, and steak tacos.   Bottom Line - the food was as much a spectacular work of art as it was a reinvention of the worlds greatest taco.   Fantastic."}
{"text":"Great place! Basically an upgraded version of Chipotle. Everything is so fresh, organic, and high quality ingredients. I got a taco salad with rotisserie chicken on it. Then you pick all the toppings. He even through an over easy egg on top with was delicious. Lots of food not a bad price either. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! I customized a bowl with vegan beef. I highly recommend it..I've been sleeping on this place for too long when it's so close to my house. Glad I finally tried it. I suggest dining in."}
{"text":"Amazing! So yummy! I got tacos with an easy egg and melted cheese- loved it! My hubby got the bowl and kids got street tacos. We definitely will come back! Big portions and great prices."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! We were on way home to L.A and we found this amazing place! The cheese quesadilla with steak were the best I ever had! We will definitely be coming back some other time! Such amazing food!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers, would have never found this 5 star taco shop without you! Those of you who haven't ventured downtown in the heart of the arts district, to eat the most amazing tostada ever... Go Now! I highly recommend the black bean tostada. I personally load it with almost every topping in the fresh topping bar, and please, I beg of you....  add the melted cheese and over easy egg! Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"unique breakfast place. Kinda hard to find but I blame some of that on Google maps.  Staff wad super friendly and explained the whole ordering prices to us.  Decor didn't make any sense and the bathroom was currently under construction.  I really liked that all the ingredients were out in the front so you could see the options and the quality"}
{"text":"Originally I loved my first experience here. Second time around was bad enough to never return. Screwed up every aspect of the order, left items out and the tacos were cold. Manager told me I could get my correct order but it would take at least an hour more. Too many taco places in Vegas to ever return"}
{"text":"Yum yum yummy amazing food great staff. Very acomadating for people with food allergy.Taco plate was great"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's so cool! Came early in the morning for breakfast. We had THE BEST breakfast burritos that seriously seem to weigh 10 lbs. Their sauce is savory that you won't be able to put your food down. The food is great. The staff is nice. The place is clean. The ambiance is trendy. Thanks for having us!"}
{"text":"First time here and it is fantastic . Can't beat eggs & tacos.. great combination.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas first time to Tacos Huevos. Saw the good reviews on yelp and walked a mile to get here. Well worth it the reviews are correct. Great fresh food and the owner / employees absolutely  best customer service."}
{"text":"Definitely the best vegan Mexican food around. Lots of options, chicken/beef/cheese, Vegan. It's beautiful to know you're catered too! My boyfriend a meat eater, highly suggests the egg on the burrito and tacos. He loves their steak and pork! Also they can top your delicious food with melted cheese, SO good! Definitely give them a try and fall in love like we did!"}
{"text":"Really loved my chicken bowl with the coconut soda I got it was soo delicious! First time stoping by, but definitely not the last."}
{"text":"Fresh meats like rotisserie chicken and pork nachos, tostadas, tacos. You can build it up or down. Great services  and good prices. FRESH"}
{"text":"My bf went to pick up a steak burrito for me, came back with no steak in it! He had even given the person a list of ingredients I wanted (because I knew he'd mess it up) I'm not sure how he even didn't notice that the person didn't put any meat in my burrito! However, everything was super tasty, and the spicy tomatillo salsa was delish. I plan to go back for a redemption burrito."}
{"text":"Opening today is Tacos Huevos in the arts district of Las Vegas.  When the first thing you see is handmade tortillas in the window you know your at a special place. The chicken is also being cooked in a rotisserie. Handmade flavors bring you right into the heart of Mexico off of the Las Vegas strip. I had a taco of eggs, perfectly seasoned melt in your mouth sausage, shredded lettuce, Creme fresh and a home made green sauce that pulled everything together to form taco magic. This is a gem. A taco bucket list. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is such a chill place, it was right next to us and they do have parking, & an indoor & outdoor seating! We had a steak burrito with some salsa and chips. This salsa were super good - they had a mild and spicy.  I had the green salsa, which was perfect! The employees were super nice and welcoming (especially Chino, \"guera\" and Cubano). I highly recommend coming here for breakfast/brunch! You can never go wrong with Mexican food. (Forgot to say, my bf and I split the burrito, so it's a whole one)"}
{"text":"Super unfriendly staff. This was more bland and fake than Chipotle. Vegan chicken was pretty bad and they don't have vegan rice.  Reply to owner: I was here yesterday morning. I am positive I am writing a review for the right restaurant - Tacos Huevos in the Arts district of Las Vegas. I ordered the vegan chicken, and the girl said 'the rice has a little bit of chicken broth in it, is that OK?\" I said no, and ordered my burrito without rice."}
{"text":"First time going in here and didn't know what to expect! We had the menu explained to us in great detail. My burrito was topped with melted cheese and I could have gotten a fresh egg but that's not my thing. My boyfriend got an over easy egg on his burrito bowl and it was pretty to look at. We devoured everything. The portions were big and I still ate it all. I'm happy we finally decided to come in. I hope this place does well! The organic sodas were excellent. Loved the vibe. Thanks Chris!"}
{"text":"this places is the bessst!!!! everything was super delicious and i can see why it has 5 stars"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Chicken  Stopped by this small intimate restaurant after shaking my money maker next door st Urban Lounge.  First of all the tortillas are made fresh to order & the vegetarian chicken (soy of course Gardein brand) was cooked to order pipping hot and yummy.  I ordered the (2) street tacos for nearly $4.00! I'm pleased with the quick service, polite staff, fresh ingredients and wallet friendly pricing. I'll definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Found this place on restaurant.com and man oh man is it awesome. My wife and I, along with our friends from out of town, enjoyed some of the best burritos. I've never had a burrito, with eggs added, that wasn't a full on breakfast burrito. Amazing experience. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"seriously the portions at this place are huge!  every bite of my burrito was heaven!    customer service was amazing!  the man that served us was so nice and hospitable.  I wish i remembered his name!"}
{"text":"Let me save you all some time.  This is the best Mexican food in Vegas.  I know that's quite a claim, but I don't say it lightly.   Super delicious and the staff was incredible.  Do yourself a favor and eat here.   I will DEFINITELY come EVERY time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Since moving out here from Cali I have had such a hard time finding a good taco place but since I found this amazing little gem I am happy to say I have found my new taco place...the chicken tacos are life and the rice is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ingredients are fresh, flavors were spot on, and the owner was super friendly. This food is amazing, and their green cilantro dressing was the perfect touch to my steak salad and my wife's breakfast egg & chicken tacos. Great job y'all from us foodies from New Orleans!!!"}
{"text":"My first time there. The service is great! Very friendly and helpful, the owner took his time in walking us through the menu. They season there steak with just salt and pepper and a bit of lime. Not dry at all, has a moist texture to the meat. I really liked the bowl with the steak. The prices are really Fair! I think it's worth the amount you pay for, my finace got the burrito and that thing is huge! He really enjoyed it as well. I would definitely recommend! If your looking for something not too expensive. The place looks nice and clean. They also have an outdoor seating area. Overall I really like it there!"}
{"text":"Ordering was a bit confusing at first, but damn, the food here is GOOD!!  Absolutely blows Chipotle away! The portions are big, so make sure you come hungry.   I got the bowl and wifey got the tacos. I thought mine was perfect, though she thought hers was a bit salty.  We got chicken, pork, and steak for our meats. I'd recommend going with pork (the guy at the store recommended this) and the steak, both are excellent - chicken is okay.   They give you this fried cheese thing which is pretty neat.   They also have some unique sodas to try.   Customer service was exceptional. Store was very empty when we came.   Would definitely come back again and bring friends too."}
{"text":"Healthy fresh tacos. Met the owner. He is such a nice friendly guy. Love this place. All the food is made with love. Local art on the walls. A big patio outside in a great artsy area. Try it!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito ever!!! Honestly, I can say I like this place better than any other breakfast spot! The food is to die for and customer service is incredible. The same two guys have attended us both times we have come. They are very friendly and do a great job.  First time we came one of them asked if we had been here before. Of course we said no and he guided us thru the menu. He also told us the process which is building your own burrito.  One of my sister fell in love with it because she is so picky. Right here she can choose everything she wants and doesn't want in her burrito. She can see everything they are doing. Me on the other hand, I love everything. Still love that I can choose.  I can say this is a hidden gem in Las Vegas. There is plenty of space inside to eat and they have an outdoor seating area. Restaurant is beautiful and they have parking.   They do have way more on the menu like tacos, quesadillas, and BEER. Looks like they have everything and you basically make it yourself. My mouth waters everytime they are making my burrito. Love absolutely  love this spot!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Great atmosphere and decor.  The food...blew me away.  I was in Vegas for the weekend and was recommended to try this place in the Arts District.  Bring your appetite...especially if you get a burrito.  Everything is made to order and you can add eggs and melted cheese to anything."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in town. Juan makes yhe best burritos. This place is great for lunch or for late night munchies. The staff is awesome, the place itself is great. I highly recommend Tacos Huevos:"}
{"text":"In town for a conference, wanted to explore a bit off of the strip. Stumbled upon Tacos Huevos and I am glad I did. Super friendly employees and fantastic food. Couldn't ask for anything else.  Get the slow cooked pork."}
{"text":"Hey, what are you doing right now? Nope, stop what you are doing and grab the best breakfast burrito ever!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something different in the area and decided to stop by Tacos Huevos in the arts district. It's designed like Chipotle where you can build your own tacos, burrito or bowl. The employee making my burrito was very friendly and helpful. I tried the steak burrito which was really tasty, and huge- I could only eat half of it in one sitting. I definitely recommend stopping by and giving this place a try. I hope to go back and try the breakfast based on all the positive reviews I've been seeing."}
{"text":"OMG!!! All the other Yelp reviews are correct...THIS PLACE IS BOMB!!! I took my son to TH for lunch and we each had the pork tacos. Holy crap. The pork is so juicy and tender I thought I'd died and gone to pork heaven. The melted cheese was incredible and the other toppings delicious. The Ajo Sauce is great...not spicy, but so flavorful. Next time I'll get some of the hot salsa on the side to kick up the heat.  There are two types of both rice and beans. I chose the traditional Spanish-style rice and the refried pinto beans. My son got the black beans. All were really good. Next time I'll see about some chips and salsa to put a bow on the meal.  The Tractor Sodas are great. We don't typically drink soda, but these were worth the caloric splurge.  All in all, we LOVED this place! Plenty of convenient parking in the lot next door (by Artifice). Not hard to find at all. It's in the Arts Factory on Charleston and Main...East side, ground floor, enter from the courtyard. Great vibe. Excellent service! Amazeballs food!! And a cool, swanky atmosphere to boot. Great job Tacos Huevos! We'll be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Breakfast plate was maybe the best thing I've eaten this month. It's fast casual or \"chipotle style\" so it was quick but still tasted very fresh. Would definitely recommend to anybody in Vegas who wants a filling meal!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! We picked this spot because it was only a block from our airbnb, in an up-and-coming area known as the art district. Tacos huevos fits that mold perfectly: cool vibe, friendly and fast service, and incredible food. The tacos can be a bit messy (not a bad thing), but you can get a burrito or a bowl if you don't want to soil your threads. 10/10 would go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by during their \"soft opening\". Tacos served like \"Chipotle-style\" where you choose the ingredients. I had one each chicken and steak. Wow! So tasty! I wanted to go back for more! They were stuffed full of all my topping choices, including scrambled eggs and guacamole. We'll be coming back here again and again!"}
{"text":"Tacos Huevos was recommended by Stefany V as a meetup spot for the first Yelp Book Club of the year.  While I was the only member in attendance on Saturday, I was far from disappointed.    I don't come downtown too often...parking worries me.  I can never seem to find a spot to park that doesn't involve paying to park.    Imagine my delight, then, when I arrived at Tacos Huevos, and found ample FREE parking!!!    TH was super easy to find, and there is plenty of seating, both inside and out.  I walked in, and was greeted by Chris, who I found out is the owner.  He went over the menu with me, after discovering that it was my first time in.     The set up is kind of a Chipotle/Subway style \"build your own\" spot, with a la carte options as well.    Saturday, I opted for:  a   slow cooked and smoked pork bowl, and 1 street taco:  steak.  The bowl comes with rice, beans, meat, and whatever toppings you want.  I got mine with a scrambled egg, a ton of salsas and veggies, and a little sour cream.    Let me say:  this was HUGE.  Like...I should have only ordered the bowl, because I was stuffed after eating the taco and a few bites of the bowl.  But I pushed through.    The pork was super tender, flavorful, and amazing.  If you know me, you know I'm not usually a fan of pork, but for some reason, I just had to try this.  I'm really glad I did.    I also had a steak taco, with onions, cilantro, and some melted cheese.  The cheese is totally worth the 35 cents extra.  SO delicious!!  The steak was good, nice and tender.    I also had a margarita.  Because tequila.  It was also delicious!    Chris showed me the selection of organic sodas they offer, and let me know that you can get a spiked soda with organic tequila, vodka, or...something else.  I tuned out at tequila.  Next time I go, I'm totally getting a spiked blood orange soda.    Service was extremely friendly.  The food was phenomenal.  The place is clean, bright, and open.  Prices are totally reasonable, especially given the downtown location.  You most definitely get your money's worth here.  They also offer vegan options, and desserts!     I definitely not only recommend Tacos Huevos, but plan to return VERY soon to try more of the food!"}
{"text":"Had the street tacos...one of each.  Chicken, pork and steak.  All delicious.  They put melted cheese on top.  Not cheese sauce, actual melted cheese.  Really good!!!"}
{"text":"Set in the Art district by the N Premium Outlet mall, this newer taco spot is quite the rage on Yelp.  Tacos Huevos offers a nice \"non-franchised\" alternative on fresh Mexican food.  The ingredients are fresh, staff very service oriented, and spacious seating area indoor and outdoor.  The breakfast burrito was mega huge, tasty, and the steak had no fat what so ever.  A must if you find yourself in the area.   Only recommendation is to offer grilled/sautéed onions to add flavor, and some more kick to the medium salsa.  Overall, 2 thumbs up!  *** tip:  if you're heading East on Charleston and turning left  on Art St, don't make a U turn like map quest tells you.  Just make the left turn and it's directly on your left."}
{"text":"I've never experienced vegan like this before : all organic , fresh ingredients , open kitchen ( I wanna see it made ) , and the selection ( vegan chicken , vegan beef cubes or diced ) . I was brought  here by my friend Leah & I'm beyond thankful she forced me to try this place. Staff was super friendly and they will accommodate any picky eater ; even me . Its located in Arts District, lots of parking & patio for people watching at night with a cold beer . They even serve organic flavored soda !!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast with hubby and toddler,  the food was amazing, it was fresh even my picky toddler loved it she also loved the outside patio area."}
{"text":"Vegan beef tacos are so delicious!!! I was so good. Everything made from scratch especially the tortillas. Mmmmm..... not too expensive and the service is great. Perfect right in the heart of the arts district."}
{"text":"This place had amazing scratch food, you could see them pulling the chickens that they rotisserie cooked that day. The smoked pork had a pronounced taste. They have this strong \"ajo\" sauce that was like a garlic chimichurri or something. Get it for sure....  The side dining room had this cool low-rider theme feel, and they had this cool soda machine called Tractor that was not coke or Pepsi (though they have a coke fountain as well)   The staff was super friendly too."}
{"text":"Located in the suddenly rejuvenated Arts District and offering \"Unique Mexican quick serve Cuisine\" it was for Breakfast on Saturday that a visit was paid to Tacos Huevos on East Charleston, the spot originally noticed thanks to its raucous patio after a disastrous dinner at Mingo Kitchen empty save for one other couple at 9:30am.  Open for \"Breakfast, Brunch and Brinner\" per the website and luring in Instagrammers by way of Yassss Yolk Porn and Savage Cheese Pulls, the fenced-patio yielding entry to an L-shaped space with counter and kitchen to the right and a sort of Mexican Steampunk dining room to the left, it was while standing back assessing the situation that a pleasant Hispanic cook stood waiting and happy to answer questions, the menu admittedly a bit confusing to those who haven't previously examined it closely.  Suggested as an alternative to \"boring breakfasts and drunken Taco Bell drive throughs after a kick ass night in sin city\" as though this was some sort of challenge, the offerings in reality more akin to Chipotle with Tacos, Bowls, Burritos, Salads, Tostadas, or Nachos offered as a base to various Meats and Protein-substitutes plus unlimited \"healthy ingredients\" that make one question whether fresh = healthy in 2018, it was after a quick bit of mental math and judgment of the days plan that three Tacos, a Burrito plus one Dessert and Coffee were ordered at a total cost of $32.20 before tip.   Requesting half of the order for dine-in and half packed to-go, though parts of each were tasted in the dining room while still hot, it was while Dessert was being prepared that Tacos topped with flavorless Rotisserie Chicken, Steak and smoked Pork were found to be largely indistinguishable from one another beneath melted Cheese and a fairly standard list of Toppings, the over-medium Egg served sloppily on the side really serving no purpose even though the website suggests \"eggs and tacos go together like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera\"...which apparently means together but separate with the later prone to affairs?  At this point figuring it safe to further poke fun at the online hyperbole, the \"idea that subtle infusions in Mexican food can have a profound impact\" probably a bit high-brow for Quick Casual, it was turning attention to a forearm-size Burrito that the best of Tacos Huevos offerings was discovered, the chopped Sausage featuring a smooth grind and nicely matched to a fluffy Omelet, Cheese and Corn while a $9 \"Nutelladilla\" suggested for two or more was easily finished by one, the sweet Spread plus Butter and Cinnamon-Sugar becoming nice and crisp beneath Whipped Cream and a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.  **1/2:  Not particularly 'bad,' and certainly more fresh or unique than Rubio's, Baja Fresh or Chipotle, Tacos Huevos would be well served to know its role and focus on seasoning its Meats rather than coming up with odd hooks that likely won't do much but annoy \"discerning patrons.\""}
{"text":"My burrito was amazing. However the back of the house is very disorganized howev. Get that together and you'll have one of the best mexican joints downtown.   Thanks for getting back to me. It speaks volumes that you took the time to reply back. I'll definitely be back and update."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I wish we had a place like this in Newport Beach. They have a great patio and seems to get a artsy crowd. I went for a few tacos, which were delicious and ended up staying for hours. If I lived in Vegas I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"Easy parking. Great fried mexican cheese on most everything. Breakfast bowl with steak was the best. Build your own like subay but such quality ingredients. Ill be back."}
{"text":"Neighborhood locals, first time visit, definitely won't be our last! Came in for breakfast, had a steak burrito, added melted cheese!! Wow!!! My tastebuds are still thanking me for that experience!!! The owner Chris made our food, and you can just tell how passionate and committed he is to making sure you have a great meal!! Everyone was super nice and helpful. Thank you for making our neighborhood even more amazing!"}
{"text":"The service was the best we've received in Las Vegas. our server and chef juan was friendly and gave great service. we had lunch outside with a nice view and the Sun keeping us warm. the food was delicious! I highly  recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. I was really excited to check it out because of the previous reviews. It has hand made tortillas so that's definitely a plus but the rest of the ingredients are ready made (think Chipotle or Subway style) except for the eggs which are made to order. When I got there (11 am on a Saturday) they were already out of stuff like breakfast potatoes and bacon.  I also thought the rice, beans, and steak could use some seasoning."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty. Great flavor.   The employees were very friendly and helpful.     The Tractor organic soda has great flavor.  I bad to get a sample of each flavor.     This was by far the best meal I had while i was on vacation."}
{"text":"Holy moly talk about mass confusion going on. I ordered a bowl and 2 tacos. They started my bowl about 10 Times. Rang me up and forgot to make the 2 tacos. I reordered the tacos. Went outside to eat the bowl went back in to get the tacos and they already forgot to make them again. Now they asked me again \"ah what kind of tacos were they again?\" I reordered the tacos again and went back outside to finish the bowl and told my wife I'm not going back again for the tacos. Five minutes later my wife goes in for the tacos and they tell her they haven't started them yet we'll let you know when they're done. The man working told my wife the tacos would now be on the house. But I already payed for them!!!!????!!!!  They apologized and kept telling us how slammed they were. Normally I'm very lenient when people are slammed and I am very patient. But you have to know that when I entered there was only 2 people in the whole place then about 4 entered after me. At this point the men working seemed as though they turned into chickens with their heads cut off.   Everyone has bad days so let's hope the staff gets some training and can handle 4 customers with out frantic loss of concentration."}
{"text":"Vegan friendly!! They have vegan cheese, and Gardein steak and chicken. Lovely lil patio. Great service, they'll explain to you everything in their food and how they make it. Tortillas and pickled carrots made in house. Soooooooo good if you're craving a bowl or tacos. Our food was bomb. Would definitely come back and try the breakfast if I could but hope this place sticks around!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start... we were looking for something new to try for breakfast. When I yelped breakfast this place popped up and had a 5 star status, so we thought we would try it out. I am so disappointed.  I truly don't know how it has 5 stars. We walked in right as it opened. I am assuming it was the owner there and he stated someone just called off so he was by himself and he was almost ready.  We patiently waited. While we waited we decided to have a soda.  The soda was completely flat, no carbonation. I didn't feel like saying anything because this poor guy was already frantic that he was alone. My man had a breakfast buritto and I had the breakfast taco combo. We both had the melted cheese on top of each. My man had the steak breakfast buritto and I had sausage and egg tacos.  We both had the refried pinto beans. ICE COLD. good flavor but COLD. cheese didn't even try to melt.  The sausage on my tacos were dripping with grease. My man said his entire buritto was cold, overwhelming amount of beans on them to where he really couldn't taste anything else. I wish I could say something positive but I just can't. Just disappointed!"}
{"text":"Slow version of chipoltle style taco, burrito and bowls. Ingredients were very fresh and tasty and all natural. Great vegan chicken! They need to work on getting the food out quicker, but it's an excellent choice for lunch! Get off the strip and hit the art district baby!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their burritos put Chipotle to shame. Quality ingredients. And the staff is super friendly. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The place was great the food was made specialty to what we requested. They Didn't have chilaquilas   on the menu but he went ahead and made it and they were good. It's a small place kinda hidden but worth trying out."}
{"text":"Large fresh burritos. Clean place with helpful staff. My go to place for a great burrito."}
{"text":"This place deserves all 5 stars. Here's why I feel this is a 5.  First, the man behind the counter came out to assist me right away with how to order and explained the menu. There was no one waiting at the time but still, he was eager to help with complete kindness.   Then the preparation of the food is all freshly made and he even still walked me through that process. You can add all types of toppings to make it specific for your tastes without getting charge so much extra if you buy a plated meal. All the meat choices are made in house with love. The chicken is cooked and pulled in house. The pork is smoked for 12 hours with cherrywood and has a magnificent flavor that makes you feel like you are eating a great bbq place.   The beans are great with a little cotija cheese sprinkled on them. The Mexican rice is very good too. The guacamole has a tiny bit of tomatoes so as not to ruin the fresh flavor of avocado. The tomatillo salsa is awesome an not too spicy. So so good. The chips are made in house too.   I will have to come back for more items to see how many more amazing things they can prepare. As for now they've won me over with service, quality, and taste!"}
{"text":"Ask the owner/manager to make/pick your dish for you. It will throw him off a little, but hot dayummm! So good! He made me a special bowl. Did. Not. Disappoint. Will be coming back, guaranteed."}
{"text":"Food was good. Came here with a few guys I work with and the park is awesome! Came back on Saturday to bring my family it was a different experience. They have a young girl that shouldn't be prepping the food. She was so slow and couldn't even roll the burrito. And forgot the cheese and egg on 2 of the burritos. We had to go back and ask for them twice, and they were sitting behind her. So if you go, ask for a young guy with his hat backwards. He is the best. And ask for the green garlic sauce, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Their food is terrific! Steak was freshly grilled and very flavorful. They melt cheese and top your burrito, salad or rice bowl with it. The homemade green sauce is amazing. Their service was so personable and friendly. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The owner greeted us as we walked thru the door and explained the menu and options. The food is fresh and tastes great. The service has always been amazing and we have gone multiple times and it just keeps getting better. Bravo!"}
{"text":"The menu is available on screens above the food line, but it doesn't really matter because you can make anything youe heart desires! I really enjoy the vegetarian/vegan options and how fresh all the ingredients are. Food portions are fairly large and very filling!   Ask for the Ajo sauce. It's a creamy cilantro/garlic sauce that is to die for! Also, the soda selection is unique with organic Tractor soda. Delicious flavors!   I'm impressed by the prices as well. Highly recommend! Easy to find, on the northwest corner of Charleston and Casino Center! I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"My new favorite burrito place in Vegas. The veggie chicken and veggie steak are amazing. Perfect for us vegetarians and vegans. Al was kind enough to explain all of the options to us. Everything was fresh and tasted delicious. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday on the Vegas Valley Food Tours.  Great space and the owner is super nice.  We had street tacos and they were so good!  The green sauce is to die for.  While we were waiting, we saw people ordering the burrito type bowls and they were huge and looked fantastic!  I'm coming back for one.  Also the burritos looked fantastic.  They looked like they could feed a family of four!  Our street tacos were wonderful.  Homemade tortillas, fried cheese and meat, pico de gallo.  The steak was my favorite.  Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Tacos were fab. Chicken is better than the slow roasted pork.   Burrito was super good!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Real authentic Mexican food. The meat is fresh the toppings are fresh. EVERYTHING IS FRESH. And it doesn't have that dreaded heavy ass garlic taste that every other wanna be Mexican place in Vegas has just to cover up the fact that they really don't have good food.   I really hope this place stays busy and picks up. Every time I've been in they've been dead, maybe they are more busy on the weekends? Maybe it's their location? Not sure but I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time and the food was amazing!! I ordered a burrito that was huge and delicious. My husband ordered a burrito too and said it was the best he's ever had. I don't know how we missed this place in the past. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and ordered 3 street tacos: rotisserie chicken, smoked pork and flat iron steak and boyfriend ordered the breakfast plate that came with sausage, breakfast potatoes, re fried black beans, Mexican rice and two eggs over easy. I liked that they make their own tortillas, but was a little disappointed that they didn't warm them up on a griddle prior to serving. This place operates similar to Chipotle where you choose your base, meat and toppings. Most of the food is already cooked so when you order its pretty much just assembling your food. The chicken was a little dry. Pork taco had the best flavor and steak was good. Salsas were really good. Got both red salsas. The spiciest salsa I felt was a little on the salty side. The other red salsa was a chunkier salsa with better flavor. They have this killer green sauce similar to the green sauce you get when you order Peruvian food made up of cilantro, jalapeños, mayo and I'm sure a lot more. Breakfast platter was okay. Nothing really stood out to me. Overall a tasty restaurant, but not sure I would go out of my way to eat here when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Update: came back and service was pretty fast food tasted good. Glad I gave it a second chance."}
{"text":"First time eating at this place and we made the right choice. Tiffany who was working behind the counter was awesome :) the food was out of this world good. I will be eating there one more time before I go back to Hawaii on Friday:)"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite spot to grab a burrito. It's always fresh. The meats are packed with flavor, everything is easy to customize and there is so much space. The patio is huge and fun to sip margaritas, and the inside is well air conditioned so you'll be set as things start to heat up.   My favorites are the pork or breakfast burrito with bacon. You can add an egg to your burrito and I go for over medium. Whites cooked, yolks runny. The melted cheese option is amazing.   I love this place but service is always slow. It's never quite busy enough to justify more staff but there isn't any rhyme or reason to how you order and then get rung up. It's still really confusing.   Work in progress. But delicious and well on their way to a five star experience if they can work out some more ordering kinks."}
{"text":"They are located in Art District. It was first time being there. We LOVED the food and the ambiance  very friendly staff was a plus . We will definitely go back . highly recommend"}
{"text":"Service was good, the employees were nice. However, the food quality was just very poor. I cannot give more than two stars on this place because of that. Overpriced"}
{"text":"Yelp did not let me down! This place is worth all 5 stars! One of the best hidden gems in Las Vegas! Plenty of parking too!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, but a little pricey.  The service was slow it took about 20 minutes from start when I ordered my food to when I actually paid for my food. I ordered the carne asada tacos meal with the rice and beans.   The only thing lacking from this restaurant is a sense of urgency."}
{"text":"Great experience this afternoon at tacos huevos! Chicken burrito and steak tacos with fried and scrambled eggs  added melted cheese and just about all the fixings for an excellent meal. Don't forget the house cilantro dressing Everything is fresh and flavorful right down to the organic tractor soda (cola with cinnamon and vanilla). The two guys inside were eager to help us out for us first time here which makes for an even better experience. Be sure to try the soda! We enjoyed our meal on the patio, see you again soon!"}
