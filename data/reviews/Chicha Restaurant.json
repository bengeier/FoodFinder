{"text":"It is exactly what this neighbourhood needs. You can go there for a small snack/dessert or go for a whole meal. They have a great lunch deal as well. Super tasty and great selection!! The first time I went I did not know what to order so I just asked the girl at the counter and she recommended a bunch of dishes that we're all very good. She was really helpful so if you're unsure of what to order don't be afraid to ask. Note that I only took pictures of their savoury items on the menu. They have another page for drinks and desserts."}
{"text":"Super casual, very helpful and friendly service. The only place in montreal where we've found \"oyakodon\" cooked in the authentic Japanese style. I would give this place more stars if it didnt feel so \"diner-ish\" and if there was better ventilation. (A bit stuffy and air is stale from all the cooking).  Maybe I'm just a piggy but I want a smidge more in my portions. :) (Even if it's just more plain white rice to go with my curry!)"}
{"text":"I been here a couple of times and will be going back again. The food is some of the best Asian food I have ever tasted. The meat is actually meat (I hope you understand my meaning). There is a wide range of teas which are very good. Everything is home made, and I am excited to try the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Second visit here and the food has only improved. The first time we ordered tea and appetizers (tempura plate and dumplings) which were both delicious and fresh. This time we stopped in for lunch. I ordered the peanut chicken with rice and my boyfriend had the spicy chicken ramen soup. We were both extremely happy with our dishes. Chicken was well cooked pieces of breast. The peanut sauce was delicious, creamy with peanut chunks. The noodles were by far the best part - chewy, stood up well against the broth, never got soggy and best of all, homemade. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The side dishes were good, but everything else tasted like it had peanut butter sauce inside. It's more American style than Chinese, if that is what you are looking for, go right ahead. The bubble tea was very watery"}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries are recommended! Better than Nos Thes from dt LOL  Overall, it is another version of Nos Thes, a cute Taiwanese resto and milk tea place.  The honey Toast is also fancy (first ever found in Montreal), however you can only find it by chance cuz they do not have it most of the times...  Puffs are way inferior to the ones in China... Mille Feuille crepe cakes are just fine."}
{"text":"My friends heard a lot of good things about it so we went there.  The toast was very good, but the Mille crepe was so-so. The cake did not have enough layers in my opinion.  The service was average as well. The waitress didn't smile. I like the decor here."}
{"text":"Chicha is a quirky and eccentric sort of place. It is kind of a cross between café, restaurant and hangout. They specialise in a sort of Chinese/colonial/Japanese inspired fusion I guess? I don't quite know but everything I've had there has been very very very good. There is this salt and pepper crusted fried mushroom that is excellent. I also get the vegetarian mushroom ramen soup. Specify that you want the vegetarian broth if you don't want to eat any meat. Ask for some Chinese chilli oil to kick it up a notch. Then there is the Japanese-style veggie tempura rice bowl, which is exactly what it sounds like, a bowl of rice with tempura vegetables on top. If you order this, I suggest that you ask that they forego the onion tempura because it's basically onion rings and for me that's not really worthy tempura material. I want some sweet potato, regular potato, broccoli, asparagus and zucchini when it comes to tempura. Have a pot of tea. They've got quite an extensive selection. They also serve some fascinating sweet dishes as well. Try them if you feel like it. My only qualm about this place doesn't get enough business. Come on people! That would make me go from four stars to like four and a half. I always enjoy speaking with the manager, Olivia, about all things Chinese! Now I know a bit more about China and delicious food ... which is always welcomed. Mmm congee. She is quite friendly and also amazingly knowledgeable about the ins and outs of the Chinese restaurant industry in Montréal. In fact, I wish that she were the owner here. I bet she'd make it a five star sort of operation. So check it out, say hello for me and enjoy a warming bowl of soup."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the very tasty Asian dishes. I started with the traditional wonton soup which was fresh and abundant. Then I ordered a chicken tori-Katsu Don at a very reasonable $9.99. The crispy chicken breasts were light, perfectly roasted and crispy. The rice and egg were a pleasant surprise as I scooped up a sweet sauce that was dribbled all over the rice.  The service is personable and quick. We were served lemon water and a hot strawberry green tea.  I know I will be back to try the rest of their menu especially the Yasai Tempura Rice, Special Braised Beef Rice, and Pan fried Dumplings. There is something for everyone.  Cheers to the new opening! Or like they say in Chinese: GON BAY! Which actually means \"Drain your glass.\" At one point in time, people in China actually expected you to drain your glass as quickly as you could. But nowadays, the Chinese Cheers! doesn't require you to drink it all in one gulp!"}
{"text":"Attention!! This is a really cute cafe that just opened! Food is excellent, service is great, and ambiance is nice. I really recommend their rose oolong latte, I think it was the best tea latte I ever had...it was made not too sweet according to my request. Their baked goods are awesome too like the pastry puff that had fresh cream put inside when I decided to buy it. I had also ordered the salt and pepper popcorn chicken with rice and I thought the portion was really good, not too much food. I think this place deserves more exposure because I thought everything was really tasty.  Perfect place to go for coffee, snacks, meals when you are in the NDG area, particularly near Vendome metro."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here. We began with the salt and pepper chicken. It was very flavorful and juicy! For entrees, the spicy beef soup, this tasted very very fresh and home made! The ingredients were subtle and delightful. The noodles were very authentically made. Finally, we enjoyed the green tea layered milles cake. This had the most delicate, sweet flavor and was the perfect end to our meal! Stopped by the next day to enjoy a bubble tea. They had a great flavor selection. You can choose either jelly or pearls in your drink! Let me now begin on telling you how spectacular the service was. The server was very enthusiastic, ensuring that we had a satisfying experience. She made suggestions based upon my refined palette. I am someone who has dined in every crevasse of the world. This place is a pleasure to visit. Thank you chicha cafe for saving my Marrige."}
{"text":"Got the original crepe cake (because they were out of matcha and chocolate). Glad I did though since it was my first time trying it. It had an interesting texture so I'm not sure I would order it again but the flavour was good. I also ordered a large mango roobios iced tea. YUM loved it but then again I am a fan of sweet mango juice.  My sister got the chicken katsu plate and liked it too. Would consider going back and trying some of their savoury options."}
{"text":"Their food is very good, especially the honey toast and seaweed salad. The sauce of the salad tastes wonderful. I will definitely go there second time."}
{"text":"I have been to chicha three times and have little complain regarding to their food. My friends I usually have debit cards on us but this time we all forget bringing it (they were the first time there and I took them because I was impressed by the level of their desert and service). This time, We have no choice but to use credit cards paying the bill, however the owner insisted their machine could not take credit card payments even if we offered that we could pay the service charge. They rudely asked us to go to a pharmacy to advance some cash even if we told him only debit cards can do cash advance. Ironically, we saw the owner was completely silent about a white guy using his MBNA master card to pay, moreover, he lied on our face by saying he was using his debit ok? We did not ask that white guy to reveal the lie from the owner just for the sake of politeness. We are not blind so please don't fool us. Anyways, we ended up saying to him \"try the credit card if it is not being approved we will go to get you cash. He was still telling us his feebly lies again and again by claiming he may not receive our payment... I don't think I will go their cafe again based on today's terrible experience and I strongly suggest people who think they are CHINESE, yes, CHINESE people, do NOT go there and experience such an unfair thing!!"}
{"text":"Really nice lunch spot in the Westmount area, I loved the mellow sunny vibe in this small bright cafe, the friendly service, and the delicious things I ate: spicy beef noodle soup, and the delicious sesame pancake with beef. If this spot was near me I'd be in here all the time but as it is I look forward to coming back soon and trying the vegetarian dishes other Yelpers have mentioned. There is an extensive menu of traditional Japanese dishes and I want to try them all!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the green tea crepe cake.  It was really good!! The first few bites were really bitter, but soon I found out that there were too much green tea powder on top. Then I took out the top layer, it was 100% better! I no longer need to go to NYC/LA to have Lady M's crepe cake!!! They also have some other flavours that are not on the menu, like durian!!! Will definitely come back to try that.  Heard really good things about their honey toast!  But other than that, their drinks were nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Only tried an iced matcha drink which was decent but the service wasn't up to par. The girl at the counter gave me lots of attitude. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a whim since I live in the area and the food was very average if not poor. I got the spicy braised beef noodles and I might as well have just bought some instant ramen and put some shredded veggies on top at home. Noodles were very undercooked but the broth was good.   I asked if I could pay with credit just in case but didn't think to ask about a minimum so I had to buy something on my way out too. I got a small bubble tea which was not good, the pearls were not cooked through. Entire meal came out to $20 for one person.   Verdict: hard pass. Go to maison Seoul if you're in the area and want Asian food. It's a minute away and worth the money. I regret not just going to the dep and picking up a pack of instant ramen."}
{"text":"Close to my place so its my go to bobba spot, never disappoints. Food is basic but affordable, I like to come here for some time alone. It's nice and quiet and the girls are sweet there."}
{"text":"We went there right after lunch and were hoping to have some tea. Right after eating desserts, I was looking for something bitter like Chinese tea. So I had one of the tea. And my friend had a milk tea. But then we were told the store has a minimum purchase of $5. But none of the beverage is priced above $5. So we both have to order something else.   I ordered original millefeuille but was told they don't have it. So I took durian instead. There is so much cream in it. It's like eating a bowl of cream. My problem is that I hate cream so I had only one bite. My friend took a toast and that was ok.  Btw when I left, I saw a whole uncut original millefeuille sitting at the counter."}
{"text":"We four people had a pot of tea, 3 rice bowls, one salad, three small appetizers and two desserts. 26$ per person before tips.  We don't like the bubble tea here so we had a pot of green tea with passion fruit. We like the tea but would be happier if they don't charge extra 1$ each time refilling it with water.  Rice bowls we had are minced pork and mushrooms don. Minced pork was very good especially the egg in it.  Seaweed salad was tasty. The bing bread filled with beef or egg were good. Fried tofu was interesting and new to me.  There are many choices of desserts.  You can't go wrong with anything. Some friends of mine even drive all the way to get dessert here."}
{"text":"Good lunch for 9,99$ , nice place, good service, bubble tea, many dessert and more... I will probably come back for lunch again."}
