{"text":"This place has an amazing selection of beers and the taps are changing constantly. It is definitely a little pricey, but if you like to try different beers this is your place! The service was good and the atmosphere was very laid back. Definitely plan on going back to see what is new on tap."}
{"text":"Wow --- lots of beer selections! If you like beer choices, this is the place!  However, service was not so good on this Saturday Sept 3 late afternoon. With four people behind the bar and only a few customers in the place, service was slow and you must go to the bar and wait to be served. Maybe you need to know someone here to get waited on because some folks had great service? We paid cash earlier but the person helping us seemed to question that we had a tab --- a bit uncomfortable and sounded like we were trying to skip paying. Strange because so few in the place and this guy seemed to have no idea who we were though he was standing there when we ordered the first time.  Some customers had service at the table while others were ignored. Ordered a beer we thought we liked after paying $6.00 discovered it was terrible. Was charged full price for another to replace the beer with something else even though we did not drink the first beer. The guy had no comment and acted like we were just a problem adding to his workload, while a customer there actually expressed an appology for the beer issue.  I loved the second beer though. Ordered two chicken wraps. The wraps were VERY good but really small --- more like appetizers --- priced way high at $8.00 each for something this small. Overall, we may in the future return for a beer because this place is near us. I know not to expect service quality, know first to have tried the beer before ordering and eat before going.  Yes, we did leave good tips for each purchase so that is not the reason for the poor service. I'm not clear why a new place would not be more service focused.  I love that this place is here near us and really hope they improve the service and value associated with food prices.  Suggestion as a new business start up --- do something about the quality of service and value for the dollar. First impression opening is really important for building a customer base.  If the focus improves on our next visit --- I will update here.  I want this place to be successful."}
{"text":"We come here a couple times a month and love the beer selection! The staff always remembers us and makes us feel welcomed. We downloaded their app so we can always see what's on tap and make sure to head over when we see our favorites. The food is not good, so  don't come here hungry, but still giving it 5 stars because we love the place!"}
{"text":"Come try this place out! They have a lot to engage with and great attention to detail all around."}
{"text":"I love stouts and this place is heaven!  Love the atmosphere, variety on tap, take-home selection, friendly and knowledgeable servers."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to get craft beer. They always have updated lists on their apps and the people here are very knowledgeable. The atmosphere is very easy going and comfortable. Everyone is so friendly. Would definitly recommend."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beer.  Kinda weird that you have to order at the bar, but I don't totally hate it.  What I do hate is the ceiling fans on high (OMContacts) and the blinding halogen lighting (que migraine).  A nice concept, but the execution needs a few tweaks.  With a few mods, could do very well in this location."}
{"text":"Great place. I never knew this place existed. I am so happy that I found it. Lots of different beers at excellent prices. Usually when I fill up my growlers, it cost and attn and leg AND I get a half bottle of foam.  They know how to pour growlers.  Customer service was awesome. I'll be going back often!  If you want to learn about beer, then go here.   Ok. I stopped by again with the wife on her birthday. THEY HAVE BOARD GAMES!!!  I played my wife for over an hour on connect 4, battleship, and other games.  They found the greatest take home beers for us ...Via La Beaver is awesome and I wouldn't have every known it except for the Casual Pint!!"}
{"text":"Over priced. Pretentious. Lots of taps but no real variety. Confusing menu with more half pours that I have ever seen. Semi rude staff"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live just down the street and have seen this place driving by a few times. Last night we decided to give it a try. We were surprised that it wasn't busier considering football was on. We noticed the sign at the front door that said \"Service at the Bar\", which is a little odd to me for the way that the bar is set up. We ordered the pretzels with cheese and a pepperoni flatbread, both of them were good and we got our food really quick. There are a lot of beers on tap to try so we decided to order a flight of 6. I was surprised to find out though when I received the bill that the price for the flight was overpriced to me, I feel as if we should of just ordered pints. It also would have been nice if there was a paper list of the beer to look at, sitting at a table and having to turn around or even get up to be able to see the whole board. I also like to be able to read the description of beers, it gives me a better idea of whether I will like it or not. Overall, not a bad place just think there needs to be some improvements"}
{"text":"Decent selection - especially for chandler. Love the concept but not up to snuff with other beer joints or breweries. We stopped in on a Monday night - as other reviewers have pointed out there is no table service so take your spot in line at the bar. The bartender was clearly drunk - and continued to sample while we were there. Would prefer someone I could understand Vs. The slurred speech of a guy who should not be making recommendations."}
{"text":"Was number 4 in line on opening night.  I love the concept and have been to many taprooms across the U.S., but particularly in the northwest and west coast.  Great beer selection.  My suggestion is to categorize your beer selections by type (ie. Ale, IPA, stout, etc) on the board.!! I like that you are on untapped and that you proved alerts when you tap a new keg and add a new beer.  I would personally refrain from offering san tan or four peaks brew.  Nothing against them, but you can find them anywhere.  Would love to see more craft beers from micro and macro Brewers. There are some great Brewers in the Midwest and west coast like three floyds and many in Pennsylvania.  Glad you are in our area!!"}
{"text":"After skimming through the negative reviews that have been posted, I felt like it was necessary to add a rebuttal to give this place some credit.  I had a great time on my first visit, and am looking forward to the next.  The reverse happy hour is a great deal if you're looking to try new beers on tap.  The regulars providing excellent conversation (something I tend to avoid when going out) and went as far as to purchase some delicious refreshments for me (non-tap, but on the display in the front of the shop.)  It was a warm welcome to an unfamiliar environment.  The service was great, as well.  Two employees were constantly shuffling in and out of the back/bar area, taking note of when our drinks were almost finished and asking if we were ready to order another round.  I think some of the earlier reviews were just a temporary flop as they seem to have read and improved upon them -- something most businesses don't pay attention to.  So yeah, will definitely be looking forward to returning.  I feel like it's unfair to complain about the \"crowd\" the place attracts, as that shouldn't even be a concern especially if you are coming here with your own group.  If you don't connect or relate to someone at a bar, you simply avoid them.  Unless they're harassing you, it's completely out of your element to complain about such an issue that is out of your hands and the owner's hands.  Grow up.  The only negative is that the interior is fairly small and the beer selection takes up about 20-30% of the square footage of the building -- can't wait for the temps to drop and allow for the nice patio spread to give a bit of padding to the area.  I didn't mind the intimate setting of such a tight-fit interior but understand completely if some people find it a turn-off.  Go for it.  Especially for the reverse happy hour.  For the price, The Casual Pint can't be beat."}
{"text":"Cool, chill neighborhood spot. Excellent beer selection. Staff was extremely helpful and very friendly. Mostly craft beer oriented so small food selection but love the beers. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"I am a craft homebrewer and love this new hidden spot close to where we just moved.  Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the beers on tap.  I have been there a couple of times so far and have enjoyed the conversation with staff and other customers.  First time in, didn't realize that food was ordered at the bar, but Meghan (sp) was kind enough to come to the table and take the order.  She never mentioned that food was ordered at the bar, but we figured this out by the second time there.  Used to be a fan of AZ Wilderness until they got too good to talk to customers who are also homebrewers.  Can't wait to spend more time at our new favorite place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! First off I want to mention how I too of their website they are! They are always updating t with the new beers which I love! We've been there several times & will always go back! I love how many different selections they have in bottles & on tap there. There food is awesome, especially there HUMMUS! The staff is awesome there! I would highly recommend it! Only recommendation I would give is maybe an easier place to find location wise! Other than that we love it!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because of the staff.  They are knowledgeable and friendly.  I will have to say that this place is not for me.  Hipster, pretentious, stuffy are just a few words that I would use to describe this place.  The night we went, Friday night around 6:00, it was packed.  Just understand if you do go they have no alcohol, very limited wine selection (I think 4 different kind) and no soda.  We had a pregnant women with us and she asked for a Coke or Pepsi.  The waitress said that she \"might have a diet Pepsi in the refrigerator\" but they didn't have soda.  Seriously?  I would definitely change that.  Some of the people ordered food and they said that it was just ok at best. I also feel that this place is extremely pricey.  My wife and I had 4 (2 each) of the cheapest beers on the their menu and our bill was $25.  That is definitely pricey.  I understand that they only carry microbrews but for some reason the word \"microbrew\" and also been attached to expensive.  Maybe the greased handlebar mustache, dreadlock wearing, shined up penny loafer hipster doesn't mind paying $10 for a 5 oz beer, but the average Joe won't.  Chalk this up to been there done that."}
{"text":"A good selection of interesting beers and the beer-soaked brats were very good.  The food selection is very limited - go here to enjoy beer and not to eat.  They also have a huge selection of bottle beer for sale to go.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable (at least Dave, who was there when I went in!).  I would go again if I was in the neighborhood but wouldn't drive the 30 miles from my home to get there."}
{"text":"As others have stated it's a little tucked away and easy to miss. But once inside it is a treat. Very large selection of craft beers. Large selection on tap and even more on shelves and in coolers. Obviously you can get growlers filled as well. Prices are pretty reasonable.  We went with some out of town friends and had a very good time. I would recommend this little gem to everyone."}
{"text":"I finally got around to going to this place. They have an amazing selection of beer. They were super knowledgeable and helpful with tasting what they had on draft. The keg turnover is fast so if there is something you may get like then get some quick. We bought an assortment of canned and bottled beers/ciders along with a growler of beer. The atmosphere is very laid back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Was visiting from Tampa, Fl and stopped in.  Great selection of craft beers and the food was really good.  Very friendly staff who are knowledgeable about all the different beer styles!"}
{"text":"The experience overall was pretty good, just not happy about the bill.  My wife is not a big beer drinker, so she was happy to know they served wine.  Unfortunately, very expensive wine, $9 a glass.  The wine price was not posted anywhere and the bartender didn't happen to mention the price either.  When tabbing out, we had a bit of sticker shock at the wine price.  If a beer place is selling really expensive wine, they should communicate the price or keep then in line with normal beer prices."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and selection of beer.  I absolutely love the concept of having a beer market and the ability to select a beer and drink it there.  Bartender was not the warmest / nicest around but I'm hoping it was just a bad day for her.  I will definitely  be back!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for some beer and wine. Good service and enjoyed our flight selection we had. Can't wait to try the food next time. Definitely a spot you want to check out in this area.  Look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Good selection of craft brews and a knowledgeable set of bartenders to help you navigate them!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit here. Got to sample a few craft beers that aren't available at home in Ohio. Atmosphere was casual with an added bonus of live music, totally unexpected on a Wednesday night. The Mediterranean flatbread was excellent as was the service. We'll be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Love this place for a casual night checking out some new beers with my husband. Always great friendly people and a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I want to love this place!  I work around the corner and thought we had found a great new happy hour place. Unfortunately I was disappointed in a few things. The food could use some work. Wings are overly breaded and too soft. The sidewinder potatoes definitely have room for improvement. The flavors weren't great and the potatoes were mushy. Crispy potatoes would have made a marked improvement in the dish. The beer was good but the only menu was on the chalkboard inside or you could pull it up on the Untapped app. That was odd to me. Prices were actually fairly high from other local beer joints in the area. There are just better places in the area with better food and prices."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoy coming here to try new beers. The staff is almost always relatively friendly. We had a bad experience, though, coming in on a Sunday night and being rushed out the door at 7:20 pm - and their posted hours show they are open until 9. They stacked chairs all around us, \"last called\" the drinks, and ran our tab. We were enjoying our beers with friends and playing one of their board games... so that was irritating, will make me reconsider ever coming back."}
{"text":"Been here like 4 times now and like it a lot. The concept is very cool. I've never had bad service so maybe I'm a lucky one. The one Time I didn't sit at the bar I did get service at my table. The selection is pretty good. I doubt they do a paper beer list since the tap beers often. Being on untapped is a plus too. Some misters on patio would be nice along with a tv."}
{"text":"Great place to sit and have a drink or get a bottle to go. They have a great tap selection, a good can/bottle selection, and very good service. I haven't tried the food yet but I will sometime soon. My only complaint would be that for some reason a few cans/bottles are a little overpriced. This only applies to a few beers that I've seen, as most are priced normally, but I did find a few much cheaper at other locations."}
{"text":"I enjoy exploring and tasting the variety of craft beers available.  Finding places which have a nice selection and keep the selection fresh by rotating different breweries beer through is nice. The Casual Pint is a great place to find that variety.  They typically have 30 different types on tap plus I have not counted how many bottled types they have.  They keep their draft beers fresh by rotating new varieties in every week.  The prices are reasonable for a six flight taste. Servers are very knowledgeable and patient while you decide or if you have questions.   The setting is very casual.  Fridays can be crowded but not so bad you cannot find a seat.  They have a patio and a large area for bicycle parking. Inside they have open seating, a variety of board and card games and general music.  Food wise, they have some basic snacks like soft pretzels,  flat bread pizza and chips and salsa.  I like the atmosphere.  You can definitely unwind from a long day."}
{"text":"Great beers, even better people! Has a local hangout feel, defiantly the after work place for a drink (if you like brews) the food menu is short and sweet just some munchies while you're enjoying your liquid carbs and calories, definitely worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"AMAZING beer selection!  Great atmosphere.  Did I say AMAZING beer selection?  Knowledgeable staff, great patio.  Definitely a place to try it you love craft beer."}
{"text":"Food's good, beer selection is great, staff is knowledgeable and pleasant. \"Carryout\" portion has a great selection and good \"bulk discount\" deal (which I have yet to take advantage of, but will certainly do so if I ever graduate to full-blown Alcoholic). Gets a little crowded and noisy indoors; patio is more mellow, if that's your thing.  Parking sucks, though.  Be prepared to walk across half the lot if it's ...y'know ...the witching hour."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection....  So sad Service is horrible you have to go up to the bar to order even though there are 4 employees working..  one tending bar the other three are just standing around bartender is only concerned about people sitting at the bar. Both tables next to us sat here for about ten mins just like us waiting for help then walked up to the bar only to wait another ten mins to be helped. I will say it is their first week I truly hope they get things together cause I can't see it stay in business at this rate. So very sad we were so excited a place with a great craft beer selection. We will give it about a month and try it one more time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.   Large selection of beers.  Personally I am not a big beer fan but they do have wine, but only one red and one white and they aren't that good.  That being said, wine isn't served in a \"pint\" so it is obviously not aimed toward the wine crowd."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of both local and regional beers from accords the country. Awesome staff and attentive service. A great place to unwind and relax, drive a great beer and enjoy snacks."}
{"text":"What a great place to enjoy a beer! Great selection of beers, also a huge take out selection. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, very helpful too. I recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"I've been in here twice to have a pint and fill a growler on a Friday afternoon, and as much as I want to give them a good rating, I'm holding back. Customer service skills are near 'zero' (not even a thank you), and a feeling that you're imposing on their space. I won't be back for quite a while, I'm sorry to say. 8/13/17 Update: After the owner/manager's response, which I really appreciate, I will be back soon for another try!"}
{"text":"This place does what it says no drama! I took my wife out for a drink and decided to give casual pint a shot. The place is really quaint, no loud music, no glaring shimmers.The server was really helpful and he helped us narrow down on a drink from the impressive selection of beers. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"We have been waiting to find a place like this. Super chill and an amazing variety on tap. Love that it has board games and music that isn't crazy loud."}
{"text":"First off... I really want to love this place.  My only issue at all is that while the selection of beers on draft is very impressive, there are very few that can actually be filled in a growler.  It's torture!  The food options are limited, however the Happy Hour prices are good and it does the trick.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Overall its a fun place, but too often I leave and get a growler from the local gas station."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday before things got busy. Sat at a table a while before seeing the small print at the top of the chalkboard about ordering at the bar. The bar was full, so you end up squeezing between people and apologizing for disrupting them while trying gain the attention of one of the five people behind the bar. Really odd set up... The beer selection is great, both tap and canned/bottled. The place is a dead ringer for a place in Boise called Bier Thirty. Same concept, but far better service. Bier Thirty is still there years later; this place won't make it a year at this rate. They have too many employees and can't run a decent volume through, due to their system. Major bummer, because I really want a local place like this make it."}
{"text":"One of the best beer lists in the east valley. Great rotation, uber-friendly & knowledgeable staff, and Team Trivia on Tuesdays to boot.  The food here is pretty standard pub grub, but I will call out the pepperoni flatbread as my favorite item on the menu - it is appropriately cheesy and pairs well with any beer choice."}
{"text":"I will  be back. The food was decent. Service was amazing. Beer....yeah....fantastic. Great options and incredibly knowledgeable staff. I will be back...often."}
{"text":"This place just opened, when we walked in I noticed all the beer available for purchase-great selection. I think the place could definitely use some shutters-heat. Great draft selection!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing beer selection! Also, great patio perfect for a relaxing afternoon or evening pint."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last weekend while we were exploring the area. It's too far from where we live to thoroughly enjoy, but the bar tenders were friendly and helpful, and the beer selection was plentiful and easy to understand. There were a gathering of regulars, which I love. If I were closer I'd stop in more often."}
{"text":"INVISIBLE. I agree on the amazing selection.  Very cool concept. Was there for my first time tonight with hubby and left without ordering. Why? We came in and sat down at the bar. Literally everyone around me was being waited on. A couple came in after us and guess what? They received their beers and paid for them in the same amount of time that we just sat there. Invisible. Usually one can become invisible are a table, but at the bar? Unacceptable by anyone's standards. There are 4 people behind the bar and NOT ONE asked to help us. Done. End of story.  We are now at Zipps. Getting amazing service as usual."}
{"text":"I'm offended.  I was there early, got a TV tuned to the Texas game.  Halfway thru 2nd quarter, they changed EVERY TV to the NFL.  I asked it to be changed back to my game.  I was told a lot of people at the bar, who came in after me, asked for NFL even though one of two was already on NFL....that they would turn a TV \"in the corner\" to my game and they would move me.  I think this was very rude to me and they wasted virtually 1/2 the 2nd quarter just to change the corner TV back.  If they want to watch the NFL with National Football LOSERS...they're welcome to it...but I\"m not going back. Table service is \"iffy\".  Food, I don't know cuz they took my order just before they change the Tx game...and I left shortly afterward.  IF they want to support the millionaires who disrespect our country and the sacrifices made by so many..they're on their own..  I\"m OUT."}
{"text":"If I was a local, I would be a regular here.  Their tap list is amazingly varied with great beers on rotating taps. Their staff is helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. Their menu is stocked with delicious pub food. Their bottle and can selection is also very extensive. I personally loved that they have board games available and live music on Thursday nights. Overall, a chill place to kick it with amazing beer.  Wish I had a place like this back home."}
{"text":"I made my second visit to the casual pint on April 7th. I tried another \"beer joint\" earlier in the day and had a mediocre experience. While casual pint was having a fundraiser and was crowded, we still had great service and an enjoyable experience. The selection didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Opening night was packed. But on the plus side I got a free growler. Great beer selection. Great coffee shop enviroment, opposed to the usual bar enviroment. Great if you want to grab some single bottles or a six pack to take home too."}
{"text":"Could be a five star, but not on one visit. They know there beers, and have a good selection. The mango habanero wings are cooked just right with the correct amount of heat. Very good staff. No issues with the prices. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good beer selection on draft.  The bottled and canned area isn't too impressive for a bottleshop.  Prices are a bit on the high side but the quality of beers available justifies that somewhat.    The interior setup lacks comfort save for the 4 soft chairs in the corner.  The location is tucked away and easy to miss.    Overall, if you love beer and want some good variety, this is a nice spot to swing by and pick up a growler or have a pint."}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time for the great selection of beers and amazing pretzels with beer cheese. Recently, however, the service has gone downhill. Bartenders are aggressive and rude. I'd be surprised if they're still open in a few months time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my family for a beer and some food and was really glad I did. It's hard to find a place that really knows its beer but is also kid friendly. I enjoyed a great craft beer while the kids played shuffle board and board games - they have a whole bookshelf of them.   Everyone found something to eat on the menu and based on there not being a crumb left, my kids really liked the pizza. I went for the Thai Chicken flatbread but at the last minute asked if they could turn it into a wrap for me as I hadn't eaten veggies in awhile. They were super accommodating and it tasted delicious - the chicken was obviously fresh and cooked in house. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening last night and had a great time! They have a wonderful selection of beer on tap and bottled/canned on shelves like a market. You will find some beers here you won't be able to find much elsewhere in AZ, including one of my favs, Mother Earth Cali Creamin'. They also sell the usual merch and growlers. I really like the cafe feel to this place, between the outdoor patio and the indoor setup with comfortable seating. The staff was also very friendly even with the chaos of their opening night -- very impressive.  My only reason this isn't 5 stars is that they do run pricey. While they are close by and thus convenient, some of their beers on tap are $10 for a pint. All in all, I will definitely be coming back as its close to home and seems to have a great crowd and great staff running the place. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fun place to come relax, enjoy a few beers and even have some light food. Bartenders are super friendly and they have tons of different beers to try! Very light atmosphere and would be a perfect place to take someone for a first date."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of brews! Friendly staff and helpful to make recommendations! Average food options but it's fresh and made well!"}
{"text":"Great beer, food and atmosphere. Staff and owners are awesome. Beer selection is awesome. I strongly suggest coming. Best thing is they have a dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I love the variety of beer. I've found beer that I haven't been able to locate in the state of AZ. You can by a single can and mix it with others, order a growler to fill, or enjoy a pint. Like other breweries and tap rooms, service is at the bar, this makes sense for such a small establishment. The patio can be bright in the afternoon but I was able to see the prettiest sunset while drinking a delicious pint of craft beer, pure heaven! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty sweet! We arrived and it was a full house so we went outside. They definitely need to work on the patio metal chairs no cushions is no Bueno. I would also recommend getting some music outside but in that area my Chandler snob neighbors would probably protest. All in all we enjoyed it very much! The old board games in the corner is awesome and yes you can watch sports too. We will definitely return with growlers in tow. Z"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to hang out with a pint or two. Good selection of beer on tap, plenty of seats at the bar, in the room, and even on the patio. More impressive than the taplist is the bottle selection, both shelved and in the cooler. I usually pick up a mixed six pack (30% off) and they have a nice, wide selection. This is just a little further than I normally care to drive, so I don't go often. If I lived closer this would be my regular spot."}
{"text":"We have really enjoyed the casual atmosphere and the ability to sample new beers. Nice, mellow atmosphere.  Love the pretzels and beer cheese too!"}
{"text":"I went to the Casual Pint and was so excited to find their amazing beer selection, definitely something for every beer preference. The staff was friendly and knew their beer, and one of the more relaxing patios. I will be visiting again for sure."}
{"text":"Went to the Casual Pint yesterday where I met a friend for drinks. This place is pretty cool. It's kind of hidden from the road, so you have to keep an eye out for it. The Casual Pint host 30 different types of beer on tap and you can also buy bottled beer and growlers there too. Mix and match with their six pack carriers. The beer on tap changes regularly, so you have an opportunity to try different craft beers. Nice atmosphere and very clean inside and out side. There is a patio area outside to drink. Good service, friendly staff and yes, it gets busy. I didn't have the food so I cannot comment on it."}
{"text":"2nd visit in 2 days. Great selection, 31 beers on tap plus an impressive can and bottle selection to go. The beers span the US but emphasize regional craft brews. Discovered my new favorite IPA!  The service here is much, much better than I'm used to experiencing at craft brew pubs. The staff is extremely friendly. No condescension! It's packed today and every bartender  (4 here today) has talked to me and asked how they can help. The moment a pint goes dry, these guys are there to get you another or close you out.   Very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Nice concept, poor execution. Lots of beer selection, very limited variety unless you prefer IPA. Bar staff has little to no personality. Don't go for the food that's for sure. Will not return and don't hold out much hope that they will survive too much longer without some positive changes. I wish you luck!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars for its beer selection, good staff and casual/not noisy inside and patio area. Similar to the many tap rooms in Denver, where I lived, there is zero on the menu for non drinking patrons. I don't understand not having soda or ice tea or something. Also the menu has zero to offer that doesn't have carbs or gluten. While sn establishment does not have to be everything to everybody, it makes it easier for all to enjoy if theres a minimal selection for everyone. While I'd go back for the atmosphere, I won't be able to because of the drink and food menu."}
{"text":"Not a brewery, but everything is available. Staff is cool and attentive. I am happy, and that's all I need,"}
{"text":"Great hang out and great beer selection! We enjoyed the patio during the cooler fall weather with the heaters on beside us. The menu is huge, and the staff is all too excited to help you pick out the perfect brew for your taste buds. I lucked out on the night that was being sponsored by La Cumbre and got some schwag and a great beer cup!   They also have a section of 6 packs and other unique beers for sale by the door so you can stock up on some of your other, harder to find favorites. Being a Fort Collins gal, I was excited to find O'dell Brewing's Eugene Chocolate Milk Stout. I could definitely hang out here more often."}
{"text":"Great ambience, wide selection of beers and decent collection of board games for you to try. Not super loud so you can actually have a conversation with the people around you.   I LOVE the Pretzels here! An order comes with 3 and is served with their beer cheese. Sometimes it's a little salty but if you scrape it off you're golden. The texture of the pretzel is perfect - such and warm and goes so well with the cheese.   I also recommend getting their . I usually order the 'Casual Like' which comes with pulled pork!  They also have Trivia on Tuesday nights at 7pm!   **TLDR: quiet, has board games, lots of beer, delicious pretzels"}
{"text":"Love the concept - a causal craft beer spot with to go craft beer. Excellent tap list. It's definitely family friendly which is a huge plus.   However here are some suggestions: - have a printed beer list. We asked what types of beers were which and the waitress suggested we go on Untapped. :-|  - the tap list on the wall has confusing abbreviations. If you didn't know the brewery or beer you were ordering, it could be confusing. Example: they have Goose Island Ogden, but it's abbreviated as \"Goose Is Ogden.\" If you didn't know the brewery Goose Island it could be kinda odd ordering. They also abbreviated Borderlands as BL, there's no way of knowing what BL is.  - food ordering could be better. I didn't order food but I heard it was overpriced and nothing exceptional.  - there's so many TVs but perhaps if they used one of those electronic tap lists like at Taste of Tops, it would be better use of TVs. - can you bring your own food? I don't know, they didn't say either way.  But I like the concept and I live close to here so I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came in for afternoon beers. Service was great, beer was good too. Awesome selection of both draft and bottled/canned. This neighborhood needed a good tap room."}
{"text":"A man's man is a man, who, according to other men, is the archetype of manliness. Like if the attributes of a man resulted from consensus voting of other men, the man's man would be the result. Granted, what that man would look like is likely to vary greatly as the consensus changed. A man's man back before writing - Gorp we'll call him - invented fire, was a champion wrestler, and could bring down a mammoth with a single spear throw. A man's man in Ancient Greece - Archuncules perhaps - would be an champion Olympian at times of peace and a fearsome hoplite at war, a compelling speaker in the forum, and could give it (and take it) like a champ. See? Norms change.  The quality of a man's man today may be debated, but one thing is certain, he knows and likes his beer. I don't know why, or where this stereotype comes from, but it's a verifiable, bona fide fact. Exhibit 1: Dos Equis commercials. Liking beer? Not enough. To be a modern man's man, encyclopedic knowledge is not enough. You ever read an encyclopedia? The articles are like, a page. Wikipedia level knowledge of beer components, flavor profiles, history and brewing techniques is the base level required for the modern man's man.  This level of knowledge and devotion to beer is not attainable for the average dude (for the man's man is no average single-tattoo sleeve bearded bro), but the Casual Pint is a place where the average dude can fake it. He can saunter in, look at the expansive menu, and say, \"how 'bout a pint of the Castrated Elk\" or \"only the froth of the Soggy Butler will grace this upper lip.\"  The bartender will smile and nod. The pint will be served. Masculinity won't be attained, but the average bro will feel a peace wash over his soul, his crippling insecurity vanquished, or at least put to rest. He'll glance at the steins in the corner and feel comfort, as the gurgle of the tap harmonizes with the soft clink of a glass. Like Gorp coming across a bubbling brook after the hunt, or Archuncules spooning his young squire, thanks to the Casual Pint, Peter can flex his pecs, order a Flaming Mulefart, and relax."}
{"text":"Okay. Best dam pub in south Chandler!  Beer selection is amazing!  If its not on tap they have a large selection of cold beers from all over the place!  Food -  had the hummus plate. Could have had more carrots and celery. Seemed a bit short!!!  Chips salsa guac was a large portion!  Brat was tasty!!!  Wings were good also - Service was great!  Overall weird place for a  pub but its about time!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place, and had a lot of beer to choose from, but I disliked quite a few that I sampled. A little expensive when the beer doesn't match my taste."}
{"text":"In town and spotted this place as was looking for a place to chill for a bit and try some new beers.  The have flights of 4 or 6 beers so can try a wide selection quickly.  Was pleasantly surprised on the size and openness of the establishment, they have a great bar area with tables and an outdoor patio which will be great in the evening.   The beer selection was great and was told they rotate what is on tap on a regular basis... the really cool thing I have not seen at other Beer pubs is a huge selection of craft brews to go both dry shelves and a cooler section which greatly expands the beers you can have while there or decide to take home for enjoyment later.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and offered so great recommendations based upon what I thought I wanted and a few \"you might like this\" which made it even more fun.  They also have a couple selections of growlers if you just need to take some extra home"}
{"text":"Decent new place but they don't have their concept figured out yet.  Arrogant bar tender was a surprise for a new place trying to establish themselves in a saturated market.  Food was decent.  Service was fair at best.  Glass was empty too long at the bar."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe! Great place to try different beer and hangout with friends. Maybe even watch a game."}
{"text":"Brand new beer bar opened up in Ocotillo, SW corner of Queen Creek and Alma School, attached to Keegan's on the West side.  30 taps, wide variety of craft beers. You can also pick from their bottle selection and even take bottles. Very chill place, nice bar, friendly bartenders."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week and it was fantastic. A little small inside so if it was busy I imagine it would be tough to find a spot, but we had no problem on a Friday at 7.  As many others have mentioned, they have a nice selection of unique craft beers on tap and even more in the fridge where you can do your typical pick 6. The food selection is limited, but that's not what this place is necessarily about. You go here for a drink and a small snack on the side. We did try the pretzels and beer cheese though and it was amazing, probably the best beer cheese I have had.  The environment is very laid back and the service was great. We were constantly being checked on to make sure we had everything we need, even chatting it up with a few servers. It was exactly the place we wanted to be for a cold beer and some relaxation at the end of a week. I cannot wait to come back here!   If you are looking for a more relaxed place to enjoy a beer and maybe pick up a 6 pack on your way out, this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"The beer was excellent, but when the service is so horrendous that you have to create a yelp to write a review, one star is warranted. Wow, where do I begin. Our \"waitress\" Montana spent the evening drinking, sitting with other patrons, and cracking disgustingly vulgar and sexual jokes. She made me feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. I could hear her laughing and making fun of other customers as well. Stay away females. And stay away respectful men."}
