{"text":"Very good Italian restaurant -- the baked ziti and chicken parm hero are both terrific.  Garlic bread and meatballs are tasty.  Staff is always pleasant and responsive, and they do both dine-in and delivery.  You can also call in your order and pick it up so you don't have to wait.  Plain and ordinary in terms of atmosphere and surroundings, but reasonably priced Italian food and a really varied menu.  I like take out better than eating there and the salads aren't great, but otherwise really good place, and excellent hours."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent, but the staff is horrendous. Absolutely zero customer service and it feels like they think they are doing you a favor!    We came in and ordered two 14\" pizzas (~$30). They took 30 min to get the first one out and then another 10 to get the second one out. When I inquired what was taking so long, the woman at the register told me \"we were really busy tonight\". That was odd since we were the only people in the dining room. When she brought the second pizza she didn't say a word. No apology, no attempt to make the experience better.   I will never go to Mama's Pizza in Cornelius, NC again. Do yourself a favor and pass this place over for a place that will appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Two of my co workers and I came here for lunch, two of us ordered the lunch special. This was a sub choice, salad and pizza slice cheese or pepperoni. Pizza came out first, lots of grease for my tastings. The Big Mamma Sub was lukewarm, the mozzarella was still in cold sliced form. We never received the salad. When asked, we made a deal to substitute for another slice of pizza. We had only the choice of cheese offered. No apologies were ever mentioned. I'm sure a lot of people may enjoy the food but I am not likely to return to this location."}
{"text":"Totally by chance while driving, I came to a stop behind a MAMA's PIZZA EXPRESS delivery vehicle.  WHOA! - - - - I was in the market for an Italian pizza restaurant who offered delivery; NOT A NATIONAL CHAIN.  Hmmmm ... perhaps I happened upon a winner???  A few hours later after confirming an italian dinner was good for my household, I phoned MAMA's & spoke w/ an order taker who actually knew their menu & his job very well.  After the O.T. fielded a few questions & in turn offered a few good suggestions I placed my 1st order for Chicken Parmigiana, Double Baked Lasagna/Meat and Mama's Salad.  Delivery actually arrived a bit earlier than advised;  HOT & EARLY.  I tipped him a couple bucks more than I originally planned.  I quickly served the food on plates w/ silverware & drinks ... COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE 1ST TASTE.  The salad was tasty but average.  My meat Lasagna was fresh and I enjoyed it.  As far as the Chicken Parmigiana my household rated it average ... nothing special.  Portion size is average.  Will order the D.B. Lasagna/Meat & another menu entr√©e again from MAMA's PIZZA EXPRESS.  Hoping to please everyone in my house.  Thanks for the FREE DELIVERY W/ $25 ORDER AND PERSONABLE EXPERIENCED STAFF! * * * 3 1/2 Stars"}
{"text":"This place is very close to our business, but we never tried it before. So we finally decided to give it a try last Sunday night.  We walked into the place and were greeted by no one. After about 60 seconds looking at each other, about 3 people showed up from the back and asked us for our order. We ordered Mama's Special pizza with pepperoni, prosciutto ham, garlic, and basil.  The crust was OK, but it could be cooked for 2-3 more minutes. I agree with another reviewer, the overall taste was quite bland. After tasting all the individual indigents we found out the cheese was the culprit. It was very oily, yellow glue like substance with absolutely no flavor.  We were the only customers in the restaurant but got absolutely no service. Yet, you are required to pay and tip when ordering your food. Do you see a pattern here?  To sum it up, I cannot give this place more than 2 stars. My suggestions are:  1) Hire someone who worked in restaurant business before and understands a little bit about customer service. 2) Pay and tip at the end of the meal. 3) Stop using yellow glue cheese like substance. 4) Start using fresh garlic. 5) Cook your pies until they are properly done.

{"text":"Decent Italian food. Love their pasta Vodka. Meatballs are very good as well. We typically order for pickup."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that finding good pizza in Davidson/Cornelius is difficult, maybe because it just doesn't exist. So it isn't all too surprising that I've been disappointed by yet another pizza place.   We ordered a spinach, mushroom, tomato, pepperoni pizza for delivery.  They quoted us an hour for delivery.  The pizza actually arrived before that time but was already getting cold.  As for the pizza itself, the crust is pretty decent, however they use low quality ingredients and the sauce (what there was of it) was bland and in need of some serious addition of spices.  The mushrooms they used are canned, the spinach was frozen and the diced tomato's were not ripe.  Over-all, it could really be a decent pie if they just upgraded their ingredients, but maybe because the competition is so low, they feel that they don't need to.  Until then, the quest will continue....."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic, and the service is even better. They were so nice and patient with us and if you want service with a smile. This is your place!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and always accommodating.  You should go for the food. Very large selection of deli and pizza selections.  The sit down area leaves much to be desire.  Booths and all well broken in and it is very dingy.  Just now inviting. But the food offerings are excellent and we have always enjoyed the food TO GO."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. NY/New England style...amazed to find pizza like this in NC. I'd order this back home."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a 14\" Hawaiian. Above average pizza, and good service, but the counter employee didn't smile much. I gave 4 stars because it was 17.99$, which I thought was a little high. I would come back though."}
{"text":"$9 Mediterranean salad was nothing more than white Iceberg lettuce with three peppers, a sprinkle of Feta, and some olives.  Their $19 Chicken Parmesan Pizza was tasteless and full of grease and salt.  So disappointing:("}
{"text":"Best pizza in North Carolina, fast and friendly service. They have many other items on their menu, the meatball sub is delicious."}
{"text":"Everybody seems to have an opinion about what is 'real' pizza is and what isn't. Pizza varies greatly by regions and most tend to like what they grew up with. That being said, I agree with many of the reviews here that say that the sauce is bland and too thin and that the cheese is greasy and lacks flavor. This restaurant is right near where I live and I have tried various Items on the menu: sandwiches, pasta and pizza. The sandwiches are stacked with excellent ingredients and the recipes are also good in concept, but the bread? No thanks. Why not traditional Italian rolls for Italian-style subs? Whats with the seeds? I also have found the bread to be generally too dry and crusty. With such excellent ingredients within the sandwich it's a shame that the bread upstages it all and not in a good way. As for the pasta? Same as with the pizza. Bland.  I don't think this is bad food. It seems that it is more a case of regional differences. Judging by the previous comments, it would appear that if you are from the NYC region there is a good chance you will like the characteristics of the pies and the pastas. I personally prefer a richer, more seasoned sauce and real, Italian bread! As a side note: I'm from Chicago and one thing's for sure. Chicagoans and New Yorkers have never agreed on how a pizza should be made, yet both are loved depending on where you are from. I felt compelled to give this 2 stars but in fairness, I give it 3 because I think the ingredients are good quality and it's in my opinion, more an issue of personal preference. Give it a try. You might just love it!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Just moved to CLT area, and had both take out and ate here late one evening just before closing.   Staff has helpful and fun.   They have a great family special with pizza, pasta, bread, and it fed my whole family with leftovers.   Definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I got Mama's on my way home from a haircut in Cornelius on Thursday last week.  We got:  Pepperoni Pizza, Garden Salad, Garlic Knots.  The pizza was GREAT!  Very tasty!  Warmed up great too!  Garden saled was not work $4.  It was lettuce, 3 wedges of tomato, and a tiny bit of onion (i asked for no black olives).  Ranch dressing wasn't good at all.  Garlic knots were pretty good.  Again, the pizza we had was great."}
{"text":"Exceptional! You would be hard pressed to find better pizza anywhere. We got the 18 inch garlic lovers delight and it was the bomb! Perfect crust- cheesy- awesome flavor from the first bite to the last! Awesome and friendly staff! Clean restrooms and seating area and here is the kicker- no wifi! They want you to put down your phones and relate to each other at the table face to face and I love that concept! Great place for subs and other sandwiches and their prices are cheap! This is a no brained you guys! Decent parking and open every day! Get your pizza fix on!!!!"}
{"text":"Congrats! You stole my money! We got the Sicilian special. Not sure what was special about it though. My guess is they call it \"special\" because they make a special trip across the street to the grocery store, buy a frozen pizza, cook it and sell it for $20. The crust sucks, tastes like cardboard, toppings were cold. It's like they cook a cheese pizza and then place cold toppings on top of it. I'm highly disappointed in this place, do not eat here. We I'll never eat here again, and will be telling others not to either. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this pizza is forever emblazoned in my brain as the best pizza ever. All others will be judged by this slice. It's like seven majestic unicorns prancing on your taste buds. Seriously, I die."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews while waiting for my order and decided to put other opinions aside and unbiasedly sample items from the menu. My wife ordered the family platter which included baked ziti, a meatball sub and pepperoni pizza. We added a salad to make us feel better about our massive carb load we were about to partake in.   The restaurant was a typical mom n pop pizza joint with a rather expansive menu. While it felt comfortable in the dinning room, many of the tables were dirty. We found a clean one on our fourth attempt. They were also small. Who cares about a small table?? Well, pizza eating becomes a challenge when a pie takes up half the table.   The salad came first. It was average. A small quantity of black olives came on the side of simple iceberg, scant red onions and a couple of cherry tomatoes. It was fresh produce however nothing memorable. Minutes later, the entrees followed. The meatball sub was a nice portion. The bread was soft inside but had a nice crunch that accompanied the four oversized meatballs inside.  Even though the marinara sauce tasted industrial, the savory flavor of the meatballs carried the day putting the sub in the 'well done' category.   The baked ziti also used that same sauce. The problem was there was no ingredient to bail it out.  The pasta was undercooked, even by authentic Italian standards and it lacked flavor. One word describes the dish: Chef Bogarde.  The pizza came last. It looked great. Tasted great too. It had that New York pie texture and taste. Cooked well, nice flavor (although you can't mess up pepperoni), and a good balance between sauce and cheese.    We paid approx. $25 for this meal for a family of four. Perhaps if they paired down the menu and focus on pizza, they would be a 4.5 star establishment."}
{"text":"Usually order take out from Mama's Pizza Express. Here is my review for this establishment.  If you are looking for pizza similar to the ones they make in NYC, this is the place to go. Ordered a sausage pizza pie every time I am in the neighborhood. Have ordered slice to go once in a while when I get the urge for a slice. The Stromboli are a little greasy but filled with sausage and cheese. Definitely go for the Cannoli's- to get that sugar fix.  Staff is friendly and it's like the neighborhood pizzeria in Cornelius. Gets busy on the during lunch, evenings and on the weekends."}
{"text":"It's amazing what a person with an attitude will do to destroy a dining experience  Having to do downgrade my overall impression and review of this place.  Food is still good and prices are reasonable but after a long day, I don't have to put up with someone taking my order with an attitude, a serious attitude.  Walked in and were asked what we wanted in a very polite manner. My wife said, give us a minute. Asked again and I made my choice and my wife then gave here order. They then again asked me what I wanted despite the fact that I ordered first.   On and on and in the end they gave us a total which was obvious, did not include our drink orders.  Next to useless in term of service. The food was still good but the person at the counter did not make for a plesant experiece and it will be awhile before I go back. Maybe in that time, they will get someone in that critical position who cares about the customers."}
{"text":"Plenty of toppings on the small veggie lover pizza, black olives all over the place.  The meat lovers was large and had some barren patches so I could do with a bit more toppings.  As for the cheese - it has good flavor but you don't get a very thick layer of cheese.  This is good pizza but not great.  I would eat here again but this won't be my go to place for pizza in this area."}
{"text":"I order from here frequently. It's good. Not just good enough but actually good. The employees are all very kind which adds to wanting to come back. Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hate when I feel compelled to write a bad review....but...  Counter staff was nice...no complaints there, but in the end, it's the food that counts. That's where they fell WAY short. Ordered a meatball sub. Maybe I'm spoiled having lived in Chicago for many years, but this was terrible.  The right (and wrong) way to do a meatball sub:  1. Use an Italian roll, not a loaf of sesame bread 2. Slightly butter and toast it on the grill, not just plain, crusty dry bread 3. Don't skimp on the meatballs - a 12 inch sub (as this was) should have 6 meatballs (especially when smaller), not a chincy 4 with an inch of dead space in between and on the ends. Yours is a bread sandwich with a little meat thrown in. 4. Make sure there is PLENTY of sauce. Mine was so dry, I literally had to microwave spaghetti sauce at home and add it. I have had MANY meatball subs in my life, and I've never felt it necessary to do this. It was like they wiped the meatballs off before dropping them on the dry bread.  C'mon Mama's...just because this isn't Chicago or NY, there's no excuse for such a bad, basic menu item like a meatball sub!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in lake Norman. I'm not a big fan of chain pizzerias so when this opened up, I was excited to try it out. Since then I haven't gone anywhere else for pizza."}
{"text":"We have ordered takeout 3 times in 2 weeks. Each time we turned down every takeout restaurant in Mooresville, Davidson and the Cornelius area to eat here.   I am not comparing this restaurant against five star Italian restaurants. That's not what mamas is about, though they could compete. Mama's delivers some of the best Italian comfort food around at a reasonable price.  We typically order a cheese pie & spaghetti & meatballs. They have not disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while.  I have been to the Huntersville location and had their 2 slices and a drink for $5 deal.  It was decent pizza.....So I tried it last night.  I should have passed.    I can confirm Bill W.'s review, not sure why the workers feel the need to be rude.  Holy crap, the guy cooking the pizza had a bad attitude.  I posted pics of the family meal.  Cheese Pizza and Buffalo Chicken Pizza - these were okay, maybe a 5 or 6 out of 10.  Nothing special.   For the price I paid, I would have thought they should have been a 10.  The cheese pizza was overcooked and half was burned, if you are a pizza cook - learn your oven and figure out where the hot spots are, amateurish to say the least.  Chicken Marsala - noodles not cooked, chicken was soggy (see pic), masala sauce was soup at the bottom of the container.    Chicken Parm - noodles not cooked, chicken and sauce tasted fine.  Overall - $65 dropped and we had water.   This was a depressing Fathers Day dinner........"}
{"text":"I should start by saying that I LOVE Mama's Pizza in Huntersville. It is REAL pizza in NC. We used to live near that location then moved to Davidson and drive there for our pizzas still, until now since the Cornelius location is open! The Huntersville location is very neat and clean.  This location is situation in the La Spada's (old Philly Cheesesteak Restaurant) on Old Statesville Road. We went there once before. We never went back because even though the food was good the venue was kinda gross, flies everywhere outside, musty smell in the restaurant area and terrible ambiance outside and inside in general.   We were very excited for the grand opening, so we went there on the first day. They were hard at work making their great food. But still getting some kinks out with service, which is to be expected. But, some of the things that we didn't like about La Spada's still existed as Momma's. We were looking forward to seeing an upfitted dining room but it was still musty and as soon as you walk in on the left there is a large furnace mechanical that has not been covered. My husband commented that while sitting in the restaurant, he felt like he was at camp. I have to agree with that opinion.    So, while the food is amazing, I highly recommend the Gramma's PIzza! I need to give this restaurant a 4 rating based on the eating areas. This will not stop me from patronizing this restaurant, but I will never plan on eating inside or on patio area, unless things are upfitted. I also am hoping they include their Italian Market at this location as well. I really love that they have that in Huntersville and would love to buy my Italian Food there.  I know this isn't the best review on the actual venue. but please keep in mind that the food is AWESOME and I TOTALLY recommend takeout. Thanks Momma's!"}
{"text":"Ate outside and shared a large veggie specialty pizza. Crust was good but I've had better toppings. Spinach was frozen not fresh and mushrooms canned not fresh. Whyyyy!? Also they put broccoli on which I find to be a strange topping."}
{"text":"Wings are decent but nothing extraordinary.  My fellow eating enthusiasts wanted garlic and wouldn't surrender to having true wings with hot sauce.  You certainly couldn't call these wings Buffalo wings since they were breaded like Hooters.  The pizza is completely satisfactory but not as good as Tony's.  The toppings are reasonable but I didn't get that taste I crave from the cheese or the sauce.  The last three times I had pizza from here all the toppings cascade off the pizza.  I go here because the location is very convenient.  I will try and review again after having a non-pizza item and some real wings."}
{"text":"So I had a meeting in Cornelius yesterday and had the absolute pleasure of eating the amazing food catered by Momma's!   Wow- let me say this reminded me of the awesome Italian food in my home state of NY. I just wish it were closer to Charlotte - but I will definitely be making the trip back here when I am home sick!   The lowdown on the spread:  Antipasto:  chock full of Boars Head meats and cheeses- served with excellent home-made dressing ....deeeelicious!   Baked Ziti: Good- not the best ive ever had but still yummy.  Penne Alla Vodka: This is a dish I make awesome home-made and still haven't found one to compete- it was good- not great.   Chicken Parm: SOOOO good! They nailed this one. Their sauce is incredible  Pizza- Wow! One of the best pizza's Ive had in NC. I could literally taste the basil- it had a great homemade quality to it.   Cheesecake- Perfect. I split this with my co-worker but seriously considered going back for more. NY style all the way!   So if you find yourself in Cornelius - go! Even if you aren't that way this is totally worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Yeah. I love pizza. A LOT. Always on the look out for new pizza to try. So I got excited by the mostly good reviews for this place because it's close to where I'm staying here.   Unfortunately I have to assume that my idea of great 4 or 5 star pizza is very different from the other reviewers. To my sisters and I this pizza was not very good at all. It was edible but that's about all. The flavor is virtually non existent. It was quite bland. The pizza we had with bacon and (supposedly) capicola ham had better flavor than the pepperoni pizza (we believe thanks to the bacon). Now about that capicola - it was so NOT capicola. It was just regular deli ham. I specifically asked if they had capicola and was told yes.   We also had garlic knots. Which were actually dinner rolls brushed with garlic butter. WTH! Lets call that what it really is on the menu shall we. Pre-packaged dinner rolls with garlic butter.  The sauce was bland and watery. Probably poured right from a can.  I'm sorry to say that I would not recommend this place at all. Unless it's your only option."}
{"text":"Four stars are purely for the quality and deliciousness of the pizza. The only reason I won't give 5 is because of the atrocious customer service. The members of the staff are rude, impolite, and have no etiquette in terms of taking a delivery order. They really need new people. If you can put up with 5 minutes of the worst service in history then the pizza is worth it."}
{"text":"So it's Sunday night...football is on, and my boyfriend and I were craving some NY pizza. Because our game was in, we also wanted delivery.  I had passed mama's before and thought- why not give it a try!?  When I called to order, they told me because of our location ..that the minimum order would be 25 dollars.  We decided to pick it up of douse, because an additional minimum sounds insane for a place 1.8 miles from home( yes, I clocked it just to see).  Anyway,  we ordered a chicken parm pie, a Philly steak sub and a half a dozen knots. The knots=amazing, the pizza = okay and the sub wasn't bad. The food was alright but definitely not the NY food spot we were hoping to find.  Don't think we will order again, meh."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised after my visit here!!  There was no line or wait.  The service was great and he food came out very quickly.  The place was neat & clean, bathrooms in good condition.  They have so many things to choose from!!! I had an Italian sandwich and it was literally to die for!!!!! The BEST!!! I am so excited to try again!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the overall 3 rating on this place. Their pizza is outstanding. As good as any New York or New Jersey pizza. We ate outside and we all had slices and some of us added soup. All was excellent. They do need to clean up the bathrooms. It makes one wonder about the overall cleanliness when the bathrooms are in such poor shape. This is about the pizza and it was excellent"}
{"text":"Went here after my son's basketball practice one night. Expected it to be just like the one in Huntersville, but not even close. The pizza was terrible; it was barely even cooked. The bathroom was dirty, the garbage was overflowing, and the walls were all beat up. I wouldn't go back. All that said, the Huntersville locations is always excellent."}
{"text":"They said they had NY pizza, but this former NY pizza maker wasn't impressed. Overall everything was good but their sauce was very watered down and didn't have a lot of flavor. But other then that it was really good."}
{"text":"Our family ordered Chicken Parmesan for 11.  We picked it up the day before and reheated it in the oven for Easter dinner.  It was tender, delicious and we had a lot left over so the portion size quite large.  The owner worked with my mother-in-law to make everything perfect.  He even provided a sample portion for her to try which removed all doubt that our Easter Dinner would be wonderful.  Thanks for making our Easter Dinner so easy, delicious and special."}
{"text":"Ok! Home after a long day and getting ready for the game.. I thought \" pizza n wings\" YESSSS! .. Looked at promotional flyer \"pizza n wings special\" for delivery. The price advertised is 19.99. Somehow I Got charged twice that amount : ( .. So we are off to not such a great start, but hey mistakes are made daily, it's all about the comeback... Called to straighten out the discrepancy and told it would take 3-5 days for charge back on my account, happened to voiding out batch at end of the night/ or a refund.... Wow..,Really ... : /  ok watevs... So 50 bucks for a 19.99 pizza /wing special? Food was delivered on time as hoped but it came  cold, hot wings were cold, not to mention the size of my pinky finger...Can you say \"disappointed\" I definitely won't be ordering again from this establishment. That is unless I'm in the mood for some cold pizza in the morning for breakfast.... Really hoped for better, first time around but sorry there will be no next time....Friends help me out, I don't want to assume anything but is it typical for you to take your own food out of the delivery bag carried by the delivery driver or was it just me?? J/S...done and done...."}
{"text":"Poor service and a poor product...you can make a better pizza at home.  For better options try Hawthorne's or even better Tony's."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Horrible customer service. Picking up two pizzas for five children. I had to stop hard at a stop sign and that was he only reason I noticed that me whole Pizza was screwed up. I immediately called and  was interrogated by the front desk person that maybe someone else picked mine up. Just put another"}
{"text":"Tried mamas food for the first time tonight. Lasagna was cold in the middle, sent it back they put it in the microwave and gave it back like a soup, pretty gross. Ended up getting our money back. Garlic bites are absolutely disgusting! I'm warning you now about them, tasted like an entire bottle of garlic powder thrown on them, bread not cooked all the way. We could not even finish one each they were so bad. Eggplant parm was mushy, not very good. Pasta with sauce was the only good part of the meal, hard to screw up. But I would not trust and Italian style place with bad garlic bread!"}
