{"text":"This place popped up recently, and is a great find. They serve roti, jerk, etc.  So far have only tried the chicken roti, but it was delicious. Good portion, nice quality chicken, and delicious wrap. I should have asked for it hot, though, was lacking in some spice.  Reggae music was good, service was very friendly. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place for several times because I have no other choice for Caribbean food restaurant in this area. Every time, I  couldn't feel welcome from their employees. Today, I was line up there for about 5 mins, the lady saw me but keep chatting with the customer who front of me and this guy is ready to go. Finally they finish chatting, I went forward and stand front of the counter, the lady just ignored me and went away, I believe it has done on purpose. When I said\"hello\", another boy came without any smile. I won't come to this place anymore."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem just off the Danforth.  I've went in there for dinner a couple times, this month.  Their jerk chicken roti is to die for.   I'm also curious about the oxtail! I think i may get that next time, unless i get peer pressured into the chicken curry, which my friend Lance claims is the \"best he's ever had\"."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken... It is sooooo good, although the annoying thing about this restaurant is that sometimes it is open and sometimes it is closed when it should be open :P Oh well, it's just a surprise whenever you do get it! YUM"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I've actually never had Jerk Chicken in a Roti before. So that being said, I wasn't sure what to expect or how it's prepared. It was a weird feeling to walk in there completely blind, but there's a first for everything.  I walked in, it was empty at 8pm on Tuesday. I ordered the Boneless Jerk Chicken in Roti. She heats up the roti already in the microwave (would a toaster be better?) and begins to prepare the chicken (cutting off the meat off the bone).  It's clustered with potato on the Roti and she puts gravy all over it.  It's wrapped up and it's big. I wasn't sure how to eat it.   I brought it home, and surprisingly it didn't make as big of a mess as I had expected. She had asked if I wanted more gravy, I think I should have because some bits were dry. The chicken itself was very tasty though, but the gravy masks it.   What I should have done, was asked for the entire thing not in a wrap, but just as a meal, with the roti on the side for dipping. I think I may have enjoyed it more this way.   Would I come back? Maybe, in a long while, but Fish and Chips seem to outwin my craving for Jerk Chicken."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great, especially their Chicken Rotti. The people who work there are friendly staff and very attentive. Attention to all detail. I am HUGE fan. Prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Average. Or slightly better. Been twice, left both times feeling food was good/decent, service slow.  Way too hot for eat in during summer; might be worth investing in a couple fans/ac."}
{"text":"This is the best Caribbean food place I've been to thus far. The food is on point. I've grown up in a Caribbean household so I know what I'm talking about when I say their food is really good.  The prices are fair and the customer service is superb. Hope this review helps someone craving a little Caribbean flava!"}
{"text":"Been there on many occasions, their jerk chicken is amazing. For around $9 you get their big plate or $7 for small. The jerk chicken has been consistent every time. check it out if you are near Broadview station, south of danforth."}
{"text":"I had waltzed into the Dutchpot earlier this week after having passed it dozens of times on the streetcar and I was pleasantly surprised.  The decor is kind of homely and the tables are at times uneven, but the menu of Caribbean classics a was great way to satisfy my craving for good home cooked food.  The roti itself is store bought, similar to the ones sold by nofrills, but it doesn't take away from the rich balance of flavors in her curries and fillings. The serving size was actually very generous compared to other places and I definitely will drop by again if I need to avoid the pizza and burger joints in the area.

{"text":"Well I haven't been here in a while. It took almost 20 minutes to get my boneless (which had a couple small bones in it) chicken roti. Fine, I can fish out a couple bones and I don't mind waiting for something good. So prices were listed on the menu behind the counter for all roti at $0 today. Not sure why. But it's a mistake obviously. My roti was over $10. Again okay I don't mind paying for something good.  When offered, I said YES please hot sauce and I even added my own hot sauce when I got home. I'm sad to say, this roti filling had no flavour. All the relatively complex-spicy salty goodness I had enjoyed in previous rotis from this joint had vanished. The condiments only could do so much but clearly could not mask a blah batch. I also found the roti skin was pretty dry from being microwaved before they filled it.  I am sorry, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was in the Broadview/Danforth area so I decided to grab lunch at The Caribbean Dutchpot.  The restaurant is small and cozy with only a few tables for seating.  I got my lunch to go - beef curry with rice and peas ($4.99).  The portion size looked deceivingly small but the container was stuffed to the brim with beef, rice and a side of coleslaw.   Food was flavourful and I'm happy I got extra gravy as requested.  Wished I could have eaten my lunch under a palm tree on a warm Caribbean beach instead of at my desk staring at a screen saver of a beach.   So sad, so sad."}
{"text":"This place is so severely mom-and-pop that it summarizes my entire experience here.  This was my first time I've ever had this type of food before, but I was pleasantly surprised. The food is extremely flavourful, and my weakness toward spicy food immediately cropped up. I resorted to downing coleslaw to salve the burn, amusingly enough. The chicken was more tender and flaky than most chicken I've experienced, but that may be a function of the cooking style. It just felt very average. Though it was definitely a solid meal, nothing absolutely blew me away.  The store has, as previously mentioned, a mom-and-pop ambiance. The staff is friendly and the decor is questionable. I imagine people are more likely to order out, as the restaurant doesn't have many tables to sit at.  I liked it, but I'm willing to bet you can find better of this style of food."}
{"text":"Hard pass. Too expensive and the flavours are off. My chicken was burnt and I bought a medium and they gave me a small size chicken with a large plate of rice. A bust up scotch bonnet pepper in my rice nearly killed me and I feel like I have an ulcer now. Won't be heading back again and if I do, it'll be for a patty."}
{"text":"Stopped by today after what may be years of eyeing this place. I'm glad I did. I ordered the jerk chicken, stewed chicken and curry chicken. Also the coleslaw and plantains. All to go. No rice. No roti. My favorite hands down was the curry chicken. It was SO good. My eyes popped. The stew chicken and jerk were good too but after the party in my mouth from the curry they were less spectacular.  The coleslaw was great. Not greasy or creamy just clean and fresh. I just tried a plantain after 8 hours of it just sitting out and OMG....perfection. I know people like their plantains differently but I love mine caramelized and gooey and they were. I immediately reheated them and I'm pretty sure I growled while I inhaled them. The gentleman that was working, whom I assume is the owner was very friendly and funny. In general, a great experience and I will definitely go back. There is gluten and cornstarch in his sauces but hopefully I'll change his mind and get him to use alternatives. We'll see!"}
