{"text":"Way overpriced! A total ripoff!...no menu!...they mixed up my order and I was nice enough to pay what I would pay if I wanted to take out from an upscale restaurant but they were not professional enough to make sure people walk out their door happy!....I had seen a bad review on this place that 7 people found it useful before going to this place but I ignored it...what a mistake!"}
{"text":"Its really hard and almost impossible to get a farm fresh meat direct from a supply its always second or third handed thats why we been zamani customers for many years because there meat comes directly from there farm. We been very pleased !"}
{"text":"Super Zamani is located right next to Super Khorak.. what a difference in the vibes.   The inside is quite small...the selections seems minimum. Even the hot food section looks so runned down and unattractive. The funny thing is the price point is a little higher than Super Khorak...so not surprise there was hardly any people shopping here.  So if you need to pick up any Persian groceries save yourself time and money.. go next door! That's what we did!"}
