{"text":"Excellent Pacific Benedict, very good service, and great coffee.
I tipped them well."}
{"text":"This is a great, reliable gluten-free friendly good lunch restaurant.  I've never been for breakfast, but unless you're in at 12 on the dot, it's crazy until about 1:30 or so. I'm Celiac, so gluten-free is a must. 

I get the Mr Chicken on a gluten free bun.  It's delicious (I'm dreaming of it now) but hefty price tag.  Not helped by the one cook telling me he feels bad because you don't get as much fillings given the GF roll is smaller - plus they charge you ($2.50 I think?) for the GF roll.  So they're making a killing off it - runs me about $15 for the Mr Chicken, GF bun and a soda. 

However, I have never had any reaction when eating here. YAY - given their set up and how busy they can be that's quite impressive. I am as much a regular as I can be when working on the other side of town.  Only recommendation is for them to review their GF pricing."}
{"text":"The BEST Eggs Benedict in town. All their food is fantastic and the staff are very accommodating. Highly recommended for a \"brunch\" experience."}
{"text":"Did you know that these guys now have an app in the apple store and a Mobile ordering website at https://orders.cumuluspoint.com/holygrill/

No more line up, simply order and pay then walk in and collect!"}
{"text":"Wow, the bacon Avocado crisp is the greatest breakfast sandwich ever. Cute little place, the art changes frequently, and the staff is always friendly. I haven't tried their food truck yet, but I will someday"}
{"text":"A cold winter's day brought me here craving some Burgery (Is that even a word?) goodness. Having seen lots of reviews for this place I figured \"What could go wrong?\"  

Nothing did!

Haha, Got you all there!  By all means, the staff were friendly and very polite. I did receive quite the nice greeting from all of them there, I arrived before the lunch hour rush happened so it wasn't busy in there. 

The Burger and Fries I ordered weren't anything memorable, I mean. It wasn't a bad burger, it was okay. Just, well. Nothing stood out to me about the meal, I hesitate to criticize as there wasn't anything wrong with my meal just, well. The amount of hype people buzz about this place, maybe I was expecting something... more? (A certain well known Hot Dog Vendor on 17th may have suffered the same fate in my review last year...)

Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing? Maybe they were having an offday?  Were my taste buds on strike?  Does this suit make me look chubby? Will the Flames lose to the Sharks this weekend?

This requires further investigation I reckon next time I'm down in the area. As I am keen to point out, nothing wrong with what I had, and I am so going to try this place again. (Any suggestions on what to try?)

Major bonus points for the Staff's friendliness though! That's the type of stuff that will bring me back even if this place is somewhat out of my way!"}
{"text":"My buddy Ryan raves about the Holy Grill. He works pretty much next door and I'm not kidding when I say he could write out the menu. He's had it all a million times. We were downtown and decided to try it for lunch. 

The Holy Grill is a basically a clean, nice diner. It's definitely not a greasy spoon. There are no servers. You order at the front when you walk in and when your order is ready they call your name.The place was filled with a well dressed lunch crowd who probably weren't there for the first time. The walls are covered with original art work (nice stuff too) by local artists. You can purchase the art work if you like and it changes on a regular basis.

My friend had me convinced to try a burger before I even walked in door, so I didn't really look at the menu. The lunch menu pretty much consists of burgers and paninis - my kind of place. Anytime I am in a place for the first time, I keep it simple and order the restaurants specialty in a simple form. I figure if they can do something simple and get it right, the rest of it will be great. 

I was disappointed to see that when the burger came, the meat that was used was a frozen pattie, but there were two of them. Where I grew up in Nova Scotia, there is no shortage of family run, mom and pop style diners, greasy spoons, etc... and they wouldn't dare serve a frozen pattie style burger. I thought when I moved to Calgary, home of Alberta beef, I was in for a treat with all the great burgers I would be trying. I really am shocked how many places server frozen meat in this city. I've only found a handful that don't. I would have thought that by looking at this place, there is no way this would be the case. The burger was good and very filling, the highlight though was the fries. Probablly the best fries I've ever had in Calgary. My friend tells me that the sweet potato chips are awesome too, but these fries were so good that I'm not sure I could go there and not get them again.

Looking around the room it seemed that the percentage of people eating paninis to burgers was 75% to 25%. The panini's were popular and looked delicious. Next trip I'll be going that route for sure. I also here great things about their breakfast. I wouldn't expect anything less. Check out the Holy Grill."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome and trendy! My friend and I both had the Eggs Benny and it was delicious!!! Might even be the best I've ever tried other than Blue Star's but seriously they were amazing. There's not a huge selection of breakfast food (it's mostly all about the Benny's) but still worth checking out. The only thing bad about this place is how awkward it is to get a table because since you have to go up and order yourself, you have to wait for a free table so there's not much room to stand and wait. But all in all, it's a fantastic breakfast joint and I would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Well........I went in for breakfast with fairly high hopes.  My favourite breakfast places are OEB and Diner Deluxe; I was hoping for something comparable. 

The place was not busy, maybe four tables occupied. I ordered the pacific benny.  One of the eggs broke during poaching and was still plopped on disappointingly yolkless. 

The smashbrowns were fried to death and tasted as though they had been cooked prior and had subsequently experienced a warmer for an extended period of time.

Won't be back for breakfast.  Maybe I'll take a swing at lunch and see...."}
{"text":"Best eggs benny in Calgary. Great staff and atmosphere too. Its my go to place for breakfast. Thank you Holy Grill!!"}
{"text":"Love everything here, good ingredients, made with love. Gets busy at lunchtime but worth the wait or take to go if you can!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast/lunch place. Unfortunately NOT open on weekends, caters to the working crowd- right downtown. Fast counter/pager service, food was fresh and tasty. I recommend the avocado-egg-bacon sandwich. It was yummy."}
{"text":"Great spot for burgers and brunch. The hours are a bit odd, so you can't go for diner. But definitely recommend for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. We went shopping at MEC and had lunch across the street. First visit. The roasted beet salad was perfect and the staff were very professional."}
{"text":"Cute local eatery that has been around for a long time. Great customer service, love the beet chips and Mr. Chicken."}
{"text":"Just finished a Mr. Chicken for lunch today. I have to admit this was my first visit. Needless to say it will not be my last. I won't rest until I have tried everything on the menu.
Went in today, the line-up was 3 people ahead of me. I waited maybe 7 minutes for my food. While you are waiting there is an abundance of reading material to choose from. It was a Monday after 12:30 and there were many places to sit, however I could see it being a bit of an ordeal to get a seat on a busier day. 
Great food, good prices and an inviting atmosphere. If you haven't tried it I definitely recommend that you do, and if you have tried it why are you even reading this?"}
{"text":"Paninis...Benedict...as many refills of your coffee as you can drink...I love it here!!!! The service is always friendly and fast. I love the casual atmosphere. The portions are large. I only wish they were open everday and the space was bigger. :)"}
{"text":"Damn, did I eat at the same restaurant as y'all?

Those Pacific Benny's look so good, like they were made somewhere else.

I ordered the Super Burger, cuz, you know, burgers are near 'impossible' to screw up.

All I got was a bland tasting patty that I could easily have paid for at Harvey's. No doubt.

The experience almost makes me feel bad for my write-up of Boogie's. Almost.

I would go back for breakfast but an establishment tells me a lot when they can't serve up a decent tasting burger.

But still, those Benny's...

Might give em' a second chance. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Consistently good burgers and delicious panni. I'm a fan of the mr chicken and the pacific. Friendly staff are the icing on the cake. 

I just wish they were open into the evening."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Holy Grill for breakfast I ask myself the same two questions:
1. Why did I wait so long before coming back?
2. How do they make the hashbrowns SO good??
I always have the benny, either the original or the California (with tomato & avacodo), both are amazing.  But the hashbrowns!!  Let's just say it's probably a good thing I don't know how to make these myself!
It's a tiny place and you have to order at the counter before you sit down, and there might be a wait for a table, but the staff is friendly and they make sure you get a coffee or water while you wait...and it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Tried Mr. Chicken, Roasted Beet Salad & Smoked Salmon Panini, all of them are fantastic plus the friendly and quick staff. Must go."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or lunch. The main reason for the 5 star rating is the convenience of pre-ordering from their App.  No need to line up, I pre-order from my iPhone.  Looking forward to the new location opening up soon."}
{"text":"Having returned here and sampled more, I can't think of anything they could do to make a better breakfast (except serve it to me in bed)...ergo, upgrade to five stars!  Great quality ingredients, decent menu selection, diligent food preparation, friendly service, open kitchen, artsy decor.  'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"I love the food at the Holy Grill. Sometimes a bit of a line during peak times, but the line moves quickly and I suppose that is the downfall of any place with amazing food. My favourite is the New Californian Panini - generous portion and unique, delicious flavours (Cream cheese, provolone, banana peppers, red onion, pickled eggplant & red cabbage grilled zucchini & yam, artichoke hearts + tomato) I never get tired of it! Add a side of veggie chips, and you've got a great meal for two. And the service has always been friendly to boot."}
{"text":"Love the Panini's and beet chips!
I would strongly recommend this place for lunch, although be prepared! It gets pretty busy. I am a big fan of the Pacific and Italian Panini, and the Mr. Chicken seems to be a staple for a lot of my friends and family. The servings are large and the staff is welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick to-go breakfast. Ordered a sandwich with the GF bun & hold the meat. The super nice chef offered some sautéed artichokes instead of bacon (ummm YES!!), which was so awesome! I don't remember the name of the sandwhich but it had egg & avocado & pickled eggplant I think. Well, it was quite possibly the best breakfast sammie I've ever had. Seriously, go here- especially if you're a touch hungover!!"}
{"text":"Been here for burgers and breakfast and the food is great! It is small, crowded and noisy but the food is worth it. The breakfast procedure is a bit confusing for those first timers. Also the \"wait\" staff is a bit confusing for those first timers. It is a cross between restaurant and fast food - for example at breakfast there is someone to seat you once your food is almost done but then you have to go to the counter to get your food. I plan to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Went in to try the veggie burger on a Saturday afternoon.  Not too busy.  The burger was great and the fries were excellent.  My son and I shared the burger/fries and we were full.  We will be back one day for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best Brunch spot ever! I wish they were open Sundays!!! This is my go-to spot in the summer to have an Eggs Benny outside on the patio! DELISH! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and exceptionally friendly waitstaff. The breakfast menu covers the main standbys but the eggs Benedict had slightly thin hollandaise and the egg was over easy rather than poached. Tastes nonetheless and the home fries were excellent. Tea selection is sparse although the coffee station looked great so I'm guessing that's the stronger option. Overall enjoyable and I'd return again."}
{"text":"Very busy place with a long wait so get there as early as possible!! When the weather is nice make use of the patio!!!!!
They have a steak truck across the street with super awesome steak bites!!"}
{"text":"Bare bones room, great benny.  MEC across the street doesn't open until well after breakfast, so there's plenty of free parking, too."}
{"text":"Yum!  Second time here and totally awesome. Had the south beach benny, delicious hollandaise! The staff are wonderful looking forward to going back. 
Not a huge fan of the coffee, it's a DIY setup.  but the food makes up for that.
Sat on the patio outside, not too much to look at but the food was brilliant!"}
{"text":"Great format for a sandwich joint. Took a bit of time for my order to come up, but well worth the wait! Sandwiches to die for!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the smashed potatoes. Found them oily. Also the restaurant is tiny and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Ate here regularly when I worked in the area. Food was consistently good & staff was pleasant. Love the veggie burger & chicken burger. Breakfast is also very good. Eat here. You will feel full and happy!"}
{"text":"I eat out all the time and enjoy great food. This is a great way to get away from the typical ast food I normaly have...will definatly return... no complaints except my food a bit salty. I loved it but I have to watch the salt in my diet. Prices are very fair for what you get..."}
{"text":"This place is great! The price absolutely can't be beat for what you are getting! Because of several of the reviews, I ordered the Mr. chicken, which sadly I would not recommend as it was kind of dry, but the chicken burger and avocado burger were amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here for a first date, and was more impressed by the venue than by the date. Food was fresh and delicious, well prepared and presented. The staff was friendly and helpful, despite my noobish attempts at humorously ordering. 

I highly recommend stopping in here. Its a shame, that I lived in this neighbourhood for over a year and never had the thought to check this place out."}
{"text":"great place to eat at. great location. Even better prices!!. if you like 5guys burger and fries or burger co. you will love this place 10x better but with prices comparable to 5guys & burger co. good vibe. Friendly staff.  FREEEEER PARKING!!!!!. first time eating here and I will be returning hopefully soon!. this place earned each and everyone of those STARS!!!!. I gave 5 Stars ***** over all this place has 4.5 out of 5 with 60+ reviews!! THATS SAYING ALOT!!. keep up the good work holy grill!. however the only complaint I have is this place is packed and such a small waiting area for your food it feels like your in a packed elevator lol. this place deserves a huge spot it needs it

ps- That's a BOSS name for a burger joint"}
{"text":"The Southbeach Benny is quite good. Though the hashbrowns remind me of something I might find at a crossroads truck stop in a ghost town. Love the room and the self serve concept is not for everyone, but fun. It might be a good idea to put the self serve coffee separate from the server station. I felt like I was somewhere that I was not supposed to be while getting my coffee. The Southbeach Benny is beautiful, that was worth mentioning twice. I'll be back."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in Calgary. 

Here are some tips:
- You can call ahead to order and save the wait at peak times.
-Even when it is busy the wait is never very long

For breakfast my favourite items are:
-The Eggs Benedict made \"Calgaryism\" style
-The Bacon Avocado Crisp Sandwhich
-The Sausage Nic-Muffin (so darn good)

For Lunch:
-The gourmet burger with extra blue cheese
-Mr Chicken Panini
-Pacifico Panini

You actually cannot go wrong at the Holy Grill. Nick, Andrew, John and Glenn are so nice and make sure every customer feels like a friend.

Check it out, this is one of Calgary's best places to eat for quality of food and probably the best single place to eat for value in what you get."}
{"text":"Small menu, really good food. Had a fried egg sandwich with avocado, bacon cheddar, and pickled eggplant. I was wondering how well you could possibly make a fried egg sandwich (considering the amazing reviews), turns out you can make a really great fried egg sandwich! Loved it. 
No table service, you order at the front and they give you a vibrating alarm for when your food is ready. That keeps their (and your) cost down."}
{"text":"Top notch for the price. Quality ingredients. Super friendly"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the Holy Grill.

I've been several times, and not once has my experience with the food or service been anything other than exceptional.  I've only ever gotten panini's to go, but I would love to have a dine-in meal here for either breakfast or lunch.  Their panini's are really good.  My two favourites are the farmhouse (eggs, bacon, cheese and tomato) and the Mr. Chicken (grilled chicken, bacon, roasted red peppers, tomatoes).  I always ask for the Mr. Chicken sans red pepper, since I'm not a big fan... and they always suggest that I add on spinach instead.  I always agree, and I'm always supremely pleased that I did.  The guys working the open kitchen area have perfected panini making - and work together to get the food out efficiently.  It's fun to watch their high-energy bustle as your panini gets prepared.

I would highly recommend the Holy Grill for anyone who hasn't had the pleasure to try it."}
{"text":"Great food but shame about the free-for-all seating.  This place gets packed at lunch and people hover around those eating so they can grab a table as soon as it becomes free.  The friction and hostile interactions this causes casts a pall over an otherwise great little grill.  I'd give it five stars if they took a wait list for tables and seated everyone in turn."}
{"text":"Cool and relaxed atmosphere. Order at a kitchen and it comes to your table. Informal but the food was good. I had a curry chicken soup and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is brunch heaven. If you do not mind the wait, get in here and order pretty much whatever you want. You will love it. The atmosphere is great for a lazy Saturday morning, and the food will make you smile every time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come for breakfast at Holy Grill with all of the raving reviews on Yelp. Obviously there are people who like this style of dining. I do not. 

As soon as I walked in, expecting to be greeted and guided to a table, I was confronted by a woman who handed me a menu, told me to sit anywhere, and to come back to the counter when I was ready to order/pay. I was a little taken back. 

I already had an idea of what I wanted, and knowing that I needed to eat and then be on my way, I ordered immediately after only a quick peek at the menu. I ordered South Beach Benedict, and asked for some type of modification to eliminate the glutinous English muffin. The cook suggested a bed of spinach, which I thought was an excellent idea, and has merited a star for the sake of this review. 

I paid for my meal, and in exchange was handed my receipt and a buzzer so that I could be notified when my food was ready. Let me be clear, if I'm speeding $20 on breakfast + a tip, I expect to sit down at a table, and to receive wait service. At the very least, deliver the food to my table so that I don't have to get up every 10 minutes. 

The coffee was pretty good, and offers bottomless refills... if you're willing to get up and refill it yourself, of course. It is self-serve after all. 

The food: it was good. Nothing is write home about, but it was good. I sort of wished my bed of spinach was cooked, not raw, but I guess beggars can't be choosers. (Then again, I didn't exactly beg, I paid... hummm.) One thing that was my fault, and not the kitchen's, was that in my haste to order, I forgot to mention that I like my eggs poached hard, so I had to deal with the nasty runny yolk. The smashbrowns were good. They are potatoes that have been expertly deep fried to a golden brown shell which is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, like any good French fry. I suspect this is the result of choosing the right potato, and the right oil, plus keeping the oil clean as a whistle. Degree of difficulty: 3/5.

Between the tasty coffee and the good food, I've given a second star to the review. I believe this restaurant appeals to hipsters, and as it is located directly across from MEC, they are conveniently located to cater to their crowd."}
{"text":"Best place to get paninis!the beet chips are so crispy and delicious! Only downside is there is not much table to dine in."}
{"text":"After dropping money at MEC, which happens everything I walk-in, I find myself rewarding myself with some Holy Grill.

They make solid panninis. I had Mr. Chicken and it was oh so good. The weather's been amazing, so I rocked my meal out back on their lounge.

You definitely have to get their sweet potato and beat chips. Very good. 

I'll be back for more on my next excursion to MEC."}
{"text":"Excellent value, friendly service, and great food - worth the long lines on weekends. 

The setup is a little different, you put your name down and order your food first. From there you wait for your name to be called and as soon as you sit they start cooking your food so it's fresh.

I got the bacon avocado breakfast sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was delicious. It was a little too much bread, but I just ate around it. My friend got the brunch burger and it looked amazing. I didn't try any, but did snag some of his fries, which were cooked and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"If you have not yet been to The Holy Grill, grab your bag, grab a friend and get there already.

I had heard raving reviews about the place, but like any TRUE critic, I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about.

Not ONLY are the gentlemen that work there some of the NICEST guys around, but daaaammmmn, can they ever serve up a DELICIOUS meal! I tried the Sicilian Panini (zucchini, yams, eggplant and provolone cheese) and I dreamt about it last night. No word of a lie.

The panini itself is a generous size and it's completely reasonable for a downtown lunch! I'm talkin' 8 bucks and your stomach & tastebuds will thank you for days on end.

So here's what I'm saying: Holy Grill is as good as it gets and it's time you got there."}
{"text":"Great food, beet chips to die for. And the paninis are just mouth watering. Gets very busy during lunch hour so it would be hard to find a seating but if you're just looking for take-out, it wouldn't take too long even during the rush hour. Definitely my go-to place for lunch!"}
{"text":"These guys crank out awesome burgers.  I ordered the Gourmet Burger with avocado and blue cheese - fantastic burger goodness.  Also, loved the perfectly salted, warm sweet potato chips!

This place was crazy busy for lunch... and they should be, their food rocks!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend holy grill for lunch! I used to come here all the time and it was always delicious. I especially love the breakfast items. If your food doesn't arrive in a timely manner go up to the counter to check - they somehow forgot my order twice while I was there."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers, great, friendly service, but no pickles? Hmrph. (Get the pickled eggplant though. Delish.)"}
{"text":"How can a sandwich shop be \"inspired\"?  It's not really possible since the same basic formula of 'bun-accoutrements-bun' seems to apply universally. At least that was my impression until I set foot inside this little cool grill in the middle of downtown Calgary, due solely to awesome yelp reviews. 

Boy, was I wrong! The Holy Grill achieves pure Nirvana in terms of taste, combining fresh ingredients in a creative menu, adding touches of perfection like ripe avocados, glowing tomatoes, fresh jams and nuts to standard fares and creating something altogether new and divine. It is not the mere ingredients, but the flawless execution, bringing harmony to the flavors and balance to the spices. I had a chicken wrap with melted cheese and avocados, where the chicken was thinly sliced and juicy, the ingredients stacked perfectly and the wrap lightly toasted to bring out the flavor. My brother had the veggie burger, which he devoured with the ferocity of a starved N Korean prisoner, extolling its taste and consistency. 

Everything is perfectly understated and just fits, like the comfortable chairs and booths, the melodic indie music that plays in the background, and the wonderful staff that are eager to please. Lucky you, downtown Calgary-dwellers! 

I wish I could transport this little shop to Miami with me, but since I can't, it's comforting enough to know that such places exist and I look forward to my return, where this will likely be one of my very first stops..."}
{"text":"A friend and I met up for an early lunch today at The Holy Grill. After reading the excellent Yelp reviews, it seemed like the best choice. 
I ordered an Italian Panini with Beet Root chips and dip. She ordered a burger and fries with avocado and grilled onions. She's on a gluten and lactose free diet. 
First, she was delivered an incorrect order (I believe it was a panini of some kind). After they told her the burger would be ready in 2 minutes, her meal was made incorrectly with cheese, so she had to send it back again. She did eventually get the correct order.
Mine didn't come for 25 minutes. After 15 minutes of waiting, I politely asked the server at the till when it would be ready. She said it would be ready when my coaster beeped. I sat back down and after another 5 minutes asked where my order was. The kitchen didn't have it, so I waited for them to make it. That's 25 minutes for a panini and chips. 
This issue could have easily been resolved by the server checking with the kitchen the first time I asked about my order. 
We thought the food was really good. 
I'm taking off two stars for the experience."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast - great customer service! We had a chicken panini, the blackened chicken burger and I had the beet salad. Everyone loved their meals. It was lunchtime and we only had half an hour to order and eat. No problem. Parking on the side of the building is convenient. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Holy Grill ALWAYS puts a smile on my face or my tummy.  There's nothing wrong with this place except the long lineup at lunch time! 
My coworker and I ordered their Egg Benedict to share.....and they actually split it into two plates for us.  Their service is just amazing.  I haven't been to a restaurant that would do that without asking. 
Food (breakfast/lunch) is excellent, top notch!  Oh by the way, coffee/tea is free during breakfast time."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The food is so good & so fresh. My favorite was the salmon panini. Everything was yummy. Nice outdoor patio. You have to order at counter then they'll bring you food. Highly recommend for brunch."}
{"text":"Fast original food great staff if food is flavorful  fresh
Parking could be a little difficult
But overall worth the drive"}
{"text":"Really good paninis - the holy chicken and the salmon one are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, cute spot, good looking menu. But... Long wait (but I'm not holding that against them, it's expected for a \"5-star\" lunch spot). It's just the food that didn't impress me. The Californian panini taste like a wrap full of salsa IMHO, and the dab of cream cheese was wimpy. I hate to be such a downer and I want to give props to a well-known local business so I'll give it another try..."}
{"text":"I love grabbing lunch at the Holy Grill. The staff are super friendly and the food is delicious.

We frequently order lunch at my office and The Holy Grill is by far the easiest and fastest place to deal with. The call is always fast, the order is always right and everything is packed up small enough that I can carry enough food for 10 people in my backpack. Hoorah!

I usually go for the Sicilian but if I'm a little hungrier I'll grab a Farmhouse."}
{"text":"I love this place, I make sure I make it for lunch there at least once every few months.  The staff are super friendly, food is fresh, quality and served up fast.  Fairly limited seating, but I've never had an issue snagging a table.  Paninis and Sweet Potato chips are killer."}
{"text":"Food here is excellent and they have lots of healthy choices. Its great because they cater to most dietary restrictions (vegan and gluten free to name a couple) so all my friends can get together for lunch. 

It always seems full but a table always seems to open up by the time your food is ready. Love the beet salad and the chicken burger here.

last time I ordered a Mr. Chicken wrap and asked for no tomato, no onion, the chef piled the chicken on instead to \"fill it up\"!

the portions are large here so stick to one item!"}
{"text":"The gluten free option was OK, nothing special. Also very pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Just having a bit of a lunch at holy grill, first time here, have coffee cake and coffee, it's good stuff. Cozy little spot."}
{"text":"After staying in Calgary for a couple of days, we were delighted to discover this amazing little restaurant. We arrived slightly too late for the brunch menu the first day, and instead opted for a burger & fries. It was hands-down one of the best burgers I've ever had. We sat on the back patio, which was cozy & busy. We had such a great experience here that we came back several days later on our stop through town to try the breakfast we missed out on the first time around. Their eggs benny (regular & smoked salmon) was also very good. We highly recommend this place, though it's a shame the hours are a bit limited. Do seek it out if you are in the area, it's definitely worth arranging your schedule to fit it in."}
{"text":"Fun downtown experience. Food was great. Busy little treasure. We got the ranch burger & blackened chicken sandwich. Both excellent. Shared sweet potato fries ( plenty for two)."}
{"text":"Overall Fantastic And Lovely Staff, Amazing Panini's I'll Be Back For Sure! 
Just Done Right On The Grill And I Have Many Allergies So They Made Sure Nothing I Was Allergic Was On The Grill By Cleaning It First. I'm One Satisfied Customer"}
{"text":"I love this place - the burgers and paninis are pretty amazing!! One word - WOW!! 

Super friendly staff and great service as always! Run by 3 brothers who do a bang up job - highly recommended if you're in the Calgary area! :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for something Canadian and they had it. The people were pretty friendly and accommodating for travelers too. Good size plates!"}
{"text":"All right - really, no reason I should not give a 5 star ... except it's order at the counter. I love full service.  Food was delivered at the table. Delicious! The Bacon Avacado Crisp was perfect. Enjoyed hanging here & reading instruction manual from my latest purchase from across the street at MEC."}
{"text":"Fantastic, Fast, Personable Service, and the Owners care. It's packed in there and they still have time to talk to you and create delicious FOOD!"}
{"text":"Since last year I have taken on the Atkins diet and at first it was so hard to find a good restaurant with a lot of meat and chicken options that still tasted good without the bread and man was I pleased with The Holy Grill! 

I love this place. The food is spectacular and really tasty. Good flavour and I am just over all pleased. I recommend this to every one I know. 

Keep up it!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best veggie burger I've had in Calgary. The portions are huge. I'm not a huge fan of the fries. A few times they've been under/over cooked."}
{"text":"Since I discovered this place I love coming here for lunch!! I usually get their chicken panini but their lunch specials are an awesome deal that comes with fries. It's always busy but it's worth it cause they're usually pretty quick and everything is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I've had a long standing love affair with The Holy Grill going on 12 years now. 
What really blows me away is the same guys are still there giving the same over the top friendly attention to their customers as they ever have. How is this possible? Well, there's no act to put on. They're the most genuine, nicest guys who make the most genuine, meanest panini! 

In a rush? they'll have your fresh food ready before you can even get your wallet out.

I swear this place invented sweet potato/yam chips for Calgary. Even if they didn't, they sure well set the standard. 

3 Words. Blackened Chicken Panini. Why isn't this on the menu?! The Blackened Chicken Burger and the Mr. Chicken Panini are both solid. This would be one super sexy hybrid!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a fast and high quality breakfast that was close to our hotel in downtown Calgary! We were looking for breakfast sandwiches and outdoor seating and Holy Grill checked off all boxes.

A little more on the fast casual side, you can order up at the grill and then your food gets delivered to the table. On a Friday morning there was plenty of available seating outside. We caught the tail end of breakfast - at 11 am the grill menu switches over from breakfast to lunch! 

I ordered a bacon egg and cheese on an english muffin and it was perfect, simple and delicious. I also threw in a side of home fries which came with frizzled onions and parm cheese - interesting way to serve them but delicious nonetheless. The breakfast paninis looked tasty but way too big for breakfast, I'm glad that I stuck with a sandwich. 

Not much more to say because this is a quick and easy trip, but I highly suggest for breakfast or lunch if you want a fast and delicious breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about
Had eggs Bennie , meat was a ham? Sooo salty, almost in edible
Potatoes burnt and grey , crumbled to powder under application of the fork
Expensive , about $5 more than other breakfast spots"}
{"text":"Mr Chicken.
Its the bees knees. SO good. Im addicted to smashbrowns.
And I'm a sucker for homemade dip or aioli."}
{"text":"The holy grill=eggs Benedict. Need I say more? No, but of course I will. It's hard to find a good benne with a nice hollandaise sauce, but holy grill has got you covered. The latte is nice too, and the homemade chips. Sometimes it's a bit crowded, but they really do a great job managing it and we've never actually waited more than about 5-10 minutes."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and tidy, it looks alright, but I've seen better restaurant designs that stands out more. Anyway, the looks are not that important. I ordered a simple hamburger, roasted beef salad, also a soup as a side dish. I'll start with the burger, the burger tastes good and quite juicy, though it's a little pricey, with it's size and width, it's almost as big as a \"Big Mac\" burger, but it's alright and the tender, juicy meat is enough for me, but the salad in the other hand is the real deal, the sauce, avocado, artichoke, red onion, tomato and parmesan is a really good combination, quite a variety and rich flavours. I ordered another one for seconds. I really have nothing negative to say about it, but the soup is alright, its quite bland and \"plain\" but I don't really care, it's just a side dish. I would recommend anyone to try out the \"Roasted Beef Salad\", but if your going for the hamburger or soup, your better off with Burger King and Campbell soup instead."}
{"text":"Great food. I'm happy to have discovered this place and a little disappointed that I hadn't sooner. I have been to The Holy Grill twice in the past week, the first time for a take-out lunch and the second for a sit-in mid-afternoon \"lunch\".

Both times the service has been quick and the food quite tasty! I have tried their Blackened Chicken Burger, New Californian Panini, Bacon Avocado Crisp, and their Yam Chips. Every meal was full of flavour and the presentation was great.

So far the Bacon Avocado Crisp is my favourite but that might change as I foresee myself having many more lunches here. I would recommend this place to anybody looking for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"The best grilled wraps in town - they also make a mean burger. Sweet potato chips or beet fries are also wicked."}
{"text":"Great food and super-friendly staff here.  Their dining room leaves something to be desired - it's always packed , but everything else is fantastic.  The Mr. Chicken makes an awesome lunch to go."}
{"text":"The Holy Grill has been known to me for awhile for their paninis. Its not uncommon that we get them catered to our office for meetings, so there are often yummy leftovers available in the kitchens.  I have tried most of their paninis through work and they are delightful.  They are made with fresh ingredients, so they are always tasty.

But admittedly, I have a new love at the Holy Grill.

I actually went into their establishment on Wednesday after quick trip to Mountain Equipment Co-op, and I saw that they also have a burger menu that looked pretty fantastic.

I was not in the mood for beef, so I ordered the blackened chicken burger, and I also got a side of sweet potato chips and the verdict was....O....M....G.

That is without a doubt, THE BEST chicken burger I have had in this city, ANYWHERE.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, and all of the toppings were the perfect combination.  It didn't need ketchup or anything else.  Seriously, just try it as it is before you start messing with something that is simply mouthwatering on its own.  The barbeque sauce they use is unbelievable.

And the bun... oh, then bun!  It is extremely soft.  Its one of those perfect, fresh buns that when you hold your burger, you don't want to squeeze it too tight, because you don't want to sink your fingerprints into it.  

Just when I thought I couldn't get happier - I tried the sweet potato chips.  I am a fan of sweet potato fries no matter where I order them, so these were as awesome \"tasting\" as any other sweet potato product I have tried.  But it had two extra wins over other sweet potato products:

1.  Texture. They were more like chips than fries. They were sliced thin, so some where crispy like chips.  Nom nom.  

2.  The dipping sauce is unbelievable.  Its kind of creamy, garlicy and spicy all at the same time.  Dipping your sweet potato chips in there take it to a whole new level.

After enjoying that chicken burger on Wednesday, I grabbed two of my colleagues and went back on Thursday. lol.  At 10 a.m., all I could think about was having that blackened chicken burger for lunch again.

Well done, Holy Grill!  Well done!"}
{"text":"These guys are so funny and friendly, I literally wanted to climb up onto the counter (which btw, made me feel like a small child, it's so high!) and give them a hug, or a high five.

My soup of the day (steak) and garden salad were well endowed, portion wise. And the sweet potato chips, well they are the holy grail.... errr grill. Get the dipping sauce - garlic yum!

I was looking for faith in lunch, and I think I found it!"}
{"text":"Good small diner with plenty of choices. In my opinion the price is quite reasonable for the portion. We ordered panini for lunch and if I remember correctly one is called Mr. chicken the other is called Hot chick. Both are yummy and healthy. I like Hot chick better as it has more of a Mexican food flavour to it. Would eat there again next time visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"expensive for pre made everything and tiny burger patties.  it was just standard.  The real ripoff is the 3$ mini carton of chocolate milk."}
{"text":"I like that there is a parking lot next to the place dedicated to visitors of the restaurant though! Especially with how busy this block can get with MEC right across the street - their parking lot is crazy busy! 

I find it a bit awkward that you have to go and find your own table and there is no one directing you to a table once one becomes available. You basically have to fight over a table with people if there are lots of other people waiting. You also have to fill your own water and get your own condiments. I guess it is a self serve kind of style, but I like a good restaurant with good service. I also think that the prices should reflect the lack of service they provide too.

I think the Holy Grill is a cute little place for brunch but I don't know if it is one of the best places in Calgary. The food is definitely on the better side, but nothing seemed super amazing to me on the handful of times I've been there. I got side of the homemade dip for my fries and it tasted kind of bland. The food presentation is very nice though. Either way, if you are looking for a new places to check out for breakfast, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not sure why this is called a breakfast place bc it had had pretty much 3 (at best) breakfast items (or maybe I'm completely blind and can't read menus).
Had the wakey wakey (or whatever) potatoes were overcooked and bacon was very tough (eggs were ok though). 
Not cheap either $13 with coffee and I don't feel too good, if you're going to come here try something else (not breakfast)."}
{"text":"Mmm! I really enjoyed coming here for lunch. The place is very laid back, casual and inviting. We arrived just after the lunch rush, so we found a table without issue (self-seating). We took a look at the menu which is quite small, but extremely vegan and vegetarian friendly- yay! You order your own meal and pre-pay, then sit down with a coaster that vibrates when your food is ready to pick up. I ordered the vegetarian Panini, which was AWESOME. It had a whole garden of roasted vegetables inside with cream cheese and spices and was delicious! My spouse has the BBQ burger which he really enjoyed. Service was very fast and the staff were friendly. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"They must put crack in their \"smash browns.\" It would be nice if this place were open on Sundays however, and it would be nice if they served their delicious breakfast all day during the week. There's a dearth of good breakfast options in the centre of Calgary on Sundays and we ended up eating at our hotel.

The style here is upscale fast food - you order and pick up your order at the counter, but it's served on regular plates. The eggs benedict was perfectly prepared (woo-hoo, none of those microwaved poached eggs here), and the hollandaise sauce was homemade and well seasoned.

I shall return here when in Calgary."}
{"text":"This was the perfect mid-day meal after several days of indulging in not-so-healthy foods. We ordered the tomato soup, beet chips with homemade dip, roasted beet salad and mr. chicken panini with bbq sauce. Everything tasted super fresh and delicious! You place your order at the counter and they give you a buzzer and will bring out your food. There's limited seating indoors but they have a nice outdoor patio. I could definitely see myself coming here for lunch daily if we had a location in my area."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pacific eggs Benedict,  and my person ordered the wakey wakey with sausages.  

What I loved most was the hashbrown that was on the side of our meal.  It was crispy,  salty,  and just so good. I love it when hashbrown are cooked like this!  

The food and everything was good as well.  The Sausage I believe is an Italian,  and it wasn't at all greasy.  

When you come here,  you order up at the bar and you grab the utensils,  ketchup,  etc.  I don't mind because this place makes up for the 'lack' of service with their food."}
{"text":"My friend and I try to go somewhere new for breakfast once a month and have tried many Breakfast spots in Calgary.  Today we had the best eggs benny ever at the Holy Grill. The super friendly staff split the plate for us.  The eggs were perfect , sauce was delicious and the side of potatoes were crisp.  This will be the one breakfast spot we will try again."}
{"text":"Hit up the Holy Grill for lunch today with a couple of co-workers. I always order the Italian Panini because it's delicious.... As it was today. The service is great and the owners always greet us and thank us for coming. The only thing that I don't like is the set up for ordering. If there is more than two people in line, and there always is, it gets crowded and confusing. But I will suck that up a couple of times a month because it's worth it."}
{"text":"So I've been going to this place quite regularly now and it's been impressive every time! The quality is consistent, ingredients are always fresh and the folks are always friendly! 

Another thing I find amazing about it is how different their paninis are. Every panini has a completely different feel to it and they are all really good, even the vegetarian stuff! :-P The yam is to die for! 

Gotta tell you, there's nothing better than to kick-off your Saturday morning with a delicious panini from Holy Grill! I'm lucky I live nearby.

Don't forget they do catering as well. No matter how big your group is or how busy they are, they will take care of you!"}
{"text":"A fantastic place to have stopped on our Canadian road trip for a quick bite. We came in for lunch mid-week, and ordered a Ranch Burger and a New Californian, with avocado subbed for cheese. Both burger and panini were great - perfectly cooked, dressed, and flavorful without excessive grease. The price for what we got was great, too (this was A LOT of food)! Service was friendly and quick, and the atmosphere was relaxed and cheery. Stop in for a good sandwich!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on \"you gotta eat here\" and they were raving about the smashbrowns and the breakfast so naturally I thought there must be something special about this place!
Sadly I was disappointed - I got there at noon and they stop serving breakfast at 11...disappointment #1 
Add that to the fact that the ordering process is somewhat strange (you have to order the food yourself and then go pick it up yourself, get your own cutlery and water, which if the food was phenomenal, I wouldn't mind so much...let the foreshadowing begin) 

So I thought ok, since this is a grill let me try the burger - loaded burger, with fried egg and bacon replaced with avocado and fries replaced with smashbrowns - it was nice of them to accommodate me but...the burger, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't delicious either - a normal average burger (disappointment #2). The smashbrowns were a huge let down! I'm not sure what the guy on you gotta eat here was talking about since these tasted like regular fried potatoes (disappointment #3)...in short, I didn't have to eat here

I might try it again for breakfast but I might opt for an all day breakfast diner instead...I haven't decided yet"}
{"text":"Excellent combinations... I had the Pacific Panini - smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers and red onions. Grilled just right. The soup of the day was a Chicken Thai, with yummy coconut and mushrooms.

Sweet potato chips could be a little thinner, not as crispy as a chip should be. The dipping sauce is good, sour cream base with some cayenne pepper for a nice kick.

The place was busy, but tables clear fast. Staff was freindly and very in tune to personal service. 

Highly recommended lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Oh oh. The Holy Grill is becoming a habit for lunch. There are some things going for it: free parking, quick service, great food and a personable staff.

The farmhouse and mr.chicken are regular selections - and I almost forgot that some added sirachi adds some kick to the experience."}
{"text":"Went back after sometime but this time for a breakfast. It's wasn't the best wasn't the worst. It was nice to go somewhere downtown for breakfast and not run into lineups, long waits and hungry people though, so that's a bonus. 

Overall it's good, I'd still try it again, third times the charm right?"}
{"text":"Great paninis!  We had a group lunch and the paninis were brought in.  I had the Italian and the Pacific.  The Italian, for me, lacked some spice.  I would prefer if there was roasted red peppers as well as tomato slices.  
I really like the Pacific 'cos of the mixture of flavours of the smoked salmon, artichokes, capers, red onion and spinach.  It combined really well and was fantastic!  

I would like to try their breakfast items one day."}
{"text":"Now, everyone rants and raves about The Holy Grill because they do good burgers and great panini at reasonable prices. 

Did you know The Holy Grill also does breakfast? Well, they do and just as well as lunch too.

There's breakfast burgers, breakfast paninis and eggs benedict. 

Splitting our morning meal between the Hot Chick panini (eggs, hot peppers, tomatoes and spinach in lieu of the cappicola ham) and the Pacific benny (2 poached eggs, smoked salmon, spinach, holy grill, english muffin and hash browns) we were filled before 9am. 

Not to mention some hot, fresh coffee and being in and out in less than 30mins for under $25 and you have an awesome breakfast spot that also *is never busy*.

In a city of constant breakfast line-ups it was a total relief to not have to wait for ... anything. 

Take note, they're open M-Saturday and are closed Sundays. Plus, there's FREE PARKING in their lot (yes, free!) and a patio for the weather resistant.

Feel free to grab a fast and fresh breakfast from Holy Grill. 

Just don't tell too many people and ruin it for the rest of us ok?"}
{"text":"I lucked out both times coming here. I don't particularly like ordering at the counter because it can become a bit chaotic if there's a line up. The place is very small and squishy so be prepared to squeeze by or uncomfortably touch other customers here. The menu is small so that only means everything on it must be yummy!

First time here I ordered eggs benedict and they were seriously better than OEB!! Say wha??? 

The second time I was craving some eggs benny again but alas, they only served breakie 'til 11am!!! (Cry!) I had to settle for a panini which was really quite good actually. I warn you though, the panini is really filling. I was only able to finish half and took the rest home with me. The fries are good and I also had the soup of the day, tomato bisque. Yum! 

Next time I'm in the area before 11am I'm definitely coming for the eggs benny!!"}
{"text":"Nice play on words Holy Grill!

Today with the sudden impending snow and colder weather, my cousin and I huddled for warmth and a good breakfast at the Grail.  I mean the Grill.  With the light snowfall and the view of MEC across the street one could even imagine themselves being at a mountain chalet.

The waitress was top notch, polite, quick and courteous, we ordered two Pacific Benedict, which is the usual suspect plus a nice portion of salmon.  They had actually brought us two regular Bennys, apologised for the mix up... but it was truly worth the wait.  Let me just say they were perfect, the poached eggs were done exquisitely, both holding their forms; and with the hint of lemon in the salmon and hollandaise sauce it was magnifique!

The highlight of my meal however was the potato wedges/chips that came with the meal.  Nice and crunchy, not oily. I could come in, just order a bag of these, sit in the corner and I would truly be a happy camper.

The space is really nice too, it is a small breakie place but done up just right, the grill to the right when you walk in, with the cafe space to the left, done up with beige colours, artwork and black covered tables.  Pretty simple but looking nice and elegant.  I would definitely come back and try something else here and recommend you do too.  Holy Grill is the Holy Grail."}
{"text":"It's just that I had higher expectations. This place is in an excellent location and even has it's own Iphone APP (How cool is that!)
They seemed to know half of the patrons there, who seemed to be regulars. but depsite these impressive facts the quality of the burger we had was nothing special at all.
Another disappointing thing was the floor under our table was covered in food and garbage, which gave me the feeling of eating in a cheap roadside diner."}
{"text":"Wow.

This place is such a neat spot to check out in Calgary.  You order at the counter, find a table and grab your food when the buzzer sounds.

Simple and easy.

The paninis are pretty amazing, so you can't go wrong there.  Not sure what the craze is about the yam fries / chips though.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Since this review is going to be overwhelmingly positive, I'll start with the only down side.  The eating area is very small.  Its pretty unlikely that you'll have a place to sit down when you go so be prepared to take away.

Now onto the good stuff.  The food quality is excellent, the prices are fair, and the staff are friendly.  They clean tables quickly when people do finally leave and there's no shortage of napkins or ketchup.  This is a great place to pop into on for a quick downtown lunch!"}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict and Bacon Crisp were both great! Coming from America, it has been hard coming to Calgary as brunch spots are hard to find. This place had friendly counter service, clean tables, and great breakfast! We will definitely be back next time we are here."}
{"text":"What a delicious breakfast and busy little restaurant! I love that you can get both breakfast and lunch at the same time for I am a breakfast person and bf is definitely a typical guy, he loves his burgers. I would come back to this place in a heart beat.

I don't like hasbrowns usually but I liked these ones so definitely make sure you try them! My eggs benedict was great, I gobbled it all up. 

This is a pretty trendy place, more of an upscale \"fast food\" joint. I use the term \"fast food\" loosely because the food is way better than any fast food place. You may have to fight for a place to sit though it's pretty popular here! 

I can't wait to come back to Calgary so I can go to this place again!"}
{"text":"by far the best burger i have EVER had! and I should know my meat..im from texas...but something about the way this burger is cooked ---its just perfection! now i just did the standard \"original\" burger...but im sure if you go more exotic with it..you cant go wrong...fries were a tad soggy but still a great a compliment to the burger! definitely a must visit if you are in the area! 5 stars ALL the way! ...ohh and i forgot to mention the guys behind the counter were super friendly and easy on the eyes (: but stellar service for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh Holy Grill, how is it that even after four years of frequenting you for lunches, you still get it right. EVERY SINGLE DAMN TIME! You've got panini world down to a mad science. Your line moves quickly. Your booming voices ensure no one misses their order once its ready.

You were the very first business I ever reviewed on Yelp, and so I figured it was time for an update.

I just had to stop in again today for a bite to eat. It's typical of me to be in here with friends, I gotta share the love. And on such occasions, we usually split an order of yam chips as well. But today, I was on the go. And so a country side panini was all I could handle. Capricciosa ham and provolone cheese. It's a simply sammy, but perfect for something to keep me going the rest of the afternoon.

What I STILL haven't been in for is breakfast. But don't worry, I'll make sure I change that very soon!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot in the heart of uptown Calgary. The food is a collection of unique panini's, burgers and salads that range from hearty meat blends or light veggie delights. 

The staff are fabulous and are always chatting patrons up while they wait for their breakfast or lunch. 

Be sure to get there in good time or after the lunch rush in order to get a seat cuase it's not just the food that's a hot commodity at the Holy Grill.

{"text":"On my free day in Calgary decided to try this place as it was very well like on yelp. Maybe I am a bit difficult but it was not a 4.5* expérience for me. I had the egg benedict and the présentation was just great but that where it stop. The patatos had no sesonning therefor were bland. The eggs were cook to perfecrion but the sauce was again bland. I like it to be creamy and rich. As I was sitting I saw a few plate pass by and they all look good. i hope those have taste.  Coffee is bottomless but like everything else it is a self serve.  I would try something else on the menu next time if I am back in town."}
{"text":"ordered: Avocado bacon crisp sandwich and pacific eggs benedict.

All was good but I preferred the avocado bacon crisp sandwich over the eggs benedict, though the smashed hashbrowns were delicious!  ( side note: the best eggs benny I have eaten so far is still the one I had in Canmore)   :)

Staff are super friendly, nice, and accommodating.
I didn't know how the system worked and there wasn't a waitress / hostess around and so I sat down and waited for my friend (just following what a few others had done).  Then within 5 mins it became super busy and a waitress/hostess appeared and kindly told me how the place functions and that I should order first before sitting as people who have ordered now have no place to sit.  I was ready to give up our table but she was kind and insisted that I stay.   It all ended well as others were leaving and everyone got a table.  She then felt bad an apologized (which was SUPER nice of her cuz I wasn't insulted and it wasn't her fault - she was just doing her job!).  So here's the drill: Order and pay at the grill, you will get a vibrating coaster and when a seat or hostess is avail you get a table and wait for your coaster to vibrate and then you pick up your food at the grill.  Utensils, napkins, and water are on the side wall - again self service.  

When I eat in smaller restaurants *cough*  blue star diner *cough*  I often feel cramped and claustrophobic and that I'm eavesdropping on my neighbors conversation but for some reason today I did not feel this way despite the small space. The high ceilings are nice too and probably help.

4 giant stars. II would come back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best drop by spots in Calgary. You never have to wait long for your food or a table (even when they are super busy). They are really friendly and the menu is delightful! My favourite is the bacon avocado sandwich. I think it's supposed to be a breakfast item (has a perfectly fried egg in it) but is perfect for lunch too!"}
{"text":"The food was good, loved the potatoes:) the only reason I'm not giving the extra star is because of the way service works...I know a lot of restaurant are getting this pay and receive a buzzer thing but I just don't like the feeling of being in a McDonald when seeking exactly the opposite...anyway.

Other then that it was very good :D"}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie panini- it was more of a crispy burrito.  Not bad- but not my favorite meal.  But quality of ingredients was good."}
{"text":"Holy Grill always the best!!! Fast and yummy!! People nice!! Always good for the brunch!! 
Never disappoints!!! Highly recommend?"}
{"text":"Food is good Benedict wakey wakey! Coffee not bad, but self service to order and get coffee! They bring food to table service is great, breakfast was over and they accommodated me! So if you are wanting breakfast come before 11!! Was not crowded, I think we will try other location on 5 ave to compare!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Location! Must haves are the Brunch Burger and the South Beach Benny! Absolutely loved it! Keep in mind that you do go up to the window to order you're food but this was a great experience! I'd go back! We were craving it the next day too!! For more tips checkout my blog at www.katrinaxavier.com"}
{"text":"Only reason this is getting a 4 rather than a 5-star review is that the place is tiny and cramped. We waited 20 minutes to get a table for 2. The food is delicious though. The place has a hipster feel."}
{"text":"I would give this a 4 if the food was better tasting. It's all self-serve and order is ready in no time. It is by far the blandest tasting breakfast I've ever had. I mean it's breakfast. It was well presented and portion was OK. It a pretty happening place, while I was there a line started form. The weather was great, so the patio was in use! Brunch is one of my favorite meal and I was a bit disappointed that this place didn't deliver a flavourful meal given its prices."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great, the food is and the service attitude.
The Holly grillers make you feel welcome, every time !"}
{"text":"I'm so thankful that there's free parking for patrons beside the building.  That alone makes it more enticing to drive here, despite the distance from my house.  The food and its presentation is fabulous, considering the casual atmosphere.  The presentation was not something I was expecting, especially because of the protocol with ordering your meal and the help yourself situation with the coffee and condiments.  It totally works for this place and I'm glad they've kept the seating capacity down to a minimum.  It helps to maintain The Holy Grill's exclusivity.  

What made me smile is the fact that during my first visit a few weeks ago, someone in my party had tipped them off that it was my birthday and the staff actually made an effort to acknowledge it, even though we were there for a low key, early morning breakfast.  It's the little things and this is why I want to go back."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice for lunch, and on weekends, so I really don't have an idea how crowded it gets with the business crowd during the week. On Saturday around noon, the place is hopping, but you should have no problem finding a table.

I'm a burger guy, so I dispensed with the wraps/paninis and went straight for the good stuff. The first time, I had the Original Burger, and the second, the Ranch Burger or something, both times, it was quickly and well-prepared. They are generous on the garnishes as well, plenty of fresh lettuce, tomatoes, etc... They also have a Veggie Burger on the menu, for those of us not inclined to sampling the flesh of the lesser species.

The prices are also not very high, considering the trendiness of this place. Burgers run from $6.50-$8.00 and fries is an extra $3.25. That's competitive even with trashy fast food. What's more, the staff is very friendly,  and tables are clean (clear your own dishes, please!).

Also, there is parking in the back, lots of parking. I don't know, I started off this review kind of impartial, but as I reflected on my two experiences here, my craving for finely seared ground beef has basically overwhelmed my thinking process.

Go here, go often, even if you're not living or working in the neighbourhood. They are licensed, and wine is $5 a glass."}
{"text":"Italian paninis are awesome here. I haven't tried anything else yet because these are too good"}
{"text":"I have been here three times now so safe to say that I LOVE this place. The portions are huge, the food is delicious, and the breakfast is also tasty. The only things I don't like about it are: 1) the line to order can easily get unweildy and confusing, so just be aware of that during the lunch rush and 2)they have super limited hours. Both of those things, though, are totally understandable and the food is so good that I will still give this place 5-stars. 

This is a sandwich/burger place in the best way possible. Everything is made on a grill and is made to order. The menu features a variety of burgers (veggie included) with a creative and traditional toping list. I have had the traditional burger, a roast beef panini and the eggs benedict (with salmon). I have also had both the regular fries and the sweet potato chips. Everything was delicious and fresh. I cannot wait to go back and sample the beet chips. 

This isn't necessarily the sort of place where you go with a large group, I must say. The tables can be pushed together, but seating is pretty limited so it can be a challenge. I would, however, recommend this place either for a quick lunch or brunch any day of the week."}
{"text":"I have been to The Holy Grill a few times now and it has yet to disappoint me or anyone in my party. Go for breakfast or lunch, pick absolutely anything on the menu, and enjoy. The brunch burger and the eggs benedict are my two favorite dishes on the menu. I will definitely be going back to The Holy Grill in the future."}
{"text":"Amaaaaazing food! The classic eggs benny was great. There isn't a whole lot of selection, so if you have a picky eater dining with you I wouldn't recommend it. But the food and service is overall great, not to mention you can see them cook your meal so you feel pretty good about the cooks."}
{"text":"Love the great staff and tasty food here. The portions are generous and consistently fresh. My go to lunch place in the Beltline."}
{"text":"I do wonder about this place sometimes. I think the issue comes with consistency - one time I will have a DELICIOUS panini, but the same panini will be very subpar the next time I come. I think overall the food is good, but the consistency needs a little bit of work. I would definitely try it out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast sandwich with pickles. And it was absolutely amazing. Different to anything I've had before. People that work there are all super friendly, and it was a nice chill atmosphere. 100% would return."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I got the breakfast burger and it was ok. Best thing was the fries. The other item we ordered was a bacon avocado crisp and it was halt out gross. Wife couldn't eat it and when I tried I couldn't either. Bummer. Also they don't have any breakfast items like pancakes or French toast. Just a lot of meat heavy dishes. Want to love it. But I couldn't."}
{"text":"Mmm, mmm, mmm!  Holy Grill is a great lunch place with delicious food and wonderful service.  I'd always heard people talk about it and finally decided to head there myself.

Sapna G. speaks no word of a lie.  This place truly does have some of the nicest people I've ever encountered at a restaurant.  It seems the employees are always trying to make everyone's experience as pleasurable as possible, and they really pull it off.  It's nice to see a bunch of workers who don't hate their lives.

The thing I loved most about the Holy Grill was the beet chips.  I was a little hesitant to try them, since they look weird and purplish, but they turned out to be so scrumptious!  I also love that most of their burgers come with two patties... that's right, TWO patties!  I skeptically tried the \"Gourmet Burger\" when I went.  I say skeptically because there was blue cheese and I've never been a fan... but I wanted the avocado so I went for it.  I was surprised that, unlike other blue cheese meals, the taste wasn't too overpowering and actually gave it a nice taste.

I'll be going back to Holy Grill to try some other food.  I had such a difficult time making up my mind last time because everything seemed like it would be so delicious and really hit the spot.  And, for a well-sized meal for under $10, how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Price: a little on the high end for amount of food.
Food Quality: was good/ok I had the wakey wakey and the eggs were cooked well. The hash browns tasted as if they had been sitting around a while then were quickly warmed up. 
Location: it was a neat little spot a little crowded inside with a bit of a hipster vibe."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long time. Pacific bennies are incredible. And smashed potatoes...they are perfect. Two thumbs up for the staff too. Really friendly guys."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Let me get that out of the way first. I had the brunch burger and my friend had the pacific salmon. The reason for my rating is based purely on experience. when we came in the (what I thought was a) \"server\" handed me two menus gestured to the dining area and said to sit at any table behind the wall, so we did and sat down. It wasn't obvious that it was a seat yourself concept and then order at the counter. There were signs above but they weren't obviously placed and the \"server\" was a bus boy. So after figuring it out because we had sat for a while with no acknowledgment we went to order our food and they were all really friendly but while waiting in line the bus boy kept passing us with dirty dishes \"excuse me\" \"excuse me\" because the line to order was in the way of the bus boys path. The kitchen was placed in the wrong place. At the order station the staff was very friendly. But they asked for a tip on the debit machine and I was like \"uh tip\" there has been no service yet because there is no server and we haven't even tasted he food yet so why am I tipping?  They had one order taker and one bus boy (maybe two). I would have switched the order taker and the bus boy into two servers instead or change the layout of the restaurant to make it more obvious. I want them to do well because of the food but the concept was not executed well from a service perspective."}
{"text":"Love this place!! You can't go wrong whether it's Breakfast, lunch or brunch. The staff are always cheerful, the food is delicious, and service is fast. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here Saturday around 11 and it was busy but we were still able to be seated right away for our party of 5. If you're looking for a quick brunch place on a Saturday this is the place. We loved all the food we got. Loved their homemade hashbrown, they are quite crispy so be aware of that , my my husband didn't care for them too much because of that. Can't wait to come back and try the avocado Benedict!"}
{"text":"Like Rodney Dangerfield, I feel like this place doesn't get no respect. It has great Yelp reviews, but I don't hear people talking about it on the mean streets of Calgary very often.

It's a shame, because it is consistently fantastic. They specialize in paninis and burgers, but I've never been able to bring myself to order a burger because every panini I've had has been incredible and I don't want to mess with perfection. That's the sign of a place that gets it right.

My wife is even more hardcore than me. She only ever orders the Mr. Chicken panini. Filled with delicious chicken, bacon, tomato and crack, it is so amazing. Most recently, I had a Californian - filled with cream cheese, artichokes, bell peppers and crack. It was juicy, and succulent, dripping with the magical crack juice. 

There is something so fresh, delicious, and mouth watering about these paninis. You know you just couldn't replicate it at home. It must be the crack. Order the sweet potato chips to go with it your sandwich, they are also to die for.

In addition, the prices are ridiculously reasonable. An $8 panini here is more delicious than a $14 burger at pretty much any pub in the city.

My wife couldn't finish her Mr. Chicken yesterday and brought half of it home. After writing this review, my mouth is watering and I can hear it calling me from the fridge. But I better not put my marriage at risk."}
{"text":"We went on a weekend for breakfast and I was super judgmental about the small space.   The food makes up for the \"cozy\" atmosphere however.  I'd call it, upscale dining in a shack.    

Their eggs benny is to die for, so this yelper is willing to get close to her neighbours in order to eat here again."}
