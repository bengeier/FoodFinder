{"text":"Terrible service. The price of the menu didn't reflect the actual price, the man at the register told me the menu was old! Yet it was still in place taped to the counter? Once done the chicken wings were no bigger than my thumb to say the least, with minimal flavor. To top it off my friend bought a drink from the convenience store next door and we were prompt kicked out of the restaurant. It was better leaving the restaurant it was filthy and outdated."}
{"text":"THEY MOVED!!!   @ One point the had the best wings ever now this place is ughhh...the end"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the typical chinese/west Indian dishes. This is not really a place to sit down and have dinner with family as it is quite small.. Also, as the bar part of Soca palace is adjacent, with thin walls to the dining part it can get rowdy at times. I recommend ordering for parties (they offer huge trays for average prices) or take out.  The combos they offer are fairly priced with generous portions (as they sometimes overfill the take out box), they are satisfying. My family of four orders two rice and noodle combos and there are usually some left overs. The chow mien and Lou mien are quite tasty, the rice is tasty and a typical fried rice. The fried chicken wings at this place is AMAZING! sometimes they can be a bit oily but they are so crispy, tasty and juicy!!  Free parking, they accept debit and credit card, service is average."}
