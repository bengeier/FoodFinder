{"text":"Allow me to express my undying love for New Orleans Take-Out.   I lived in Madison almost 8 years ago and have yet to find another shrimp po' boy even remotely close to the delicacy at NOTO. It's one of those hole in the wall places that looks scary and not hygienic on the outside but is completely amazing and totally worth it.   I remember the first time my dad took me for a \"sandwich as big as yo head.\" I had just taken the ACT as a 6th grader and afterwards all I was really capable of was mumbling simple sentences. I remember being surprised that dad wasn't kidding, the sandwich really was as big as my head. And that it was like, really awesome. My fam were instantly regulars.  8 years and 3 citites later, the search continues. I'm not even asking for a better sandwich (I don't think one exists), but one that's just as good (it seems like that doesn't exist either).  Oh and if this review sounds similar to the one by Sheena F. it's because she's my sister. It's a family obsession."}
{"text":"So much on the menu, I wish I could have tried more.  I made the decision to go with a half order and should have gone with the full.  The beans are amazing - I ran into a some great flavors. The rice is just right not mushy not hard.  The french bread is yum, though I personally could use heaps of butter on it. Good mercy this red beans and rice with sausage is good.   I wish I had found this place sooner.    Prices are reasonable too.   4 *'s because it's my first time there and \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" Hope to make it 5 after the next visit."}
{"text":"Ever since my husband (native to Madison) took me here, I always make several trips out from Chicago every year... otherwise my cravings for the Shrimp Creole, Red Beans and Rice with double sausage, Gumbo, Chicken Po' Boy, Jambalaya, and really anything else Roussos has got goin' on that day....will cause me to go into NOTO withdrawal. Oh! And who can forget the Panola hot sauce he uses! There is so much soul in this food and super flavor, but really it's Roussos' own personal touch that makes it so unique. The food is truly special. So get yo' self out to NOTO but make sure to bring your appetite!"}

{"text":"I love how this is situated at the interception of Monroe, Randall and Regent, super convenient whether you are going from campus or after a football match or grocery shopping at Trader Joe's. It is a small and cozy place, with a handful of seats, so most people order ahead and take it to go. I especially love the seats by the window, enjoying my food while seeing the world pass by.   This place serves great New Orleans food, comparable to the ones I had at New Orleans itself when I was there for a conference. Love their oyster dishes (oyster dinner). Their classic New Orleans dishes such as creole, etouffee and dirty rice are extremely spicy, exactly as advertized on the menu, and this is coming from someone who has tried some pretty spicy food. So try it only if you have a very high tolerance for spicy stuff, or if you are feeling really adventurous that day, you have been warned ~~~  One thing I like to do is to have the half dirty rice with half white rice with my orders. That way you get the spiciness and flavors of dirty rice but it doesn't overdo the spices. They cater to small eaters as well -- order the half size. Or get the full order, then you don't have to worry about your next meal.   To sum up, their caption says it all -- EAT MO BETTAH!!"}
{"text":"back in my younger days of bakery, I worked at the bakery that supplied NOTO with french bread.   It had to be a certain length, a certain crust, and a certain color if it wasn't......................YIKES!!  I figured if he had such a high standard of quality for his bread, that the same mind of detail would apply to his food, and I was right., I used to eat at his restuarant faithfully every week.....then i moved :(  I was in town so I stopped in on friday for some lunch.  The food was excellent.   I ordered the fried fish with sauce pecan meuniere and the fried cod po' boy.   The bread was ok (I stand by the bread we used to make years ago....it was just perfect), the fish was fried to perfection and the lettuce, tomato, and pickle were just right.    as for the fried fish with the pecan sauce,   I got a half order.  wasn't enough.  I had forgotten just how great the sauce with the rice and the fish really were.      Go here for some great food."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment.  Used to be a regular and had not been in a while but was in a mardi gras mood.  Cornbread burned, the rice in the red beans and rice was undercooked and everything else beside the greens was only average. Ruined my mardi gras food mood and will not retun."}
{"text":"That was the worst meal we have ever gotten there...we have pictures of the aweful chicken with white rice and creole sause...the sauce was just tomatoes sauce with some hot sauce...we have never gotten such small wings ever.  We order once a week, and this is just not what we expect...John what is going on here?"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"1/2 order of crawfish\"-got the equivalent of cup of rice and about a half a cup of fried crawfish for ...$8.95 YIKES!  Also ordered the red beans & rice 1/2 order, same 1 cup of rice, 1/2 cup beans.  I know it says \"1/2 order\", but for the price the half order is not even a side dish.   The shrimp Po'Boy was lackluster to say the least. The shrimp wasn't even fried, nowhere close to authentic.   The \"16 ounce\" lemonade was not \"16 ounces\" and was served in a to-go coffee cup.   Will not be going back. The price doesn't match the quality.  Wasn't anything outstanding."}
{"text":"Been to New Orleans...this place is just as good as anything there.  Today's shrimp in cream sauce was outstanding."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review about this place for a long time.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Hands down.  Both locations serve the same menu but I go to the one on Monroe Street because of my work location and convenience.  The po' boys are some of the best things on the menu:  shrimp or oyster or chicken or catfish....   Great crunchy bread with a little bit of mayo, tomatoes, and pickles.... The po' boys here rock!  The entrees are great too.  I usually get a half order of the entrees with corn bread and a side of collard greens.  That's more than enough food to fill a person up.  The ingredients are fresh.  All the dinners are made fresh in the kitchen by Ken Kopp, grandson of the owner of the now closed grocery store, Ken Kopps on Monroe Street. (If you've been around long enough,  you might remember that Ken Kopps grocery used to be on the location where the Trader Joe's and the condominiums are now on Monroe Street.)  I suggest either starting with one of their po' boy sandwiches-- if you like shrimp, try that-- or a standard is the red beans & rice with sausage with cornbread on the side.  if you get the red beans & rice w/ sausage dinner,  I'd also suggest having them hold the hot sauce.  Then when you eat,  you can put the hot sauce on the way you like it with as much or as little as you like.  Ken keeps a good collection of some interesting hot sauces!  I love this place!  A dinner or a po' boy goes for around $10, give or take, without a soda."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places to grab something delicious to go. I usually enjoy their cod po boy which is delicious every time I get it. The bread and fillings are fresh, full of piping hot and freshly fried fish. The food is always consistently delicious and flavorful. My boyfriend is a fan of their blackened catfish with their special sauce over rice. Also wonderfully seasoned as the creole rice is to die for. It is a little slice of cajun food amongst the general population of burgers that Madison has to offer. If you're craving something different yet hearty, this is your place to go."}
{"text":"I've always meant to order from  here, but I used to go to New Orleans so often that it's never been pressing issue. Finally, one day the cravings got to us, so we tried the place out.  The place was exceptionally easy to order from. They don't play 1,000 questions with you, which is nice. The menu is easy to find online if you don't have a paper copy.   I admit, when I picked up our order and got it home, we were slightly dismayed at the quantity. We ordered two dishes for three people. We spend a lot of time in the Big Easy and have become accustomed to ordering from the locals' joints which cater to the service people. Large portions, cheap prices.   Then we tasted it. We had the large trio (combination of a few things) and it was so good -- the flavors were great, the stuff was actually spicy, and I found I could love jambalaya (normally not a fan).  We also go a shrimp po'boy -- I was so excited that it tasted almost exactly at the one we get from our normal go-to place in the Quarter.   While the quantity was less than we expected, the quality was superior to what we get at our little dive joints. You can definitely see they emphasize flavor and texture, rather than giving you a week's worth of food. That works for me -- we were all full off our dishes and very happy."}
{"text":"I had the red beans and white rice with cornbread, dirty rice, fries. Not quite what my granny used to make. But the dirty rice was spicy and I added it to the bland white rice and beans to add flavor to it. It was ok buy upset my stomach. Cornbread was dense and moist? Flavorless though. I wanted some warm buttery cornbread goodness. Nope. The fries and bbq sauce was all I liked in my order."}
{"text":"I literally walked and biked by this place everyday for 2 years before restaurant boredom brought me in here on a warm April Friday evening. I got the fish fry special on a whim, even though the woman at the front recommended a 3-piece sampler of some sort.  It was amazing. 2 long and lean pieces of fried fish. No fishy off flavor - fresh and delicious. It was topped with some sort of butter pecan glaze including fresh pecans. To top it off I also got a cup of New England clam chowder which was also totally legit.  Having lived in the deep south for 10 years, I was very surprised to find this sort of quality in a place I'd passed over so many times. You truly can't judge a book by its cover. I'll be back here very soon, now I want to try to po boy!.  Update 6/2016: Still awesome. I go here at least once at week now. Know almost the entire menu. The food is consistently amazing. Shrimp Po Boy is really the thing to get if you're undecided. It has a snap to it! The garlic and creole sauces as extra up-charge options are worth consideration for most orders. Cod and Pecan special on Fridays is also a fav. This is my favorite restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. Thought i'd give it try based on the ratings. Im originally from the south so i was a little aprehensive about trying it, but thankfully i was totally suprised! Husband had the red beans n rice with smoked sausage, i had the shrimp creole and we got a half order of wings. Everything was excellent and very authentic. Although i will warn you, it is not for those with sensitive mouths! Cajun is spicy food and this def lived up to that! Will be going back"}
{"text":"First time to try creole cuisine turned into 3 successive evening meals courtesy of NOTO. Absolutely love this place. The Mardi Gras combo, seafood combo, shrimp , steamed greens and sausage are all excellent. And don't forget the delicious cornbread!! So filling, super tasty and great value. The staff are all really friendly too."}
{"text":"Ok. I should've read deeper because it is a Vegan dirty rice. Having that pointed out to me, then I retract what I said about it. Doesn't change my live for the real one though."}
{"text":"I've gone to NOTO three times in about 3 weeks and there is a good reason why I've been going back.  Ever since I went to new orleans a few years ago, I have been searching for good New Orleans style food.  I have definitely found it here.  Everything looks great coming out of the kitchen, but I enjoy having a little bit of everything so I get the mardi grad combo.  Really great.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I moved away from Madison about a year ago and having grown up in California never liked most of the bland food from Wisconsin... with a few exceptions.  New Orleans Take-Out is at the top of that list. The food is incredible... better than anything I had the week I spent in New Orleans; The Jambalaya, Red beans and rice, and especially the Shrimp Creole. Hell, they even have the best potato salad I've ever tasted.  I spent a month playing with my Shrimp Creole recipe trying to get it to taste like Roussos'... I'm close, but not quite there.  So any time you are in Madison you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't treat yourself to some creole on the prairie."}
{"text":"Talk about authentic...the true mark of an extraordinary po-boy is the texture of the French Bread.  A-plus!  Juicy oysters, fried to perfection, dressed with just the right balance of lettuce, tomato, mayo.  I even got to listen to KGNU Jazz while I waited!  The only drawback was they were out of spicy cajun crawtators!  I'm looking forward to going back and trying all the daily specials, but so far they've earned the best review possible"}
{"text":"Pathetic. Red beans and rice with sausage was the most bland I've ever had, even asked for it to be made spicy. Apparently they can't afford cayenne since its so darn expensive. Looked like diarrhea on white rice. The \"sausage\" was paper thin and may have well not even existed. Apparently andouille sausage is prohibitively expensive as well. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Authentic New Orleans fare.  Jambalaya is flavorful. The Mardi Gras Combo is awesome:  shrimp creole, jambalaya, red beans & rice.  I have also had the catfish which is crazy good and would like to try one of their po' boys one of these days."}
{"text":"I would say the food isn't too bad but not a blown away, and portion is too small.   My first language isn't English and don't grow up here so the menu is all greek for me.  I asked a couple questions and the guy was already pretty impatient, where there wasn't anyone but me and my husband(hey next time when you go to China, try reading Chinese menu and order FAST!!! Oh I forgot, they don't speak English to you). THis is very different from most of my dining experiences in the US where people are pretty friendly and willing to help and explain. Were it not my husband there who knew what's going on, I probably would have just walked away.  The food is decently good.  I had shrimp in very spicy tomato sauce (shrimp étouffée) and did like it a lot. Extremely spicy but I like it."}
{"text":"SO good. Everything is amazing from the po boys to the jambalaya.  I can't even make a recommendation just get what you like cause its all so damn good."}
{"text":"Oh the weather outside is frightful, but the shrimp étouffée was so delightful... I have been in Madison a bunch recently for work and will miss it solely because I won't get my shrimp étouffée and corn bread anymore!  I found this place when I was staying at the hotel next door.  The next time I came out to Madison I was staying in Middleton but still had to make the trip to get my fix.  I got the jambalaya here too and that was also amazing but it's just difficult to put into words the flavor of the étouffée.  It has the perfect amount of spicy in it without tasting overdoing it like a lot of hot sauces and spicy things you get these days.  Absolutely perfect meal. Amazing flavor.. Couldn't ask for more!  I'll probably come back tomorrow. Seriously.."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go for some New Orleans today.  We had been there so long ago that we couldn't really remember what the food was like.  We both had the Oyster Po' Boys and they were delicious.  When I first saw it I was thinking that it was way too much bread for the amount of oysters, but it doesn't matter if the bread is great.  It was very soft and the very top was crispy.  There was just a slight flavor so the taste of the oysters came through.    The sweet potatoes fries were as good as anyone's except for another restaurant I've reviewed.  The potato salad was good ( I was told ) and the corn bread was flavorful, but a little on the dry side.  I got a piece of the sweet potato pecan pie, but didn't have enough room in the belly for it (yet).  Overall, the food was done well, fast, and flavorful."}
{"text":"We had the special of the day, Monday's are not real exciting, so my fiancé had the double sausage red beans and white rice with a choice of French or Corn bread. I had the single sausage with red beans and white rice, corn bread. DELICIOUS! We had to take home an extra pc. of Corn Bread! It was early aft. so not too busy. Cashier/Waitress was very friendly and energetic and both her and the cook delivered our food and bread to us!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent service and food. This has now long surpassed the original location.  The food rivals what you would get in New Orleans, and is better than the touristy places there.  A real Madison gem."}
{"text":"I came here on a day that I was feeling really crappy, and this place really helped! First off, they have really nice staff who are willing to answer all your questions and get to know you.  Second, the food is really good.  I ordered the crab cakes and the crawfish etouffee (half orders for both).  The crab cakes were soft, flavorful, and came with a delicious sauce.  The Etouffee is listed as very very hot, but I have a really high spice tolerance so it was okay in terms of spiciness, but still very flavorful.  The rice is great quality too.  Finally, I got a praline, and OH MY GOSH what a great way to end my meal.  It was soft, chewy, and absolutely delicious.  They've got great service, it's fast, and delicious! One recommendation, though, is to order the full portions instead of the half.  The half is nice for a light meal, but I wish I had more. Hehe"}
{"text":"Since this is my very first review, I hope not to begin a trend of writing negative reviews, but I was extremely disappointed with New Orleans Takeout. I had high expectations for this place as it has a reputation for and portrays itself as being highly authentic.   We had 4 dishes; Jambalaya, Shrimp Creole, Fried Chicken and Catfish Po Boys.  Jambalaya was too thick. They managed to over and undercook the rice at the same time. I have no clue how this was possible! The rice was both runny and crunchy."}
{"text":"The only downside is the limited eating area (hence the name \"take-out\").  Parking is not so great either.  But the food is excellent!  I got yhr small Madri Gra plate for lunch which included red beans,shrimp and jambalaya.  Everything was spiced nicely and steaming fresh.  A real treat for the taste buds."}
{"text":"Reminiscent of our recent NOLA trip I couldn't stand going one more day without some Creole food.   We ordered the 1/2 jambalaya,  1/2 Creole shrimp, full order of the Friday cod special, and two pralines. All for total of $30.  The jambalaya was very heavily tomato based, with pieces of tender cubes chicken,  ham,  chunks of celery and tomato. I favour the jambalaya from Vertie Marte in NOLA.  The Creole shrimp had generous portion of shrimp with a savory Cajun tomato sauce.   The cod was a single piece of cod drizzled with a buttery sauce and pecans. My partner remarked it was definitely a single serving,  not a big portion but enough for a individual who isn't starving.   The cornbread and pralines were the stars here. The cornbread came with each entree, were sweet,  crumbly, with a crusty outer layer. The pralines were a hit, just as good as the Southern Candymakers.  We'd definitely like to return to try the po boys or other mouthwatering offerings."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place. Make It stop. Too real & too good. Today was the glorious day that I got to try for the first time. I don't even know what I got I think it was the mardi gras combo...SO GOOD. The spice was on point & the best part was the corn bread!!! I've lived in the south for 6 years hating corn bread. But let me tell you about their corn bread, freaking moist, sweet and AWESOME. I'm coming back soon whether you like it or not."}
{"text":"If you like spicy Cajun this is the perfect spot. I ordered the crawfish étouffée and a side of dirty rice to go. It was phenomenal. My mouth is still tingling while I write this review. Look forward to sampling another item or two from their menu while I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time and it was great. Owner was friendly and the food was great. I ordered a crawfish poboy and the spicy chicken jambalaya. Both were top grade and addictive. The jazz that was playing was a nice touch while waiting. The open kitchen made it feel like home, where you can see your food being prepared. I am so coming back...a lot."}
{"text":"After living a hop, skip, and a jump from this place for the last 6 months, I decided to give it a try. Due to my indecision, I went for the Mardi Gras combo because of the options available.  I ordered a half order, and it was more than enough food for one person. This combo consisted of beans, white rice, jambalaya, shrimp creole, and the cornbread that is made in house.  It was certainly a filling meal, and I enjoyed the consistency of the rice and beans. The jambalaya was a little underwhelming and wasn't as hot in temperature as I would have liked, but the other components really made up for it. The shrimp creole had a moderately spicy sauce, and the shrimp were super juicy. You could definitely tell that the corn bread was made in house and was a nice sweet palate cleanser.  Next time I come back, I intend on trying a po boy or one of their seafood place because I feel like I ate the beginner's round this time, and their menu has some decent variety."}
{"text":"New Orleans Take Out is all around greatness.  I absolutely love this place and everything on the menu.  When I was a kid the best times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back.  It was always such a great surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right away you could smell those spices!  Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  It really is the best outside of the Gulf.  I really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite.  The po' boys are without exception great.  The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich.  It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite.  The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible.  This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped.  The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on.  Same for the shrimp etouffee.  The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food.  Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.    I've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building.  I call ahead whenever I plan to stop, but about half the time it is straight up impulse that brings me there.  No matter whatever else happens that day, it's always a good day if you've been to New Orleans Take Out."}
{"text":"Went here recently after viewing Edgewood College. I had the Mardi Gra Combo-Jambalaya, red beans and rice, and shrimp creole. I have been to New Orleans three times and this food is good and the prices are amazingly reasonable.  Very prompt service too. Only thing I didn't like- someone had put a floor fan too close to where folks walk in- the fan cut my leg- right through my pants. I alerted the gal behind the counter and her reaction was to run to the back of the restaurant, without asking me any questions!.     So- great food, great prices, just watch where and how   you enter the restaurant!"}
{"text":"The prices are obscene they cook in nasty old grease we had the fish and shrimp both were awful and not enough a two year old could prepare better food! We were Very disappointed and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Basically like an expanded food truck. Simple decor with a couple of New Orleans touches. You can see right into the kitchen and the menus are pieces of paper. They really maxed out the space in there with probably 10 spots to sit.  Food: Food tastes very home cooked. Not too fancy, but good flavor. I had the red beans and rice with double sausage and my boyfriend got the gulf shrimp dinner. Pretty sure everything comes with cornbread. The dirty rice was hot (for me at least).   One novelty I had to try was the praline. I had no idea with this was, but apparently it's a New Orleans tradition with butter and sugar and milk and pecans and it kind of tastes like a grainy caramel. Very sweet and delicious. Around $3.50 for one of those babies.   Service: Fast and kind. Not a whole lot of interaction (seeing as it's counter service), but all that we had was good! For the price i think it was a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"I have loved New Orleans Takeout for over twenty years! Ever since a good college friend of mine (Mark) introduced it to me, I was hooked. I used to go to the Fordem Avenue location just about every week when I was living and working downtown. It was always good, cheap food that was ready in minutes. And the Fordem Avenue location was easy to get to and park at.  Now, here I am twenty plus years later and I recently re-discovered the Monroe Street location- yes, I had been there before, but now that my daughter is attending a weeknight soccer camp at UW and I have an hour to kill over the late side of the dinner hour, it is becoming a weekly dinner treat for me.  The last two weeks I have had the half-portion Mardi Gras combo. A good size plate, I cannot imagine what the full size would be. The half is fine for a meal. It comes with Red Beans and Rice (ohhh, so nice!), Shrimp Étouffée and Jambalaya and a  side of corn bread. The corn bread is the best I have ever had (and I will make my own corn bread from scratch from time to time). So moist and snapping with good corn flavor. Definitely not dry. The étouffée contains three or four nice size shrimp nestled in a warm, spicy sauce (but not too spicy- bottles of hot sauce for those who like it really spicy) with the requisite veggies. Jambalaya had good balance with ham/chicken and rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. And the Red Beans and Rice was a real winner, helping to cool down the bite of the étouffée.  Next time I want to try the Oyster Po Boy and Blackened Catfish to see if they are as good as I remember.   Service here is as friendly and laid back as the Big Easy (these guys and women have a genuine smile plastered on their face), but each time has been prompt. Not much room to sit (maybe 8-10 stools on Monroe Street), hence the \"take-out\" designation in the name. Not the most attractive place in the world, but very homey and warm, with great jazz and zydecajun music. And if you eat there there is god people watching out the big windows.  I gave it five stars but in reality 4.5 is more like it. But the great music makes me decide to round it up."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of living a block away from NOTO while in college and I fell in love with the place. Before trying their food I had never eaten Cajun cuisine so all you foodies out there might not want to put stock into my 5 Star Rating. But for me this place is great.  My favorites: I love the red beans and rice with sausage, dirty rice, shrimp dinner, corn bread, and french bread!    My only wish is that they would deliver now that I don't live next door."}
{"text":"I have been trying to get here for a while and it happened. The place doesn't look like much when you drive by and you can miss it.  The inside has a wall of pictures and Is divvy looking with two dining areas. The kitchen is exposed and you can watch your food being prepared, see my pictures.  The menu is not huge but it all sounds good so figuring out what to get was a challenge. I settled on the gulf shrimp po boy with red beans/rice with sausage.  The food came pretty quick and smelled good, see my pictures. The gulf shrimp is hand breaded and cooked to order. The gulf shrimp po boy was very tasty with fresh ingredients and was a good choice. The red beans/rice with smoked was very good. The red beans were in a thick but mild sauce and the grilled smoked sausage was the perfect complement.  This a great cajon place with great food and I can see why it started to get a line while we were there and wait times were going up."}
{"text":"I love this rare New Orleans find in Madison. Yes, most people order ahead and grab their food to go, BUT there are 10-15 bar seats available if you want to have your order fresh and hot. Which is what I usually do.   The place is quick and reliable. Great if you need food on a weekend in a rush. Service is like a fast food joint, order at the cashier, and most of the times they bring out your food.  Alright alright, what to get?  - Fried shrimp  - Fried oysters - Double sausage  Any of those with dirty rice (very peppery and spicy; so if you don't like spicy, get half and half or plain white rice) and corn bread. the corn bread is good enough to account for half a plate of rice.  - sweet potato pecan pie: sounds wierd, but strangely delicious!  The best part of this place? You can get half orders!! For small eaters like me, half orders mean two meals! delicious.   Food is cheap, fast and good. In a town full of poor graduate students and undergrads, what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"This place is heaven on earth for non sit-down restaurants. I'd go here everyday if it were up to me and if I had enough money. Yeah, thats my only problem with this place; I usually get so carried away with ordering food that before I know it I've burned $10-$18 on my lonesome self for a filling meal at NOTO, especially with the recent price increases. But whatever, it's worth it. For the food quality you get, the prices are reasonable.  You really can't go wrong with the menu; the worst you'll get is adequate. I've had so much stuff here so I'll just give a comprehensive review of what I liked/what wasn't incredible.  ---Stuff I thoroughly recommend:  Fried Chicken Wings: DON'T overlook these; some of the best wings I've had  Red Beans and Rice with Double Sausage: The double sausage is an absolute MUST-it will turn the dish from good to great. Don't forget hot sauce.  Shrimp Po' Boy: There's a reason these things are so popular; because they're freaking tasty. Get one and thank me later.  Oyster Po' Boy: Perfect balance of flavorful batter and oyster goodness.  Fried Catfish: Catfish heaven (in Madison, at the very least). Po' Boy of this was surprisingly not nearly as impressive.  Seafood Combo w/Sweet Potato Fries: If you're feeling luxurious, get yourself a medley of savory cod, juicy oysters and fresh shrimp. Go for sweet potato fries; the normal ones are average at best.  Shrimp Étouffée: Spicy and probably quite fattening, but a definite flavor bomb in your mouth.  Hot Sauce: Sort of a joke, but seriously put hot sauce on anything that makes remote sense. Especially the fried foods.  ---Stuff I wasn't AS impressed with:  Fried Chicken Breast Po' Boy: Just tasted like a slightly upgraded version of a generic fast-food sandwich. I got it for the relatively low price. But it was still somewhat tasty.  Catfish Po' Boy: Surprisingly I thought the Po' Boy overpowered the natural tastiness of the catfish. I might have to give this another try, though, because I do love catfish and po' boys.  BBQ Beef Po' Boy: Probably my least favorite entree on the menu... just tough cubed beef drenched in barbecue sauce on bread. Okay.  Jambalaya: Peppery and tasty to an extent, but not as flavorful as I would have hoped.  Red Rice and Beans (w/o Sausage): A bit overhyped without double sausage, although still good. Hot sauce is a must for these.  Shrimp Creole: Good and spicy but not incredible.  Mardi Gras Combo: (the above 3 in one dish) Actually the 3 together are a decent balance: if you're going to get one of them you might as well get this and get all 3.  ---Everything else I've tried that doesn't fit into either of those two categories  Deb's BBQ Shrimp: Great potential, good flavors, but seems a bit one-sided in terms of just lemon and butter. I can't really explain it; wouldn't recommend it nor discourage it.  Fried Gulf Shrimp: Above average if you're a fan of fried shrimp (and decent portion) but then again it's... fried shrimp. I'm a bigger fan of the Po' Boy.  Dirty Rice: I'm still trying to figure out what I think of this in comparison with the other dishes. It just seems like rice with salt and cayenne plus trace amounts of other spices that somehow augment the taste a little bit.  That turned out a lot longer than it should have but honestly there isn't a single thing that I've had here that I was \"disappointed\" with (or for anything that was I disappointed with, it was because I had set the bar so high from previous trips here). Take your pick and I'm sure you'll enjoy what you get."}
{"text":"Why has been so long since I visited New Orleans Take-Out? I have no reasonable excuse. Whatever, I was glad to find myself sitting at the window-facing counter on Monroe St yesterday happily soaking up the sun. I could not decide what to eat. With age, my ability to handle serious heat has waned. The server was kind enough to let me tasted the Etouffee  and the Dirty Rice. I loved the Etouffee but knew it would not like me. The Dirty Rice was plenty hot but felt manageable.   I almost never order fried food but decided to try a half order of the fried oysters with a side of Dirty Rice. The oysters were perfectly prepared. The coating was nice and crisp and the oysters were barely cooked (not at all rubbery). The flavor was sweet and mild. The breading stayed put so you could even cut each oyster into pieces allowing me to savor the experience. I was unable to finish the rice and I believe a half-order would be plenty for the average eater.  I volunteer with an agency located on Fordem Avenue and often leave my shift hungry and tired. I will reward my good works with good food. Luckily I don't have to travel far."}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall eatery for take-out or counter service. Food is inexpensive and heavy. The pralines were good, but the rest left me with regrets."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great shrimp po' boy sandwiches.  It's about the only I've ever gotten just because they are so good I find it hard to get anything else.  It's about $10 for a sandwich and fries but it's excellent quality.  People seem to forget that good food costs a little more.  Sure, I could spend $6 at Mcdonalds but that's crap, so $10 for lunch that fills you up and is real food is well worth it.  Update 12/2014:  I got the crab cakes and they were very good and the cornbread, Mmmm.  My only negative would be the size of the crab cakes for the price.  You get 3 but they are barely the size of oreo cookies."}
{"text":"Shrimp po boy was delicious. Quickly prepared and exceeded expectations. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"To say it's among the best in Madison would be an understatement. I can say that after one trip if they're at all consistent.  Friends and family have been recommending this place for longer than I can remember. Although I'm in Madison a lot, I only recently got a chance to check it out. I can definitely say I'll make a better effort to get back because this place has earned its good reputation.  I'm into spicy food, so I ordered the shrimp etoufée, advertised on the menu as \"very, very hot.\" I thought it was just right; the etoufée was hot enough to get the nose running a little bit without being overwhelming. The flavor was intense without feeling like you're being kicked in the mouth.  I can't wait to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Creole place in Madison. Their seafood gumbo and crawfish etoufee are delicious! The cornbread just melts in your mouth. The portions are smaller and it's a little expensive for carryout but the quality of the food makes up for it. Their jambalaya is decent but it is not my favorite.  I highly recommend the sweet potato fries! They serve a very traditional bread pudding that was just not to my liking. Overall though, for Cajun food, you can't go wrong with these guys."}
{"text":"Oyster po boy was great with creole sauce. Bf had étouffée w shrimp which was also very good."}
{"text":"So delicious-- the fried chicken is awesome. So is the cornbread. Dirty rice is really spicy so I go 50/50 spicy/regular but honestly, this place rocks. I wish they delivered! But seriously, worth the walk. It's intended to be take out but there's a bar to eat at."}
{"text":"Good shrimp jambalaya but great cornbread in a developing neighborhood.  A future spot on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives show."}
{"text":"It has the hottest food in Madison, the shrimp creole. New Orleans has my favorite American food and this restaurant certainly brings it closer to me. I have really enjoyed this place. The quality is rather consistent. No disappointment yet. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discuss food often and he talked about his place with reverence always.  Well OMG.. it REALLY is special.  A simple chicken poboy made right..  Dipping it into certain soups of the day (curry chicken and creole cheeseburger were my favorites).  We call them dipping sauces (lol) and have even gone so far as to plan a trip to Madison based on the soups that day.  And their etouffe labelled \"too hot to eat\" actually lives up to its name while still retaining seriously good flavor is another rare find indeed."}
{"text":"A very nice place for either take-out or dinning in. Usually not crowded at all during lunch/dinner and thus you can get your food within 5 minutes. My friends recommend the Jambalaya but I prefer Gras Combo and Shrimp Etouffee, especially the Shrimp Etouffee: very spicy but very tasty. Also, I recommend choosing the corn bread with your dishes. Moreover, you can expect to fill your stomach by only spending less than 8 dollars. Overall, great dishes, great place, great price, why not :)"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp po'boy with the garlic sauce and a side of dirty rice. The po'boy was incredible and the dirty rice was quite spicy but still very good. And trust me when I say it was spicy. I love spicy but this was a little too much for me"}
{"text":"I went back 2/13/10 with a friend. I had a shrimp po'boy. The bread was kind of hard, the sandwich kind of plain. I forgot to ask for some sauce. My friend had the chicken wings with dirty rice. It was pretty good. The cornbread was a disappointment. It was stale and nothing like what I had the first time ordering from here. Hit or miss? The \"Hinckley\" water dispenser was empty when we got there. It was quickly deduced from the dripping water on the outside of the canister that it was being refilled with tap. Still a 2-star experience for me. I tried!  ********************************* I tried the shrimp etouffee on a Sat evening. I called in the order and the girl warned me the dish would be spicy hot. I asked, \"Like booger running hot?\" She said, \"Pretty much.\" I said, \"Yeah, I'll take a small order with a side of cornbread.\"   The cornbread tasted fantastic. So much it inspired me to bake my own cornbread (so far with 3 different recipes) for the last 2 weeks.   I was disappointed with the amount in the takeout clam shell container. It barely reached a height of an inch worth of food! I counted the shrimp and ok, I got like 6 shrimp for the price of $5.75. But it looked like they just skimmed the bottom of the container with as little rice as possible with the 6 shrimp in sauce. It was spicy and yes it made my boogers run, but it was good until I realized it wouldn't feed me and my daughter and I let her have the rest of it.   There is a small dine-in area along the windows and a couple tables inside. I'm thinking I'll probably dine in one of these days to really make sure the portions aren't THAT small. I'd order again because I believe in 2nd chances."}
{"text":"I have been going to both of the NOTO places for many years now, I would have gone four stars but there are some quality problems at the eastside shop.  It is closest to our house so we would like to go there but over the years we have gotten a few inedible poorly prepared dishes from the east side establishment and when it is good it still seems lower quality vegetables and such, less fresh like the food has been in a steam table for a while.    The downtown establishment I have never had a bad dish from as a result we drive across the isthmus to get takeout which is a bit of a schlep so we order from them less often then we might otherwise."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest staff, but this place is one of the true gems in town all things-considered."}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmm good!  The catfish was our favorite, but everything was soooo good.  Get the cornbread!"}
{"text":"I just got back from a trip to NOLA and decided I needed to ween myself off the seafood binge with some of that good New Orleans Takeout. I've come here many times in the past too and tasted most things on the menu.   Get the fried catfish. I get mine with cornbread and red beans n rice. You don't see catfish much on the menu in Madison, so branch out and try. It's fried to perfection, and with some hot sauce on it  . The po-boys are stellar. For smaller entree or apps get anything in the specialties side of the menu covered in the creole or etouffee sauces if you can handle some heat, it's ok to skip the jambalaya, gumbo and dirty rice (they're good but not the stars of the show)."}
{"text":"Their seafood gumbo was great!  Granted the portions were a little small...I got the cup which contained 2 (or 3 I can't remember) shrimp and 1 oyster, but they were delicious!  Very tender, not overcooked and hard like most places that do seafood and the price was great too, I think it was something like 4.95.  I'm only detracting a star because their \"french bread\" wasn't really french bread, it was dry and crumbly and not very good.  Staff was super friendly in making the recommendation."}
{"text":"NOTO!  I was looking at the other cajun restaurants listed in Best of Madison for 2012 and this is the only one I've tried so far. But I have gone here many times and they are very consistent. Everything that I have eaten here was delicious. No let downs. Deb's bbq and whatever fish special they have are my favs; but also good are the etouffees (usually too spicy for me) and the crab cakes.   Their dirty rice (spicy) is usually a bit too much for me so I always ask for half dirty rice half white.   They are mostly a take-out place but they do have a bar area to eat in. I tend to like eating at whatever place I by my food from (I dislike take out boxes and my food cooling down) so it does well by me...I guess don't plan this as a first date type of place."}
{"text":"I love this place. I make the trip from Milwaukee to Madison just to eat here. BBQ shrimp is amazing... Well, maybe that's the only thing I've ever eaten - that's OK. I'd do it again, forever."}
{"text":"Bland New Orleans/Cajun food is an oxymoron, but at New Orleans take-out it's a reality.  Flavors here (with the exception of the sausage in the Red Beans and Rice) could be best described as vapid."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place for Cajun. When you go in there I want you to expect a special of the day, homemade lemonade, and a everything made from scratch type feel. This isn't a place where you meet a hostess and they seat you. Just expect the best beans and rice outside of New Orleans."}
{"text":"The blackened catfish with dirty rice, crawfish etouffee and corn bread are the three things I would order as a \"last meal\" if I was given the option. It doesn't get any better than this. Madison is lucky to have this Creole cajun restaurant. Just go."}
{"text":"I looooove me some NOTO. You wouldn't expect such an amazing New Orleans-style place in Madison, but here it is. Red beans and rice == love."}
{"text":"All the po boys are delicious, as are much of the sides. The red beans and rice is so-so, but the jambalaya is very tasty as well. Always stop by here for a bite if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So - I've gotten take out from here a few times - but the last time deserves a post/story/review. Like so SO many - on Fat Tuesday this year I just had to get some New Orleans Take Out. Clearly one of their busiest days of the year. This year I got there and had to park behind the building next door... got inside the door and the line to order was snaking around the small interior....phone was ringing off the hook and staff had no time to even answer it. Total chaos. Not really unexpected. What impressed me was the staff - at the register - putting together orders - cooking - all of them . . . clearly under pressure but professionally keeping it together and keeping their cool. Even handing out beads and smiles. About 5 minutes after I placed my order the group waiting was informed that the orders taken would be filled but they couldn't take more because they ran out of food. I don't remember this 'ever' happening before - but again not a big surprise. One lady who hadn't ordered yet was mad - but again the staff was cool. Very nice job in a very stressful situation. One lady stood by the door and gave beads to people who came and had to be turned away. Finally I got my food - and honestly, on the ride home I was sort of thinking that the taste or quality might have slid a bit on a crazy busy day like this. When I got home and ate - WOW - it was SO good. Despite the crazy situation and running out of food - everything was outstanding. Big props to the cooks and the staff and everyone there. Very nice place - great food - I won't hesitate to come back again. Even on Fat Tuesday again! YUM!"}
{"text":"this place is on my list at least a couple times a month, and it's probably the only restaurant in madison that can claim that.    The only thing I've got to say on the negative side is the crawfish off season are a bit mealy and I have switched to shimp.  everything else is spot on, esp the read beans and rice.  oh, and it's closed on  sunday...which is always the day you start to crave a po' boy.   What do I say you get.  for 2 ppl, we get a full order of shrimp etoufee, shimp creole and a red bean and rice double meat.  all with french bread.  it's a ton of food but oh so good."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price...  I finally got to try out the New Orleans Take Out Restaurant and was fairly impressed. The wife and I split an order of etoufee and black beans and rice. It was plenty of food. Nothing too fancy, but it was tasty. I will definitely be going back and will hopefully try out a poboy and some of their other dishes. .   For the people saying no place to sit. Are you sure you are rating the correct location? They had plenty of tables there complete with copies of the northside news paper, isthmus and the onion."}
{"text":"I'm from South Florida and we know good food so while in Wisconsin for training for work and wanted to eat really good food and this spot did not dissappoint. Although I couldn't try everything I did have the Etouffé and as long as you like spice this is hands down 1 thing you need to order. Plus the employees are very pleasant people. Wish I had found this place early in my trip."}
{"text":"Authentic, fabulous flavors. Got the combo. Bread homemade!  Will come back! Even the husband loves it!!!!"}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? I didn't even get to eat. As soon as we walked in the cashier looked at us and walked in the back and never came back out. The cooks were outside smoking and gossiping about the night before's drunk. This was at 6 pm. Prime dinner time. The tables were all dirty. The visible part of the kitchen was messy and cross contaminated. Overall, we were flagrantly ignored. We left after ten minutes of non-service. I was very sad because I had heard such good reviews and the menu looked good, but the facilities were sketchy."}
{"text":"Great service! I walked in and could tell they were getting ready to close: they filled my order in minutes and were so polite. Food was fantastic! Loved the etoufee (very spicy) and the barbecue shrimp. I will definitely make a point to come here often and recommend everyone try their fantastic food"}
{"text":"Overall felt like the food lacked flavor. The jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us. The BBQ shrimp and cornbread were both good."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars because my husband can't stop talking about his crawfish etouffee. It was really delicious, but so dang spicy. If it was up to me and the rest of our group, we would probably give the place 4 stars. I had the bbq shrimp, which I did not enjoy due to the amount of rosemary dumped in the sauce. The shrimp was cooked perfectly though. I'm told the red rice and beans was decent. The rest of our group ordered off the fried menu (oysters, clams and something else I can't remember), and they all thought their dishes were pretty good.  Finally, the sweet potato fries are some the best I've ever had. I'm not usually too impressed with sweet potato fries, but these are amazing! Get them!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten food from here once, and it was good. Decent option for New Orleans food right here in Madison. Prices are okay.  I didn't like the gumbo much - it was too earthy for my taste.  I think there's a picnic table there if you need a place to sit outside. Indoor seating is limited, but there are 5-10 spots with a bar stool."}
{"text":"So good, so spicy. You have to get the rice and beans. And step outside your comfort zone! Don't just order the chicken po'boy. The crawfish etoufee is cry-your-face-off spicy good, and all of the fish dishes are excellent. I've heard the crabcakes are dream-worthy too, so that's what I'm trying next time I stop by."}
{"text":"Got in for a Friday lunch, very packed but luck out got a seat. had the fresh cod specials of the day. We got our food fairly fast. Fish taste great. So as the corn bread and sweet potato fries. Portion is just perfect. Have to say just bit way too salty, but isn't that's what creole food all are ? One star off just because of that. Personal preference.   Nice cheerful staff, even came to clean our tables during peak lunch hours. A little tight on the parking, just a few metered parking around that area. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"A Madison institution for all the right reasons. The soups are just perfect. Creole cheeseburger is one you should try. The Po boys  are my favorite. The rice and beans are overpriced. John is the original owner and totally legit. Place looks like a Louisiana dive, but is clean. Counter service only. Fast."}
{"text":"Highish prices and smallish portions, but the food here is good.  Red beans and rice are by far the best in town, and even better with sausage and hot sauce. Fried catfish or cod are both very tasty. Gumbo or other soups are hit or miss depending on freshness. I've bought 'seafood' gumbo here that had at most two shrimp and one oyster in the past and been pretty annoyed about it. Étouffée is spicy and very well executed, but may leave you hungry after. Their cornbread is amazing.   Unless you just get red beans and rice, expect to spend $10-$15 per person for take-out. Generally, sandwich and dinner portions are enough for one moderate sitting but not leftovers. Recommended."}
{"text":"NOTOS is the best New Orleans food in Madison. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for and the portions are huge. They have daily specials if you are looking to save money.   I personally like the blackened catfish, double sausage and beans, or shrimp etouffee with extra sauce.   A warning, if they say it is spicy, it is spicy. This is NOT a midwestern food restaurant, if that's your thing there is a chilis on the west side."}
{"text":"\"EAT MO BETTAH!'   I sure did!  Walk into this small building, order your food from a super chill lay back guy and minutes later you feel like you in New Orleans. The commercial for Zatarain's was playing in my mind the whole time I was eating. But so much better then the box stuff.  Would recommend the Mardi Gras Combo (red bean&rive, jambalaya & shrimp creole) because most of the time I can't make up my mind. Now the Shrimp Étouffée is said to be very, very hot. So I got a half order to play it safe. For me I've had spicier food elsewhere. Don't get me wrong it's hot put not with 2 verys. I was kinda let down by this cause I LOVE spicy food. Hotter the better."}
{"text":"My boyfriend who hasn't lived here long was in the mood for some shrimp, and had heard about NOTO from a co-worker.  I tried to warn him that everyone talks about how great it is, but how short it falls from even being good, and how it tastes like hot sauce on white rice.  So, he went and bought some rice and shrimp slop for our dinner one night.  And, now he agrees with me."}
{"text":"I've never been to New Orleans, so I don't know if that makes me somehow less qualified to review this place.  But, I suspect a fair amount of people have never been to China, and it doesn't stop them from reviewing PF Changs.  ANYWAY, the thing about NOTO whenever I have eaten there is that I am always expecting it to be way greater than it really is because of the way people talk about it.  I am always expecting this transcendent experience, but really, all I get is a styrofoam container of some spicy slop that really has no real flavor underneath the initial tongue shock of cayenne pepper."}
{"text":"Great spicy Cajun food. The Mardi Gras combo was so good! Just the right amount of spicy. The half size is a good lunch portion too. Sweet potato fries were delish.  Not much room to sit and eat but that's why it's a to-go place :)"}
{"text":"I had the etouffee with cornbread and a shrip po' boy sandwich. Both were indredibly delicious and the etouffee was actually really hot like they said it would be. Very good, very cheap. Also if you go to the one by the airport you can sit down."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem not many people know about. The food is delicious and I have never been disappointed with what I got. I love the po' boys here and it is usually what I get. This place is great for take-out and is  refreshing to have in Wisconsin which is known for kind of bland food."}
{"text":"Nice place right across the street from Camp Randall stadium. On game day we tried a few different places this was one of many.  They offer traditional NO Creole/Cajun food at a good reasonable price. Since we ate at a few places we split some fried chicken wings and red beans/rice. The chicken was excellent nice breading that was fried just right with the right amount of seasoning and not much grease. The red beans/rice were delicious too, right amount of kick and spice.  If you're in town for the game or want a taste of down south they do a great job in bringing that New Orleans Jazz to Wisconsin. This place is a little smaller but service is pretty quick, so it shouldn't take you to long to get in and out.  \"\"Laissez Les Bon Temps Roulez\" my fellow Midwesterners!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated. We paid over 18 bucks for two sandwiches and an order of sweet potato fries. Both sandwiches were essentially bread with very little in the way of fillings, and very dry. A waste of money and disappointing. Not sure what other people have ordered that was so great- I was influenced by the reviews here to try the Po Boys. Never again."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious food.  This is my favorite place in town for fried catfish.    Most of their menu comes in half sizes which is always more than enough food for me. Their fried dinners comes with \"dirty\" or white rice and french or corn bread.  If you like spice, the dirty rice is the way to go.  Dirty rice is rice cooked with celery, green peppers and onions.  It's the right level of spicy kick for me, just enough to keep things interesting.  They also have jambalaya, etouffe, and other nawlins specialties.  I really should branch out and try more stuff, but I love the fried catfish.  Perfectly breaded and fried every time.  The breading is always crisp, but not too much of it.   The staff is friendly.  There is a counter for dine in purposes, but when the weather is nice, it's perfect to get some takeout and head over to the park."}
{"text":"Authentic Cajun/New Orleans food in Madison.  I dont know what else to really say.  I've compared many dishes here to the same dishes from restaurants in New Orleans, and to home cooked versions of the same, and NOTO does them justice.  A lot of the food comes SPICY so if you cant handle heat maybe this isnt the place for you.  Favorites include the BBQ shrimp (it's not BBQ in the non-New Orleans fashion, it's sauteed in lemon and spices), etoufee, red beans & rice with double sausage and hot sauce, chicken po boy, fried oysters, really anything fried-- the breading/batter they use is amazing.  Dishes that didnt quite stack up to the real New Orleans versions-- mainly the gumbo and Jambalaya.  Something is missing, cant put my finger on what.  Shrimp po boy is too light on the shrimp, and they're missing a good roast beef po boy-- of the best things I've ever eaten in New Orleans (from Gene's).    We're lucky to have cajun food like this so far from the gulf.  Both locations now have counters where you can sit and eat, but seating is limited, so plan on takeout."}
{"text":"Since I lived in Madison (about 8 years ago) the po' boys at NOTO have haunted me!  The pursuit of a po' boy as good as this has eluded me through 4 cities and countless \"nope, not as good\"s.  I'm such a fan I bought a tank top on my last visit!  Perfect bread, perfect seasonings - be it oyster, shrimp, crawfish or chicken.    Whenever I'm back in Madison (which is, unfortunately, rarely, I take friends to get a \"sandwich as big as yo head\" and they never leave disappointed.  As I remember it, NOTO is that kind of hole in the wall place that newcomers hesitate to try out.  My advice - do it!  As much as I love these sandwiches I hardly ever order them out anymore because I know they will never be as good as at New Orleans Take Out in Madison, WI."}
{"text":"I lived near the Monroe St. location and frequented this place regularly.  Everything is super fresh and authentic. I was always a big fan of the crawfish etoufee with a big slab of cornbread.  The spice could be a little inconsistent though, which is probably a result of having super fresh spices one time and then not the next time.  No big deal though as it was always delicious either way. I regret that I have never had a po' boy from this place, but that is something I will have to remedy ASAP. I also wish that it was easier to eat at the place. I know it is takeout, but it always sucked having to walk home smelling the beautiful aromas roll out of the box. Or, alternatively when it was 40 below/snowing/raining/etc."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this place and was psyched! I ordered the Shrimp Creole, full size, with corn bread. It was plentiful, flavorful and fabulous! They aren't kidding with their heat descriptions and this was \"Very hot\". It wasn't mouth-on-fire hot, but there was heat, to be sure! I, also, had the Sweet Potato Pecan Pie because I have a weakness for pie, pecan in particular, and I just had to have me some pie! LOVED it!!! Even though they have a busy take-out business, there is limited seating inside (maybe a max of 8 people?). I chose to dine in at this sweet little joint which has a pretty cool vibe. The counter seating stretches across the front window and has a great view of the traffic on Monroe while basking in the glow of the window sign and watching the busy take-out crowd come-and-go!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely delicious!  Tried a bunch of different things and it was fantastic!  I will be back and back often!"}
{"text":"I asked them what i could get that would be really spicy, so they recommended crawfish etoufe with dirty rice. I ordered it full size because im a large human being.  The stew was stored in a plastic clam shell, and i didnt know this so i spilled some by holding my bag vertically, so heed my warning! Learn from my mistake!  I got home and dug in. They really delivered; this was an incredibly spicy dinner!  I found this to be pretty delicious. The dirty rice was not too soft, so it went well texturally with the etoufe. There was a lot of meaty crawfish too! Theres a lot of chicken broth in the flavor, so theres a nice savory base to the spiciness.  My main bone to pick is with the cornbread it comes with. Flavor-wise, it's ok; maybe it's a little too sweet. Texturally, its pretty bad. It kind of reminded me of a dish sponge that was used a few times then left to dry. I threw the rest away after the first bite.  Overall, this was a pretty solid dinner with huge portions, but i dont know if it was worth $17 (the dirty rice upgrade cost extra). I will probably come back at some point to try their fried cod and blackened chicken. I will probably only get half orders from now on since this full order was pretty big even for me."}
{"text":"Last day of business was May 20.  Came in one last time.  An hour wait for delicious food.   Worth it.  They will be missed!"}
{"text":"I just discovered I'm allergic to shellfish.  Since anaphylactic shock scares the crap out of me many of the items on the menu are out of the question.  Still, this place makes a mean po' boy and I like to go often."}
{"text":"Now, I've never been to New Orleans to try the types of cooking they have there. So I can't vouch for how good New Orleans Take-Out compares to the restaurants it seeks to emulate. What I can say is that their food here is absolutely excellent. I've had their jambalaya and their gumbo; both were top notch. I regret not going here as often; if I had lived in the neighborhood when I lived in Madison, this place would have been a staple."}
{"text":"Not bad! I make Creole food a lot myself, and here I can get my own cooking in 1/20 the time. The shrimp and crawfish étouffée are *very* spicy, but delicious. I would recommend you get a half-serving of the étouffée along with something else to moderate the spice. The gumbo is not quite as savory and flavorful as I would prefer, but for the price this place is a great find. Finally, I particularly like their somewhat run-down feel. There's a line between somewhere derelict and somewhere with character, and this place is just on this side of \"with character\". Go for lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite place for fast food in Madison - I have both locations in my cell phone for quicker pickup.  If it's Thursday try the Shrimp in Cream Sauce or Crawfish in Cream Sauce special....any other day, the Red Beans'n'Rice with Double Sausage will never treat you wrong!"}

{"text":"Oyster Po' Boy is simple and subtle yet delicious.  Their potato salad lives up to their hype as well.  On the other hand, I've been disappointed in some of their other sandwiches (notably the shrimp po' boy).    The bread is really good in its own way but I agree sometimes there's too much of it.    Overall I'd be sad if they weren't around to give me my fried oyster fix every once in a while."}
{"text":"Oyster Po'Boy is money.  Their bread is really good and the taste is unique."}
{"text":"Want to like this place but have had the definition of \"meh\" experiences through the years.   I've been consistent with ordering jambalaya because its the quintessential New Orleans dish. You've got to have a good jambalaya in order to do anything else right, right?   New Orleans Take Out doesn't have this right! The sausage in my lunch today was fried up hot, but the precooked rice mixture was room temp to warm in different spots within the rice. I accept I'm not able to get from scratch jambalaya but my portion from the batch ought to be warmed in the skillet that was used for the sausage.   The sausage was also really thin cut, which I accept as a time saving device but five pieces isn't enough. I feel andouille is the authentic meat and this did not seem to be that. Chicken would have been fair amount if there had been more than one cube of ham.   The cornbread I've noticed people raving about in reviews I cannot agree with. I had a maybe 1 1/2 inch by 1 1/2 inch square at room temp. No butter. No bettah. (Also no corn or jalapeño or sweetness. It wasn't a full step above a Jiffy mix really. Adapt your own from the box. I'm sticking with my Lucinda Williams version).  +Two sizes for entrees -No public restroom +Authentic music, decor -Not really ADA accessible  If you're in the area AND craving NOLA grub, give this place a shot though I cannot recommend it outright. If you've got the ability and a hankering for jambalaya, Liliana's is the spot."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison.  I have never had a bad meal here, and I have eaten here more than 100 times.  I recommend the shrimp po' boy, the jambayala, red beans and rice, Mardi Gras combo, and my favorite, Deb's barbecued shrimp."}
{"text":"After moving into the University Heights neighborhood, I have been hitting up every food spot in walking distance. Luckily, the walking is offsetting the massive amount of calories I've been consuming.  As the name indicates, the space is built primarily for takeout but there are a couple seats along the wall and front window for those that wish to dine in.  Pro-tip:  Call in ahead to save you some waiting time. The menu has your typical fare-red beans and rice, jambalaya, gumbo, po' boys.  I opted for the oyster po' boy along with a cup of the gumbo special.  The oysters were friend perfectly in a light batter.  Served with mayo and pickles, it screams for a couple dashes of hot sauce to round out the flavors.  The gumbo had a depth of flavor that indicates they know what they are doing when whipping up a roux.  My only slight criticism was the andouille.  The texture was rather mushy and lacked any real smoky flavor indicating to a lower quality sausage.   I will definitely be back whenever the urge for cajun/creole hits."}
{"text":"Not bad! I thought they were great until I went to the Bayou. Now I swear by that place. New Orleans Take-Out is much cheaper. I lived in the south for a few years and this place doesn't quite manage to get the taste right. I don't know what it is. It's still pretty good though, just doesn't satisfy my cravings. I LOVE their cornbread. Sometimes I just get orders of that."}
{"text":"Been a while since I been there, but it was always a solid five stars in the past.   I didn't know there were people in Madison that didn't like NOTO..... must be something wrong with them...?... probably don't like cold beer either!"}
{"text":"On the quieter (and noticeably less trendy) end of Monroe St., New Orleans Take-Out feels out of place. From the signage to the distant staff, the ambience of the place is way off. There really isn't much redeemable about this place until you try the food. The chicken cutlet, cornbread and dirty rice (while expensive for the amount of food that I got) were good and filling. If you want a good place to sit-down and eat, seek elsewhere, but this food is pretty darn yummy."}
{"text":"There are fewer places than New Orleans Take-Out in Madison that I could care less to eat at ever again.  The food is mediocre, I've been here twice and neither things I've had were all that amazing. I had a Shrimp Po' Boy--the shrimp was undercooked and the flavoring was dull. And I've also had the Barbequed Beef Po' Boy--also very mediocre; the meat was dry and the bread was slightly stale. And maybe that's my fault--maybe the Po' Boys overall are just lacking and anything else could be good.  The service is equally as lacking; every time I've been here I've had the misfortune of having the unhappiest looking staff and how upset they get if you ask about ingredients (I have a food allergy to onions so I always have to check just in case).  Regardless, two awful experiences with this place are enough to keep me away. Maybe it's good, but I won't bother wasting my money to try and find out."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I got the Mardi Gras combo and I'm really glad I did because you get to try three things. The shrimp creole, the jambalaya, and the red beans and rice. The shrimp creole was delicious! I loved the spice and the jambalaya was flavored very well. Even the red beans were yummy!  The reason why I gave three stars is because the food is slightly overpriced and the bread pudding was really disappointing. I got it because it was a New Orleans tradition but the bread pudding was hard and not very flavorful. I love dessert so if I get something disappointing I get kinda sad. But I would definitely recommend coming here for the main dishes!"}
{"text":"I love NOTO the shrimp Po'Boy has alway been my favorite item.  But the Crab Cakes are also excellent. The pimento cream sause is to die for. i cant say enough about this place. Have always been very satisfied!!! my whole family loves it."}
{"text":"Great food everytime we dine here! Half portion sizes are perfect.  If the menu says spicy, it's not lying! Favorites are beans with sausage, catfish, and jumbalaya."}
{"text":"The best food I've had in a loooooong time! TRY THE GARLIC SAUCE!!!!!! I've ate here everyday for a week once! Fried oysters dirty rice with creole sauce potato salad and extra garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"YUUUUUM!!!  I have been eating here (well, the one on Fordem) since high school. All I gotta say is that you need to try the catfish po boy at some point, with the garlic sauce.    Also, the cod is good.    YUUUUUMM!!"}
{"text":"We needed a lunch fix while taking in some nearby sights on our vacation and this place popped up on Yelp's radar. Once again, Yelpers recommended a good one. The crab cakes were the best we've had. The shrimp po' boy was also very good. The ambiance, meh, that's why \"Take-Out\" is in the restaurant name. But for friendly service and tasty food, this is a great option."}
{"text":"I am floored at the fact that there are a few people who said the food was \"flavorless.\" They are ridiculous. I love the east side location. I get the crawfish etoufee with corn bread and extra rice because it's so spicy!!! But the flavor is unmatched. The spice is sinus clearing, and the amazing flavor is so worth it! I have had nothing but great experiences with NOTO, and I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Crawfish Etouffee. Hmm, it was a good lunch.  \"Very, very hot\"? Well, it's one of the hotter things I've been served in Madison. To try to put it objectively, it burns a bit less than eating a whole, raw jalapeno.  Once your mouth adjusts to the heat, you can make out the other flavors in the sauce, and it's actually very light on flavor.  I've never had crayfish before. It was good, with a generous amount. It was sweet like a shrimpy taste, but soft in texture like a lobster. I would just get shrimp next time and not pay the extra.  Vegetarian items and specials are very cheap!  Service was fast! They were pretty busy, told me it would be 10 minutes and it was ready in 5."}
{"text":"The Madison skies were gray today and a rare summer chill was in the air. I needed something to spice up my afternoon and New Orleans Take-Out  did the trick! I was able to score \"rock star\" parking across the street and made a bee-line to the cozy yellow sign and screen door (watch out--it slams if you're not careful).  For my first NOTO experience, I had the Gulf Shrimp Dinner half portion with dirty rice and cornbread on the side. Ooooweeee! That is some SPICY and delicious rice! If that's dirty, I don't want to be clean. The shrimp (about ten of 'em in a small order) were freshly dredged in their own homemade batter and fried perfectly. And the cornbread? Like a little pillow of honey and corn and butter in heaven.  I don't know why I didn't order a Po Boy sandwich. After reading the menu while eating (which is weird, I know, like watching \"Food Network\" while you're eating the dinner you just slaved over), I was already planning my return visit. The staff was really friendly and the music was dope. Gray skies? I can see clearly now, the rain is gone!"}
{"text":"This would be five stars based on food alone--especially the wonderful crawfish étouffée-- but the price to portion size ratio is just ridiculous. It's simply far too expensive for takeout."}
{"text":"Decent Cajun food in Madison but portions are a little small."}
{"text":"All very good food, but the price of their red bean & rice is astronomical! Like movie theater popcorn prices!"}
{"text":"love the too hot to eat shrimp etouffe favorite spicy dish in madison all the kinds of po boys ive tried have been very good could have better beverage selection i like the cornbread"}
{"text":"Good food, slightly high prices.  I had the crawfish etouffee, my standard cajun dish.  It was quite good.  My brother had red beans and rice with sausage, which he loved.  Our friend had red beans and rice.  All were good.  No leftovers, but we were full.  The fresh lemonade was good; the maple bacon pralin was meh."}
{"text":"was in town last weekend on business and drove by and the thought of some nola food caught my fancy.  i ordered the combo etoufee and jambalaya that came with red beans and rice. honestly it was okay - the etoufee was good but the jambalaya was tasteless as well as the red beans and rice needed a little more kick.  i also tried the dirty rice and it was awful! it must have been cooked in a cayenne pepper jacuzzi b/c that all i tasted and drank three glasses of water!    the staff was really nice though so even though i didn't like most of the food i would come back again and this time try one of their po boy sandwich."}
{"text":"I just tried this place today (Fat Tuesday!) for lunch with my friend. I had Mardi Gras Combo which came with Jambalaya, red beans, rice, and shrimp dish (I forgot the name). Nice amount of spice, and I was satisfied with the \"half portion which was only $4.95. I don't think the portion would be enough for a guy though.  Keep in mind that this is a \"take-out\" place, so there's no chairs or tables, but I didn't mind standing at the counter for a quick lunch )"}
{"text":"Great food, but small portions for the high prices.  This place is definitely nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"The portions are much smaller than I expected, but that's not to say that the food wasn't extremely filling. It was. I ordered a half-size jambalaya and a side of the potato salad (because the menu said I had to try it...), and had a lot of leftovers.  I loved the jambalaya! Great flavor and perfect ratio of rice to ham to chicken to tomato. It has just enough kick to make it interesting. (; The potato salad isn't anything special, but it tasted wholesome and homemade.   The service is friendly and super speedy, but if you are really looking to get in and out, I'd suggest you call in your order in advance. That's probably what I'll do next time! See ya soon, NOTO!  Tip: Cash only, so leave your plastic at home!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! It's an authentic hole in the wall kind if place with the best Cajun food in Wisconsin. I have been to New Orleans and eating here takes me right back! The food is fresh and delicious! My favorite way to treat myself. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'm a total foodie and Chicago is great for me except we don't have NOTO. The best of the best for Creole/Cajun. Lived down south, been to N'awlins many times when I was a kid in the 70's. NOTO is the best hands down. Wish some adventuresome entrepreneur would migrate NOTO down to Chicago. It would be a huge success I am sure. We don't have anything that is even close to as good so we have to make our own or take a trip up to Madison! :)"}

{"text":"1/2 Order of Shrimp Étouffée and a Lemonade...yum!   I was hesitant to try Cajun food in Wisconsin and I'm so glad I was wrong. The Étouffée was extremely spicy which is how I like it. The service was great as well. I wish they had a bigger location!   I definitely plan on returning to try other selections."}
{"text":"Closed closed. So sad. I loved this place. Tried to go for one last meal tonight but it is closed. No cooks was the reason posted on the sign."}
{"text":"An ok restaurant. The food tastes pretty good. But not spectacular. (The sweet potato pecan pie is good; unique) Overpriced!!! Cashier was not friendly at all."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try New Orleans Take Out, sadly it was a \"Meh\" experience. We ordered red beans and rice with sausage, jumbalaya and crab cakes, and a bag of chips. Each order came with either cornbread or french bread.   The best was the red beans and rice with sausage. Thats the only thing I'd order again and it really was good. There wasnt much sausage at all for what you paid for.  The crab cakes were ok. About the size of a silver dollar and served over rice. The sauce that went with them was bland.  THe worst item was the jumbalaya. It was dry, the chicken was tough and there was absolutely no taste. The french bread looks so boring I didnt even bother to taste it. My sister said it was like something from the grocery store which surprised me b/c I had read some review about how the french bread was great. Very disappointing.  They also forgot our chips.  I actually ended up calling them to let them know that the food, minus the red beans and rice, was subpar. The woman who I spoke with said to mention it next time and they'd give me something free. It was a nice offer, but I dont think I will return...Im better off buying the ingredients and making it at home! So disappointing..."}
{"text":"This restaurant celebrating it's 29th year in Madison is nothing short of legendary. My personal favorites are the Red Beans & Rice or the Jambalaya, with either the cornbread or the French bread. This reviewer would encourage seafood lovers to try this place (if you haven't yet). Visit the Fordem Avenue location and check out all the music legends who like this place."}
{"text":"New Orleans Take-Out, how have I not reviewed you before???  The food here is just awesome; I really love pretty much everything I've tried. I've visited on a number of occasions since moving back to Madison and NOTO was just about a weekly stop when I was a grad student ten years ago. I've only visited this location on Monroe and if there's anything that's less than stellar about NOTO is that the space is exceedingly small. As the name implies they're really set up best for take out, but there is some limited bar/stool area where you can eat in house. I stopped in yesterday for just such a lunch and I'll comment on what I had:  1/2 order red beans and rice w/ double sausage: Man, oh man, is this stuff delicious! This is not a terribly complex dish, but the flavors are rich and deep. Okay, the rice is very straightforward, basically just white rice, but it acts as the perfect foil for the beans. The red beans themselves are cooked until very tender and are served in a thick, luscious sauce. to my mind the addition of sausage is an absolute necessity. Not only does the sausage add a ton of flavor, but it adds a great textural counterpoint to what is otherwise a somewhat uniformly smooth dish. Add some hot sauce? OF COURSE!!! This comes with either cornbread or french bread, both of which are tasty, but I've got to go cornbread with the red beans and rice! Absolutely love this stuff, I get it EVERY TIME!  1/2 order shrimp etouffee: It says spicy right in the description, and it is that, but there's SO MUCH MORE going on here. A known key to this kind of cooking is working from a good roux, and clearly these guys have mastered the roux! There's a silky mouth feel to this dish that makes it exceptionally pleasant to eat. On top of that this shrimp is cooked perfectly, which is surprisingly uncommon even in good restaurants. Not only do the shrimp taste like shrimp they have a great texture. The overall flavor of the dish is excellent and the spice is excellent (and nowhere near overpowering). This is served with white rice as well, which is fine, but doesn't add a ton here. For the ettouffee I think the french bread is the side of choice. the crusty bread is perfect for soaking up that ettouffee sauce! A multitude of flavors here all of which combine to make a dish that's more than the sum of it's parts. This is more than just cooking, it's cuisine!   Side of fries: They're fine. Basic, but good. Should have gone with the sweet potato fries which are much more interesting (and frankly better).   As mentioned before, the biggest knock on NOTO for me is the challenge of enjoying a nice sit down meal in the restaurant, but I don't feel like it's fair to take much off for that considering Take-Out is right in the name...   If you're a fan of cajon/creole cuisine NOTO is a great option in Madison. I'd recommend giving it a shot!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for food in the city. Have been to New Orleans and this is as good as anything I had don there. I am a big fan of the Jumbalaya with sausage. The rice and beans, Po boys are great. The naysayers don't know the cuisine. Get your beads and go."}
{"text":"The Jambalaya is better than I've had in New Orleans. New Orleans Take out is one of the best values in the city. Can't say enough about it."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places in Madison;  I like it so much that I had them cater my wedding.  I have been eating at NOTO for at least 20 years, and the food is consistently good.  I always have a hard time deciding what to get... the shrimp etouffee?  A shrimp po' boy with Creole sauce?  Or one of the daily specials like the pecan fish or the Cajun meatballs?  The cornbread is also worth noting for its yumminess."}
{"text":"How did I not find out about this place sooner! I feel like I have been robbed of the whole year I was here not knowing this place existed. The food is amazing. Since finding out about this place I eat here almost once a week. Prices are great for the portion sizes. (Cheap and large portions). Will continue to eat here often as long as they or I are around."}
{"text":"While in Madison for a ski trip, I tapped into the almighty resource that is Yelp to find some unique eats. I didn't want to eat any of the other chain garbage that all the other tourists were eating near the hotel. Enter NOTO. What an awesome little find!  After reading some of the reviews, I wanted to try a little bit of everything. The woman at the counter suggested we try the Mardi Gras Combo and the popular Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice. Yes, please!  First, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more.  On to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.  The name \"take-out\" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.  I'll definitely be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good ol' N'Orleans style cookin'."}
{"text":"The absolute best potato salad! Is it the dill seasoning? Not sure, but whatever is used sets it apart from the rest by far.  Slice of pecan pie...delish (true southern style).  Any of the po'boy sandwiches are good, but my fave is the jambalaya. Has been in business for years and whenever I am in the area I try to stop in."}
{"text":"I'm not much into seafood, but luckily NOTO has jambalaya without any shrimp! Their jambalaya is simply the best I've ever had, including some I have tried in New Orleans. The food is pretty authentic from what I have seen, and they serve it up quickly after you place your order (at both locations). This may have changed, but they still didn't take credit cards the last time I was here. Bring some cash!  Other favorites are the dirty rice and the barbecue beef po'boy. Yum! Nothing better than some NOTO eaten at James Madison Park or Observatory Drive on a beautiful summer day!"}
{"text":"Great jambalaya and po'boys!  Quick service, affordable prices, and a fairly diverse menu, and you have a recipe for the best Cajun/Creole you'll find outside of \"Nawlins.\" I always order their jambalaya, which is a chicken-ham-sausage variant minus the shrimp (not a fan of crustaceans). It has plenty of kick without being too spicy and is very savory. I also love the barbecue beef po' boy. This is a great portion but not so filling that it will knock you out after lunch. The red beans and rice and dirty rice are also the best you'll find around. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that they don't take credit cards. I always have to plan a stop here in advance."}
{"text":"The service and hospitality was second to none.  I had a great experience stopping here for a quick bite and would definitely come back.  Ask for the food a little less spicy if you have a typical Midwestern palate.  However it was bearable for me.  As \"authentic\" of experience as you could ever hope for in Madison, WI."}
{"text":"Have to agree with the others that say the red beans and rice with sausage is awesome.  It is.  No place to sit though.  Good for takeout."}
{"text":"Do you ever get the craving to light yourself on fire?! I do! And I like to hose myself down with a diet coke as I then slip into a warm and buttery corn bread! Actually, make that two! Mm!   New Orleans Take-Out for me is like a Bayou treat-yo-self-day... but on a budget! This joint isn't fancy, but neither was mama's an' them's! New Orleans Take-Out is proof that fussy doesn't always mean flavor. Here, you get a selection that, while brief, can make your ears sweat with heat, or be mild enough for anyone.   It's located right near the stadium and there is only street parking, so walking might be preferred. Also, the bathrooms are about as nice as a rag on the floor that may or may not have been used (not necessarily bad, but always questionable). I still love the place!   I'm might go here tonight!"}
{"text":"Lacking in seating (as in there's none really), this take out place has some tasty creole.  Try the reds beans & rice with a double order of sausage.    More things should come with a double order of sausage."}
{"text":"Great food, especially great cornbread.  Red beans and rice are always delicious.  Some things on the menu seem overpriced while others are very reasonably priced so it just depends on what you order."}
{"text":"Hubby had the fish with pecans, and LOVED it. I, on the other hand had an absolutely pitiful shrimp Po Boy.  Big ole piece of bread, 8 shrimp set on the bread to try to cover space (it doesn't), smidge of lettuce (not necessarily a bad thing), and mushy disgusting tomatoes.  Take a bite, and all you taste is bread.  Never again."}
