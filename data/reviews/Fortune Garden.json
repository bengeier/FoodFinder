{"text":"I went to Fortune Garden for pick up with some friends being in town. The food was very fresh and flavorful. The customer service was great and the guy on the phone was very patient with me, even though I could tell in the background the place was busy. Portions are good and plenty of free items the more you spend!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Charlotte!!! spring rolls are the best , they have shrimp in them. beef and broccoli my go too! sesame chicken general to amazing. it's the closet to NYC!!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall Chinese food take out place, but don't let that fool you! Their food is awesome! Great sized portions always served piping hot, and made in a flash! One lunch or dinner serving will easily serve two adults. I am completely obsessed with their crab Rangoon! One of the few places that puts legitimate crab in the filling! They are decent size too! Having visited New York and tried their Chinese, I can honestly say this place is as close to NY Chinese food as it gets! Place is also quite clean! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Visited this place a few days ago after reading about here on Yelp.....  The location was easy to find since it is close to our supermarket (Compare) and only about a 10-15 minute drive for us.

This is the first chinese restaurant in Charlotte, NC that I've come across that really resembles the chinese food I am used to eating in NY City.  I mean, it doesn't resemble it, it is the same.  I am so glad I found this place an it is close by.  

Two things are different between this place and the ones in the Bronx....... 1. Prices are definitely higher here than in NY.  I bought an order of Boneless Spare Ribs with Pork Fried Rice and another order of General Tso's Chicken with Pork Fried Rice and I paid $23.00 total.  They threw in 2 egg rolls with that.  In NY this is more around $14-$15 TOPS!!  2.  This place is CLEAN!!  I've seen some nasty chinese restaurants in the Bronx and this place gets 5 stars in cleanliness in my book.

This place is takeout only and I don't think they deliver.  The lady at the register was friendly and got my order right.

Overall, if it wasn't for what I consider a VERY HIGH price, I would give this place 5 stars!!  It beats Chef Kwo in Ballantyne and Taipei on Johnston IMO.  This is as close to NY city chinese as I've found since moving to Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town hands down! I've been going here for 8 years. the location is not great since the Walmart closed down, but it brought in a lot of business and loyal customers including myself. Defiantly worth a go, the chicken wings are to die for."}
{"text":"Food is terrible I order beef with broccoli dinner combo and I was supper disappointed I asked ex spicy and they gave my jalape√±os I called and they told me that if I wanted them I had to ask and I never even wanted them in the first place! The food had no taste the shrimp fry rice is tasteless no flavor at all and they only give you 4 pieces of shrimp and it was so dry and the only thing that was actually ok was the egg roll.  For sure never going to come again"}
{"text":"Wow!...just grabbed a pickup order and am still in shock. I've been going to Fortune garden for takeout  every weekend for 3 years now. It's me and my wife's fave cheap Chinese joint. I decided to use my $7 off coupon today and when I handed it to the employee on the register (heavy set white woman) she said in a very upset and angry tone \"Your supposed to give this to me before I ring your total up!\". I responded, \"I'm sorry, I wasn't watching you...didn't realize you rang it up\". She went on to huff and puff like a dragon, ignore me and wait on a customer that came in after me. She finally rang me up with a horrible attitude...never saying thank you. Thanks Miss Dragon but I'll be checking out some other cheap Chinese joints...3 year tradition....over!!!"}
{"text":"It was good until the kids starting taking orders and screwing everything up, and the owner is a nasty nasty bitter women they will never get a penny from me ever again they screwed up my order and blamed it on me!"}
{"text":"The negative reviews simply do not jibe with what I know about this place.  The service is NOT horrible.  They do NOT violate child labor laws (occasionally the owner's children have manned the counter before, they are courteous, whip-smart and accurate to a fault).  Lastly, the portions are NOT tiny.  Anyone thinking their portions are tiny, well I imagine they have one heck of an appetite. 

This is a takeout only place that I have frequented since they opened in the early 90s.  It has been run by the same people since day one.  The one or 2 times there was any mix up with my order they happily corrected it.  Speak up politely, politeness works both ways you know.

The area has declined since the days when there was a Wal-Mart right there and the strip mall the Fortune Garden was in was pretty much fully occupied.  So, it is a little sketchy looking area at night.  Otherwise it is clean, and they are very quick.

The food and portions are very good.   I am a big guy and I love to eat.  That said, I can always get 2 meals out of one of their dinner combos, which generally run $7.99. And, if you've ordered several items for multiple people they throw in some freebies (extra fried rice, soda, etc).

So don't be deterred by the couple of negative reviews.  If you like Chinese food, and want to take out, and are in the area give it a try.  My family has been eating from there for over 20 years."}
{"text":"This is the best chinese food that I have found in Charlotte so far. It meets the standard of the Chinese food up North.  Of course many places in New York still have them beat but they hold their own here.  Their food is fresh, hot and tastes like good quality Chinese take out."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for pretty consistent Chinese food. We've been getting take-out here for about 10 years now, and, well, there's a reason we keep going back. Our usual is General Tso's Chicken, Egg Foo Young, Lo Mein or Chow Mein, Won Ton Soup, Spring Rolls or Egg Rolls, and an occasional added order of Sa Cha Shrimp or Beef. This last time, after all this time, I opted to choose something other than what we've been getting for a decade. I had to look up online first what some of the dishes and sauces were. I haven't tried the Moo Goo Gai Pan (not a mushroom fan), but the Moo Shu?! Wow. Definitely on the new go-to list. Always quick, pleasant, coupons and freebies galore, too! (Lots - sometimes way too much - white rice though. But, we use it for pudding/stuffed peppers/casseroles so it's not wasted.)"}
{"text":"I had been looking for good take out Chinese food for a long time. So, this is the best I've found in Charlotte (which I know isn't saying a whole lot). But, stand alone, I've always been very pleased with everything I've eaten here.
It's a typical Chinese food menu and I can vouch that the Chicken Lo Mein and Sesame Chicken are good. The egg rolls are also really good.
I'll have plenty of opportunities to expand to other things on the menu since this is only a few minutes from my house and I crave Chinese food a minimum once a week (mainly when I'm too tired to cook)."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Just take out but clean, fast and huge portions.  The service was great and their tofu is top notch."}
{"text":"This place is in a sketchy area, in a mostly abandoned strip of run down, low end shops.  There was a Walmart in the parking lot years ago, but when it left, this little pocket of town fell on hard times.  

People at my work order from this place and they've lived to tell the tale, so I thought I'd finally give it a try.  The sanitation score was 94, which made me feel better.  The waiting area was kinda run down but pretty clean and the cooks were cleaning the walls and stove area while I waited which also made me feel confident.  I ordered Chicken and Black Bean sauce and I paid an additional $1.59 to add broccoli to it.  I also ordered wonton soup.  The total was $9.59, which I thought was steep for a carry-out lunch, but I went ahead and paid it... hoping for the best.

I got the tiniest containers of food!  My soup was the biggest container in the bag!  I ate the wonton soup until I ran out of crispy noodles to float in it; it wasn't great, but it was hot and it was why I wanted Chinese to begin with so I ate it despite it's mediocre flavor.  My chicken and broccoli was just that- chicken and broccoli.  There was no trace, no nuance of black bean sauce, so I was completely lied to on that, which really irritated me!  If I'd wanted chicken and broccoli, I'd have ordered chicken and broccoli and saved my $1.59 that I paid to add broccoli to chicken and black bean sauce!  The chicken was suspect to me, so I only ate 1 piece of it and threw the rest away.  I ate the broccoli and it was tasty enough, but would have been better mixed with actual black bean sauce!  So for nearly $10.00, I got broccoli in usual brown sauce, white rice, and a little bit of borderline average wonton soup.  

I do not consider that a bargain and I will not be returning.  I hope the $1.59 you insisted on charging me for that \"additional\" broccoli was worth running off a fat girl with disposable income that eats out twice a day."}
{"text":"Good food, SERVICE IS HORRRRIIBBBBLLEE! They have gotten my order wrong 4 times already and don't even offer to redo it or discount it, simply upsetting when I use to eat there a lot! Will not anymore though"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and there food is so good. They are so sweet and have never got out order wrong. My daughter will only eat here chicken lo mein."}
{"text":"These place is OK with me. 
No frills... just QUICK Chinese food.
Great Ice Tea (oddly enough)"}
{"text":"it was fine until they started letting a child take orders and ring up food.  I have three recommendations.  1. Learn the child labor laws in this country.  2.  Teach him respect.  3. Teach him to count"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food that we have discovered in the two years that we've been in the area. The food was hot, everything tasted phenomenal, and the staff were very friendly. We've had a very hard time finding good Chinese food in the area and this tops off everything we've tried from uptown Charlotte all the way to the York County Area."}
{"text":"Great food ! Large amounts at a good price! The dinner combinations are great and hearty and the fried rice is the best for Miles."}
