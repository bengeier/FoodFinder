{"text":"Though I love the vibe, new restaurants, even the concept, and is Very tasty, but I believe it is way too pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"Tried for first time and definitely plan to return.  We came hungry and felt stuffed on their power salad and the bbq stacks.  Service was very nice and very personable for a fast casual restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoy grubstax but the place is hit or miss. I was on board until one late night during the week I took my friend to go try it. The dish was hot to touch but once you dug into the food, parts of it were cold. I chalked it up to being close to closing time on a dead weekday it's what you get. So I took a break and tried again in which they resurrected themselves. All the times I went were for dine in. The last experience I was in the district and decided to grab my son takeout. When I got it home I looked and wondered for $12 where all the food was?!  I felt like it was literally half the serving of when you dine in. It was slopped in a box with no presentation effort. It's take out I get it!  But royally disappointed!  Should of took a picture but he was hungry and dove right in. Waffle fries go soggy fast.  Tip...tell them your dining in and ask for a box when they bring it. Takes few extra minutes but you'll be sure your getting the right portion for your money's worth."}
{"text":"A fresh take on food altogether!  This place makes me want to eat my veggies and go back for seconds.  What a great new concept with a cool atmosphere to boot.  The Original Grubstak is delicious but you won't regret any other options or creating your own.  All good things.  Owner Colton Grubb has struck GOLD!"}
{"text":"Our best New Favorite in DownTown Gilbert. Food is phenomenal and service is just as good! We had lunch - shared the B.Fast stak along with a BBQ stak. Fresh, high quality, ingredients. Very comfortable environment, and so very clean.   Owner is almost always on-site, rest of staff quite friendly and efficient as well. Good Folks.  We'll be back, weekly at the least!!"}
{"text":"Got the grubatouille and it was so yummy and fresh. Also very fast and nice atmosphere. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Second time here everything we get is always  delicious. Fair prices and there is something for everyone's taste. Very clean. Friendly staff. This place is a hidden gem in downtown Gilbert. Even Mr Bidwill was here Go Cardinals!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  My boyfriend got the Nacho with the waffle fries, I got the Power Salad. Both so good. Also, great local beers and a nice location. Definitely recommend for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Grubstack today for the first time and really liked it. It is new, modern and clean and the food is very different and very good. I had the power salad which had a really good pesto sauce and my husband had the ultimate Salad which he loved. The portions are large and served in a pan.  We also got the dessert sweet potato waffle fries which were really good and a large portion that we shared. The service was quick and the staff friendly.   The music wasn't too loud and the temperature was comfortable for this hot day.   We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best customer service in a long time! So so so nice. Oh and the food is awesome. Gluten free and vegan specified on the menu. Definitely coming back. Cool vibe."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, great (!) service, and good prices.  My wife tried the grubatouille stak, and I had the gold rush stak. Enjoyed them both.  One minor nitpick was that the gold rush, which I got on top of a bed that was half veggies and half waffle fries, was a little dry at the end. Probably needed a tiny bit more sauce. The staff were uniformly friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. Excellent in every respect. Looking forward to coming back and trying the salads -- and maybe even the brunch. Maybe tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I made the trip from Litchfield Park to visit Grubstak with some friends as I had heard some great buzz about this new spot. We were all warmly and professionally greeted. One of the owners even recognized our friends from a week or so prior. We were given a very good explanation of the menu and a few recommendations. I myself didn't want to get away from the Mac attack sandwich and it was recommended I add chicken. What a great recommendation, it was delicious! They had a few good local beers on tap which for me is a great addition. Everyone in our party enjoyed their meals and couldn't be happier with the continuously attentive and professional service who checked in on us multiple times and offered to clear our dishes. Overall we couldn't be happier with the value for the food and service provided. Do yourself a favor and stop in here!"}
{"text":"Good selection of coffee unusual and tasty dishes. Our family had two different staks, a grill cheese and a kids mac & cheese. All were pleased, but one did wish the grill cheese had the tomatoes in it versus on top of the bread."}
{"text":"When in Gilbert, make a point of eating at Grubstak...and take a friend or two with you...you will be glad you did. Your dining experience will be an eclectic combination of what most would consider to be classic comfort foods. Expertly prepared under the culinary leadership of chef Seth Widdes and presented in \"staks\"....the experience is best enjoyed with a little preparation and study of the menu, before you go. I found most of the previous Yelp posts about Grubstak to be pretty accurate in describing the variety and quality of meals, so be sure to read those reviews, along with the menu.    Grubstak is a short walk from the City of Gilbert parking ramp, which offers plenty of parking space and makes your day or evening out even more enjoyable...no parking hassle at all in what is typically a pretty busy location.  Just go!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Every time we go great service, people are friendly, the food is awesome I have yet to be disappointed in what I've ordered.  The meat is cooked perfectly and the combinations are insane and not greasy spoon type food.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hip, modern place with very friendly staff and fantastic food.  I had the Sweet Lou's BBQ and Kelly had the Notorius R.I.B. and both were great.  I had a cold SunBru and Kelly had a glass of red- all for $30.  If we didn't live an hour away we'd be here all the time, but even with the distance this will be a regular stop.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We ordered the grubstak and the mac attack. I'd definitely order both again. The service was great, food was served quick and the restaurant was very clean! We're excited for the new addition to our town!"}
{"text":"Can't lie, best and most thoughtfull place my family has been for our birthday celebrations. We will be back...no doubt about it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love this place. We go here frequently and it never disappoints. The food is amazing and there are so many good options to choose from. It is the perfect place to go when you don't want to deal with the long wait that most restaurants in Downtown Gilbert have but want a great meal. We are big fans and will continue to be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Great food. Quick service. Menu is varied so everyone can find something that suits their tastes.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was great. We were shocked at how few people were there. Try something with the waffle or sweet potato fries, we weren't too impressed with the root vegetable base."}
{"text":"Great-tasting waffle fries with many different options. I shared the ranchero with my girlfriend and was surprised by the large portion of chicken it came with. During happy hour they have $2 sliders between two waffle fries! Healthier combos available like half sweet potato fries half-salad. Cool, inventive place with reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review as I feel obliged to share my dining experience at GrubStak. I was shocked to see a 4 star average rating. My wife and I have visited nearly all the restaurants in downtown Gilbert and were excited to give this a try! Perhaps another superbly executed culinary concept for the East Valley? Disappointingly not. Both the style of the restaurant and concept of the platters are hip and unique. Unfortunately the quality of the food doesn't hold up (it looks great for a moment!). I had the brisket over fries...the meat was 1/2 fat and hardly edible. The BBQ sauce on top might as well have come from a fast food packet. Cole slaw topper? More like cold slop. My wife got the golden chicken...it was breaded so thick it was hard to find the chicken. The sauce was so sticky...imagine Chinese buffet sitting under a heat lamp for eight hours. Do not be fooled by the good looks. Save yourself the time and walk a few steps to one of the many other wonderful choices downtown offers."}
{"text":"Amazing new restaurant in downtown Gilbert!! Tucked away from the main drag of Gilbert road with incredible food!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed at this place. The food is over priced and it doesn't even taste all that. I ordered Chicken Parmesan and my friend ordered Grubstak.   The chicken was so dry and hard to chew. A small kid can choke on this kind of chicken. The chicken is not fresh, more like frozen and got fried. The mozzarella cheese was not melting and it was mostly potatoes. The tomato sauce taste like the bottle one I can buy at the store, nothing special.   The Grubstak was ok at the beginning but it gets cold too fast that it doesn't taste good.   This place is brand new, they should put more quality when cooking. They got plenty of time and I felt like they are rushing it like it was a fast food restaurant. There are a lot of competitors close by. Now I know why this place never gets busy and people always pass it by. Overall, I will never coming back at this place."}
{"text":"The is definitely a good place to checkout. The casual atmosphere and simple main dishes are great for families and #datenights. I highly recommend the Mac Attack."}
{"text":"Genius idea! I am a French fry lover and this place is perfect. My husband and I got the Sweet Lou BBQ stak and the Chillax stak and shared them. They were both so yummy. If you aren't in the mood for French fries (I'm not sure how this statement could ever possibly be true; but) you can substitute them for roasted root veggies. I can't wait for an excuse to go back to Gilbert so I can try more staks. HOPEFULLY they will open one of these in Phoenix VERY SOON!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Rancher and it was really good. I love the idea of French fries piled with stuff, it's basically French fruit nachos. I will definitely be return to try some of the other ones."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff.  Fries with stuff on top.  Chicken, beef, pork, Mac and cheese.  Covered in cheese and sauce.  So far my favorite is the Goldrush.  Fries, sweet buffalo chicken, blue cheese, and celery/carrot slaw all drizzled with buffalo sauce.  Finish it off with s'mores for dessert."}
{"text":"Between the service and the food this place is a must! We had been seeing a bunch of pictures of this place on instagram and had to finally visit. We ordered the gold rush and the chillax, both nothing short of delicious! The portions are huge and enough for two. Go visit you won't regret it. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and staff. I think the portion sizes are a bit small and what they serve the meal in   Is super hot! We had a great conversation with the shift manager and a staff member. Both were very friendly. I ordered the barbecue stak and found it to be a bit bland. Not sure that I would come back."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews on Yelp.  Had to try this place out.  Parked in the parking garage.   Restaurant  was right there.  Very easy to find. Went there for my birthday.   My mom, sister,  my daughter, and niece went there.  We each ordered different stuff and loved it.  I partook  in 5he $2.00 Coronas.  With  my macaroni  stuffed grilled cheese sandwich and 50/50fries, I was good.  Will definetly come back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant!  The food is so unique and absolutely delicious.  I ordered the Gold Rush over roasted vegetables and it was fantastic.  The vegetables tasted sooo good....best ever! It's awesome to be able to find something so healthy that taste so good."}
{"text":"Such a fun little spot with really good food, nestled in the newly renovated Downtown Gilbert. I ordered a Power Salad (kale, quinoa, chicken etc) and the hubby had the Rancher stak.  It must've been good because he could only enthusiastically nod and smile his approval in between all the tasty bites. Did I mention kids eat free on Tuesdays? Yeah that's what brought us here for the first time, but it won't be for the last time. Don't miss out on the ah-MAY-zing Give Me S'more dessert. Ooey gooey chocolate sauce and melted marshmallow over warm cake. Yeah it's that good. We'll be back Grubstak!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place. Ordered the Grubatouille for myself (with chicken) and my husband got the Chillax. He enjoyed his. For the Grubatouille, they decided to substitute broccoli instead of the advertised root vegetable base. When asking the food runner about it, she replied that broccoli was a root vegetable, then walked away. I understand if they run out of ingredients, but it's something that should be mentioned at the time of order, rather than when your food is being delivered with a base of broccoli (which isn't a root vegetable), instead of what you thought you'd ordered.  The manager did come out to apologize and brought desserts. The good service is appreciated.  *edit* To clarify, I did know that broccoli was included in the medley, the cashier was very helpful in explaining that. The issue was that there were no root veggies in the medley. I was given only broccoli and an explanation after the fact that they'd run out of prepared roots because they were busier than expected. So I got a pile of broccoli, some squash, eggplant, and the chicken I'd added. I know how it goes when huge rushes come in, but a warning that there weren't actually any roots prepared when I was placing my order would've been helpful."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a staff member while looking at the menu posted outside. We came back the next day and tried it out.  Simply delicious, great food on top of amazing waffle fries. This place is a welcome, inexpensive alternative to the surrounding options. The service is also excellent!"}
{"text":"Everybody was really friendly and the food was really good.  Grubstak had: -really good food -unique combinations I have not tried before -really cool atmosphere, decor -very friendly employees  I will continue to come by and try more dishes, though!  One thing lacking, though, was dessert. I'm sure if they ever start making desserts, they will be really good.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I came here with 7 other people on a girls night out.  We each ordered something different so that we could taste them all.  There was not a single item that we ordered, that we didn't like.  I personally ordered the \"Nacho\" but I had a hard time sharing it! That barbacoa beef had me thinking about it for days! Great place with fast and fabulous service."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Something for everyone!! Check out the Brunch menu. We love coming here great value, good food wonderful atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at a reasonable price!  My wife had the Sweet Lou's and I tried the Gold Rush and both of us enjoyed our choices immensely.  This is a new concept that should have a nice future in Gilbert.  The ambiance is (as you would expect in a new business) cool, clean and welcoming...supported by a very attentive, pleasant staff.  The portions are more than adequate and the fusion of flavors in both of our dishes was top drawer.  We would highly recommend Grubstak to all east valley foodies.  See you there!"}
{"text":"Something different... not a new favorite for me but maybe it was the item I chose. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great food and plenty of it....tap beer was cold and fresh....staff was attentive . The sweet potato fries are  the best we had ever had. The place is a little hard to find as it is actually located in a courtyard just West of their  Gilbert Road street address. Their signage does not help find them either...very small. But we will be back, next time with visiting friends..."}
{"text":"Wow! Everything sounded and looked delicious! We tried the rancher and sweet lou's bbq, both were yummy! The kids had a grilled cheese, and mac and cheese. My 6 year old gave it a 5, and said, \"the food was really good. The grilled cheese and mac and cheese were really good, and the s'mores. And so was the root beer.\" My 4 year old said, \"the grilled cheese was really good. And also, the s'mores didn't taste like ice cream but it was good.\" (They made me type that, lol!) Service was good, staff was very friendly and helpful with our questions. We were very pleased and will be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food was pretty much awful - I ordered some kind of \"Power Salad\" that - when it arrived at my table - looked more like a bowl full of cow's vomit !  Cost me a lot of money to figure out quick that I will NOT EVER darken THIS place's doors- again !!!!!  YUK with a CAPITAL Y !!!"}
{"text":"Ambience: Walking into this restaurant, it feels very modern and new. Very nicely done. There is outdoor seating and an indoor outdoor type bar area. The only negative thing is the location. It's hidden from a lot of other popular places in Downtown Gilbert and I hope this doesn't affect sales and traffic.   Customer Service: It's a seat yourselves concept. The gentleman behind the counter explained how the restaurant worked and what was popular. I'm not a fan of the seat yourself but it works for them.   Food: What I ordered was pretty delicious. Wha can be bad about a grilled mac and cheese sandwich with tomato caprese on top. I'm only basing this review on that one item. I'd go back and try something else.   Drinks: I took part in their $1 Corona special. They did have beer on tap which looked awesome too.   Restrooms: Clean. 1 person per restroom and they have a separate male/female."}
{"text":"If this place charged double is still be happy. Fresh ingredients and the flavors are on point.  I'm a tough critic and I eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Quick Quality Quantity Fresh and DELICIOUS!  Had the Notorious R.I.B. with 1/2 roasted veggies and 1/2 waffle fries.  The beef was succulent and tender. The veggies were roasted perfectly. You could taste the freshness in every bite. Waffle fries!! Who does not love waffle fries? YUM! Everything perfectly seasoned and the horseradish crema is the perfect ticket to take that whole train to Flavor Town!! We were in a hurry for a to go order during our meal break. We ordered online, parked in the happy space near the door reserved for carry out orders (nice touch!) and our order was waiting when we arrived. GREAT SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight with a large group of about 25 people. We called ahead and they were very accommodating setting aside some tables for our group all together. The staff was very helpful patient and friendly. The environment was fun and clean. The food was also fantastic. I got the grub stack and my wife got the nacho stack. Both were excellent and we also enjoyed the 2 Desert stacks as we ordered several to share with our group. Several other plates that were ordered by our group looked amazing as well.  Nobody in our group had been here before so this was a rookie experience for all of us but everyone was very impressed. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We were in the area and looking for something different since the west side has NOTHING like this. It's definitely different, but oh so good! When we walked in there was no line and the employee who was taking orders was super friendly and explained to us exactly how it worked! I ordered the Nacho Stak and my boyfriend ordered the Grubstak. The nacho one was sooooo good! The meat had soooo much flavor. Everything about my stak was delicious! It's definitely different as the base is waffle fries instead of chips, but you can't go wrong with fries! My bf said his was okay, he wished there was more meat. The service and food was great!!"}
{"text":"Love the new concept and location in downtown Gilbert! Tried the Signature Lou's BBQ stak today and it was perfect! Lots of great menu choices and liked the kid friendly options. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place on a whim on Friday. We were not disappointed! Friendly staff and the food was great. We will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"I Love fries!!!! I was excited to try this place and everything was awesome. Large portions and very filling and so delicious. Service was great also."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place; insanely good and I told all my friends and family... that sweet bbq and Mac n cheese my lordddddd"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I did like that they had a create your own, but with that being said I thought I was enhancing my experience by adding the mac n cheese that most original dishes already contained. The mac n cheese didn't taste like anything. The \"chicken\" (aka chicken nuggets) weren't flavorful and the bbq sauce tasted cheap and a little off. The fries by themselves were pretty standard waffle fries."}
{"text":"Food is delicious at nearly half of the price of most other options surrounding it. This is a fantastic local eatery with the style and poise of a chain. Service was also outstanding."}
{"text":"Not awful food but it's sort of glorified chili cheese fries. Good for what it is but I wish there was more items to choose from. We felt like we just ate appetizers for our meal."}
{"text":"We popped in for brunch and I had the chicken and waffle stak. The waffles are some amazing combo between a waffle and a croissant. Just the right combo of sweet and savory! He had the French toast stak and before I could ask him how he liked it, it was GONE! That would be the best compliment from a dude! ;)  We will definitely be back to try lunch!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the croissant waffles (my fiancé said they are probably the best waffles he has ever had). My daughter ordered the Grubstak and said it was the best breakfast she ever had because it came with waffle fries, ha. I ordered Huevos Rancheros, absolutely delicious especially considering that it came with waffle fries and not the traditional way. Our toddler got the kids French toast and it was a perfect portion size for him and also delicious. The customer service was phenomenal. I spilled my drink and they were very friendly about cleaning it up right away, and even gave me a Mimosa at no charge."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Clean and friendly staff. The parking garage close too.   Rancheros stack delicious!!"}
{"text":"Was so curious that we made the drive from Arcadia and it was totally worth it! I had the power salad with mushrooms, which was fresh, tasty and wholesome. We had both deserts, the s'more and sweet as honey, and they were both delicious. In sum, great food, great service and refreshingly creative new concept!"}
{"text":"Really good flavors, tons of food. I would recommend sharing with someone. But cool vibes and the staff are very helpful and friendly. I like how you can make it as healthy or unhealthy as you want."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today and loved it! I tried their signature grubstack and it was delicious. The place is cute and kids friendly and the staff was very attentive and nice. We will definitely be back! They also have a brunch menu that I want to try!"}
{"text":"Great flavors, large meaty portions - I could definitely see this as a great cure for a hangover and a good meal!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT customer service!!! This is our first time eating at this awesome place. The food was healthy and filling. My husband and I ordered the Rancher and the Fun Guy which were both TASTY!!!We met the owner, Colton was very professional and answered all our questions. The staff was very attentive. This place is a good addition to the Gilbert Heritage District!!!"}
{"text":"There was not one thing we didn't like! The food was awesome and the staff was even better!!! We tried 2 different stacks and a salad and now want to try one of everything!!! I only wish we had taken pictures to show you the deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"I love their concept! The waffle fries are delicious and the veggies are too! Their prices are great especially since most restaurants at downtown Gilbert are overpriced. On Tuesdays kids eat for free so that's definitely a plus for parents. I'm glad we found this place! It's been consistently delicious!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered GrubStak about 4 months ago. We've been in a number of times and tried about half the menu. We have always been super pleased with the flavors and the variety on the menu. Portions are very generous, but not absurdly huge (if you're light eaters you can easily split a dish).  Knowing that we had an event coming up, we thought it would be great to see if they might be able to accommodate a group of 35 for a casual get together. They said \"absolutely.\"  Colton, the owner, put together a couple of extremely fair priced options for us to choose from. This included setting aside a portion of the dining room for our group. We decided on our food options (served in a well organized buffet styled layout). We chose our option and left the rest up to Colton and his staff.  Our event was last night. It went perfectly!! Everyone loved the food, the staff, and the casual atmosphere. I can't say enough about their hospitality. Thank you Colton and staff!  Update: Their Brunch is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great concept, and great options. I love downtown Gilbert and this is a great alternative. I just wish the restaurant was closer to the main street, I'm worried it will go out of business if it's hidden back in the parking lot!  Options for people with food allergies are available"}
{"text":"If something is worth doing in life, it is worth doing well. Unfortunately, Grubstak doesn't do it well....  The basis is simple. Make waffle fries and throw whatever food you want on top of them. But in this simplicity lies a flaw, if something is so simple, why can't it be fresh? The meal is throw together in minutes, but the only thing fresh about the ingredients are that they're fresh out of the freezer. I ordered the Chicken Parm waffle fries. Pretty easy right? The meal tasted fine, but just lacked any real flavor which was terrible unfortunate as it looked excellent. The chicken tasted like they just microwaved some banquet chicken nuggets and threw some other stuff on it. I can't say the meal was bad, but it just wasn't what it could be if they spent some time throwing on fresh, delicious ingredients. The meal is simple, so make those easy ingredients delicious to make a great and unique meal.   Just a note, the server brought out our plates and said they were hot. I paid heed to what the server said, but accidentally bumped my arm against it. I now have a sizable burn mark on my wrist. Maybe the plate was too hot to bring out to the customer, especially if it were a child..."}
{"text":"This place was good!! I wish that for a family of 5 they had some inexpensive options like Even Stevens offers next door.  But overall, flavors were on point. Good grub for sure!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious. I was kind of skeptical of how a mound of mixed food could be that good, but by far one of the best places I have eaten in Mesa/Gilbert. It's such a novel concept and it is nice to eat something different. It's fairly well priced for the amount of food you get, especially with how tasty it is. The customer service was great; all the workers were friendly and helpful. The place is well decorated and has good tunes playing. Everything about it makes it a five star location."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. A quick meal to fill up between jobs for my hubbs. Nothing super special. Food was good. Combinations of flavors were spot on. The beef way better than the chicken."}
{"text":"Delicious. The food is very fresh and creative. The service is friendly and helpful. Lots of gluten free options."}
{"text":"Outstanding service with a tasty and unique menu. The menu allows for many unique combinations for everyone in the family. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Try out the mac & cheese grilled cheese sandwich! It's INCREDIBLE. I have yet to recreate anything at home that comes close to being as good as this."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a try! My family and I got a few different things off of the menu and everything tasted great! The menu is very inventive too. I haven't tried anything like it before. The staff is also super nice! The owner even gave us a free dessert and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love it here, i always get the root veggies with roasted chicken and balsamic it's wonderful! The customer service is great as well."}
{"text":"Great concept and locally owned, love both. Will def be back. I had the Grubstak with eggs cooked to perfection and a nice hef from Barrio.  Owner is very friendly. Great food!!!"}
{"text":"What a great spot. I wish we lived closer, I would go all the time.  We came with a large group on a weekday early evening and pretty much had the place to ourselves. There is a good amount of seating and we were able to get our group of 10 all together with no problem. You order at the counter so there was no rush to order...we were able to take it easy and get a few beers before we decided to order.  I had the Rancher with half waffle fries, half roasted vegetables. It was delicious. My only complaint is there was some liquid from the chicken that gathered on the bottom of the bowl and my fries were soggy before I had a chance to finish them. Not a huge deal, I just have an aversion to soggy food. Annnyyywho....My kids shared the Nacho Stak, someone had the Chillax, another made their own, there were a couple mac and cheese kids meals in there, Possibly a Notorious R.I.B. Everyone only had good things to say. We were too full for dessert but it looks AMAZING!!  Grubstak has a happy hour and a beer club punch card. After so many you get a beer for a penny (I think). Again...I wish I lived closer. *insert sad face here*  I started talking about this place when I went to work the next day and someone checked it out right away and was pleased as well. There are so many places popping up in Gilbert, I hope Grubstak is here to stay!"}
{"text":"Lots of love and attention. I prefer stronger flavors but the balance was good. Tried almost everything on the menu.   French toast was great, all the breakfast stacks were good but a little more bacon and spices would be nice. Sausage for example low on sage, pepper not that strong, etc. BBQ was nice, parsnips added a nice surprise. Basically really simple consistent food. Coffee is just like basic drip, but the tea was good.    Desert snore was meh, nice touch with the torch tho. Hate being asked for tips at the register. It's casual dining. In general I say just charge me more for the meal and pay your people. If they offer poor service - fire them."}
{"text":"This place was great! The interior design is nice, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly, and they were quick. It's really nice to go somewhere where they don't chuckle when you ask for something vegan. I asked the man at the front if he could recommend something with no dairy or meat for me, and he recommended the Grubatouille with no Parmesan on the zucchini, and no other dairy. I also subbed the tomato sauce (which has dairy) with their house made ranchero sauce, and did regular waffle fries. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last week based on the reviews! Super adorable place! Service was great and quick and good was fresh! Great place to try! Definitely a different place to try it's out of the typical go to places for lunch! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Train your staff to be more customer service oriented!!!   We walked in on a Friday evening and the place was practically empty.  Two ladies were behind the counter and one said she would be right with us, then turned her back like she was trying to figure some paperwork out. The other lady was standing uncomfortably like she didn't know what to do and ignored us like we weren't there.  There were three guys standing around in the kitchen waiting for orders.  Needless to say, after 5 minutes of standing there being ignored, we left.  No wonder there was hardly anyone there."}
{"text":"Not making a trip back. Visited w a group of 6 ppl...  chicken came out cold on one meal when it was suppose to be hot, I just went simple w a grilled cheese(no better than a typical home made one), 2 did enjoy their meal....    Staff was very nice though!!!!"}
{"text":"Here right now!! First time here, not too busy, food came out pretty quick. Food was good, not a lot of value, as two dishes with a soda and beer came out to a little over $28. Not complaining too much about it, because the food seems to have quality. Wife got the Gold Rush, I did a custom, fries, black bean chili and cheddar. I ate mine pretty quick, wife could finish hers. If we coke back, I'm going to get something that has the chicken in it, it looked amazing. Just gonna sit here a bit and finish the beer."}
{"text":"Stopped by here before a show at the Hale Theatre.  The food was extremely good and the restaurant was very clean.  I had their signature grubstak bowl and it was amazing!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place popped up in a suggestion for a great place to eat. And looking at the pictures, it blew my mind even more. So after work, I immediately drove down, picked up my buddy and went to it. My eyes were caught on the classic Grubstak, and oh my goodness. The food was super and so delicious. I never knew something so simple would be so delicious. The fries, bacon, cheese and the egg on top. Perfect combo. Would recommend this place. So worth it."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places I have ever eaten at in my life.  I had their chicken and waffles and it made me gag at how much it all blended together. The food took forever to come out and it was completely soggy. I was so incredibly hungry so I kept eating and it just got worse with every bite. For a recommended item, I can't even imagine how horrible the meals that aren't recommended are. The rest of my party was very disappointed as well. No one liked their food and we all tried something different. DO NOT waste your time with this place it was repulsive. My little brother could make better food with his eyes closed."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Who thought of this concept?!?! Sooooo brilliant!!! We had the Mac Attack, and the Grubstak. Whoa. If I lived near here, I'd weight a million pounds. Damn, this was GOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the concept.  But I agree with a previous review about the selections being overwhelming and being confused about what goes well together.  So we chose two dishes that were already created (Grubstak and the Lou Stack).  We felt they had a lot of potential but found they were not very savory.  The sauces needed some help.  It was an ok experience, but doubt we'd go back."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! A great and original restaurant! Left full and feeling great!"}
{"text":"These dishes are unique but SO BOMB. The meat that comes with it is amazing and the waffle fries add to it makes a good meal! They have all kinds of stacks and they're all good. (I've had them all). Every time I'm in Down Town Gilbert, i love stopping by this place :)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite local restaurants! The food is absolutely delicious! We love the power salad with an egg added or the chillax, which has house made chilli atop slow braised beef and waffle fries, basically the best chilli fries you will ever have in your life. The s'mores bread pudding is to die for too!"}
{"text":"We have had a friend suggesting this place for months. Finally we decided to stop in for dinner to-go. I had a hard time wrapping my head around the menu but was excited to start simple and go from there.   I ordered the grilled cheese stack and the fiance ordered the rancher with some substitutions and avocado.   We got home and first thing, he finds two hairs in his meal and no avocado. Then I opened mine and it was just a sandwich with some stuff on the side and some tomato soup. I was hoping for a little more direction on how the whole thing was at least supposed to be put together. No complaints on the grilled cheese but very confused on the rest.   The rancher was mediocre flavor and apparently not up to what he was hoping for. Overall, we probably won't go back except for that smores thing - that would be worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place as waffle fries are one of my favorite things! They have some dishes that are staples for them but you can also build your own and choose your type of fries, meat, cheese, sauce, and adds one like egg and avocado.   They also have other items in the menu like grilled cheese and such. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"We love Grubstak! A little hidden, but so good. Their kids meals are a good value, and they offer a tasty dessert for your birthday."}
{"text":"Value and quality, basically the best things you can hope for when it comes to a restaurant and this place has both. Went on a Tuesday and my kids ate free, and their kids meals were some of the best I have seen at any establishment be it fast, casual, full service or otherwise. Wife had the caprese which I tried, was an excellent \"meal\" version of the salad. I ordered the traditional Grubstak that was delicious, however it would be better at brunch and preferably with a bloody mary. We will be back."}
{"text":"I will need to give this place another try, but for someone who doesn't like all their food and sauces touching, this wasn't a place for me. As the name implies, the food is stacked on top of waffle fries (regular or sweet potato) and the food is based on what you order. While each component of my order was tasteful separate, together, it was a bit off, and not my favorite. Its an interesting concept and Im sure, is a great addition to the downtown Gilbert scene, but I definitely need to try this place out again to give it one more try. Ample parking with the parking structure just adjacent in location, but a little tucked away from the main Gilbert Road drag of restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is really cool, very nice place, good vibe. The staff is really nice. Food was pretty good, we liked it mostly because it is unique, not because it is great. We'll go again, mostly to try the desserts!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my brothers birthday. The food was really good! We ordered the bbq beef fries and the grilled cheese with tomato soup. The grilled cheese was so so but the fries were delicious! Really cool atmosphere, really friendly service!   We came in with a large party and were able to make a reservation no problem."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to expect and wanted to try something new for Sunday brunch.   The staff was great, the food was excellent.   Husband said \"this place is a keeper\"."}
{"text":"I wanted to love tho place because the concept is what I absolutely love. Stacking flavors & textures of different foods. This place fell flat. All you taste is the bottom layer which is starch. I kept going back tried several different dishes but the flavors were NEVER there and I always got the same result. Never tasted the veggies or protein. The presentation is deceiving, a stainless steel bowl that looks awesome but is so boring no matter how or what angle you try, eat it as presented, mix it up, still doesn't work. Once you take out the bottom layer you realize umm there's like a quarter cup if that of the  main ingredients. After 6 visits I finally figured out this place isn't for me no matter how much I wanted to love it. The one star is for the service which wasn't great even on the non peak hours. Oh yeah did I say extremely over priced"}
{"text":"This place rocks!!!! We have been there a few times - the food is really good and huge portions. But come for the food come back for the staff.  They do everything to make your meal perfect!!"}
{"text":"We eat here a lot. Mostly to go. And they are so fast with take out orders. The food is always ready when I get there and I order it and then immediately leave to go get it. They have a takeout parking spot right up from which makes it so easy.  The great part of this is that my whole family likes this place, even my teenage daughter and she's super hard to please.  I normally order the sweet baby Lou's but this time I got the power salad.  It was huge and delicious.  We will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"I regret passing by this place so many times!  The name didn't appeal to me so I never looked into the menu.  Then a friend wanted to try it out and I actually looked into it. Waffle Fries with toppings?!  Yum!    Our group for dinner consisted of about 20 people and I don't believe anyone had been there before.  The cashier was great at explaining how it works, answering questions and making suggestions based on our likes.  I was one of the last people to order so I can say that the line went really fast.    After ordering food we put some table together and sat down to eat.  Food started coming out and everything looked amazing!  We were checked on several times to ensure we satisfied.  They really went above and beyond to serve us!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday evening, and it was surprisingly empty! The outside and inside is very beautiful and clean, there's tvs, and it just has a good atmosphere. We ordered three staks, and they were all really good! You get a lot of food for the price so it's a good deal. They also have brunch on the weekends, and I definitely want to come back and try it!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today. There weren't many people there which was a reprieve from the crazy crowds elsewhere in downtown Gilbert. The food was delicious. I had the chicken waffle stack and my husband had the rancheros. He said his was good but not great (nothing special about it). Mine was awesome. The waffles themselves were flakey and flavorful. Not your traditional waffle in a good way! My only complaint was that there wasn't much chicken so I actually ordered a kids meal to fill up more (and I'm only 5'1\"). We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is good.  Great wholesome good and plenty of it.  Refreshing decor. Great place to watch the game and have a few brews. Nice people trying to make the customer happy. I tried the signature dish and found it very satisfying while my friend had the vegetarian offering that was different and pleasant.  A worthy addition to a wonderful restaurant area ."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT. Staff was professional and inviting, food was KILLER, like OUTSTANDING (not just for the price) and the atmosphere is light and fun. The food really blew me away -- for reference I got the Notorious R.I.B and my wife got the Sweet Lou's BBQ. 10/10 would recommend and will return."}
{"text":"so went in just looking for something we havent had before dwntwn gilbert and found a hidden gem. this place is AMAZING!!!clean good food friendly service the owner Cole was so helpful cause we had no clue what to pick and our picky kids were with us.. French toast stak perfection for my lil munchkins the grubstak with both types of fries(potatoes) perfection!!! we have found a new place to get our grub on!!!"}
{"text":"I want to cry because this place is so good. It seems like a simple concept, but the recipes are to die for. It is seriously so good. It's a bit expensive so we always share a plate, but great atmosphere, great staff, clean, and amazing food!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok for me! Not enough meat! You are expected to get full off of waffle fries. It would have been better with more chicken and possibly more veggies. Great food if you need some late night carbs from drinking though!"}
{"text":"Omg this place blew me away! I had the mac attack, Grinch fries, and smore's dessert. Everything was amazing, but the shishito pesto and mac and cheese were killer! I would gladly travel any distance to eat here again. What an amazing addition to Gilbert. Thank you Grubstak!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. Will be back to try more food out. Great location. My only concern was my eggs were a tiny bit underdone."}
{"text":"Ok at best. In between 2 and 3 stars but I'll round up to 3. Went on a Sunday for lunch. Menu looked good, but for a casual order at counter type place the prices seemed high. I wanted a beer but the alcohol prices were some of the highest I've seen anywhere in town so that ruled that out. We ordered a mushroom veggie stack with side pork added, and the golden chicken stack (not 100% sure that is its name but the chicken/fries with gold sauce).   Food was decent. The portion of chicken was shockingly small, and fries were room temp. Dish overall was room temp. While the fries were good, and chicken with sauce was good, the overall dish just didn't work. It was missing something to tie it together. The portion for the price was disappointing. Good thing my wife thought he mushroom one was greasy and pretty gross so I could eat a good amount of hers. The veggies were ok but same thing as the other stax, not a cohesive meal, and it was really greasy/oily. For a $35 lunch for 2, there are at least 10 other choices within downtown Gilbert that are superior.  If the prices came down 30% or so I would try it again, but for now I'll go to any where else in downtown Gilbert before Grubstak"}
{"text":"YUMMY! I just had the \"Rancher\" with Veggies and I couldn't be happier. Everything was fresh, tasty and wonderful."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant.  It was really different, oddly it tasted better warmed up the next day.  Who knows why."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Very informative and attentive staff. The food was really good and came out quick! Interesting and fun concept! Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed trying this new restaurant in Gilbert. It had options for just about anyone including vegetarian or gluten free. I had the Veggitouie with an aka carte order of grilled chicken that was very tasty and filling. My hubby had the Chillax which was a black bean version of chili fries. He liked it as well. The service was great and the food came out quickly. It was also nice and clean."}
{"text":"Overall A+ experience at Grubstak.  Started with the extremely friendly staff and ended with a delicious meal.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was doubtful about eating here because it just didn't sound like it would be that good or unique. Boy was I wrong! First, the service was friendly, patient and informative. Being the first trip there for both of us, we had to ponder the menu a bit. I decided to try the Grubatouille, hoping it wasn't TOO unhealthy and had decent flavor. It turned out to be DELICIOUS!  Delicious enough that I'm wondering if it really was unhealthy   My friend did a make your own, which she enjoyed. She did prefer my tomato cream sauce to whatever green sauce she started with, but she ate the entire dish so it must've been good. I also appreciated that they had green tea and it was really tasty!   My only request... can we get a nutrition/calorie count for those of us who are being calorie conscious?"}
{"text":"I thought this was a great concept, from the way they take your order to the way you leave.  We made it in time for brunch.  My girlfriend got chilaquiles which were fresh and delicious.  I got this breakfast bowl thing and it was so good.  Usually I don't eat bread, but this bread was fresh baked which I think made it easier to digest, who knows.    Decor and ambiance though were quite amazing.  I hope this place takes off, because it is a local business.  Observed the owner meeting and talking with tables.  Keep it up and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try the Grubstak tonight since it had such good reviews and every other restaurant had long lines. The menu was a bit confusing, but the cashier was helpful and steered us in a good direction. The food was promptly servered and the presentation was great. I had the Nortious and a salad and my husbsnd had the Gold Rush plus the tomato soup. The salad was huge and very good. We ended up sharing it. The soup was goods as well. The meat in both dishes was tender and moist. The food was good and about average price for dinner, but the atmosphere is that of a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"We were walking around downtown and ran in to this place. We are so glad we gave it a try! It was really quick and the bbq I got was to die for! I did half waffle fries and half veggies as the base. I subbed the coleslaw for the Mac and cheese and was in heaven. My husband ordered the Rancher. It wasn't his favorite (I tried a bite and thought it was good) so they replaced it with the chicken parm without hesitation. The chicken parm was delicious! I do recommend getting half fries and have veggies because getting all fries is honestly a ton of fries! It was a very complete meal for a decent price in downtown Gilbert! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"So good. Service is awesome and food has huge portions!!!!! Their breakfast is to die for and their mimosas are champagne with OJ for color (just the way I like them!)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Apache Junction and used Yelp to help us find a place to have lunch. Toward the top of the list was Grubstak, 13 miles away. Huh!? That's not close!  We decided to take a chance, make the ride (on our motorcycles), and have lunch there. Between the close, covered parking, great ambiance and delicious food I'd say we made a great choice! The golden chicken with golden sauce on a bed of sweet and regular potato waffle fries was so wonderful.  We look forward to coming back and trying many other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here his week. Service was really good. The beer card is cool. The food was ok. I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Grubstak's concept is simple: take an already delicious food and use that as a base for layers upon layers of other delicious food. Well, seven deadly sins be damned, because gluttony tastes so right.   The menu has a nice variety of veg-friendly and carnivore-pleasing options with combinations ranging from relatively healthy to total guilty pleasure.   I chose to be good and got the grubatouille. The squash was perfectly cooked and the base of roasted parsnips, carrots, potatoes, and broccoli were incredibly fresh. The accompanying tomato sauce rounded out the dish well. I also got a side of the 50/50 fries, because nobody should ever turn down the opportunity to have two kinds of waffle fries.   Grubstak is a great new addition to the quick meal options around Gilbert!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were out running errands and decided to stop somewhere near by.  Pleasantly surprised and was great food, great service and loved the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in GRUBSTAK and it was amazing. Right when I walked in I was greeted by all the staff on the floor, the friendly atmosphere continued through out my dine in experience. Not to mention that it smelled amazing in the restaurant and it was definitely clean. Timothy which was the cashier explained to me how everything worked on the menu and how to set up my order. When Michael brought out my food he was very courteous and Attentive and came back a few times to make sure everything was to my liking. The food was amazing on its own, can't wait to come back and try out some more things on their menu. Definitely recommending this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! I usually eat here once a week, I really like the protein power plate and add a fried egg on top. Staff is always super friendly and they always have new combos to try. Brunch, lunch or dinner, it's always a good time for grubstack. If you want to get wild, try the Mac n cheese sandwich with the tomato soup."}
{"text":"A very unique twist of home style comfort ingredients. Fresh take and very delicious!! Everything we had was amazing including the s'mores dessert!! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Novelty yes, but gourmet or refined flavors, no. This is probably a four star if you like bar food.  My wife puts it at a 4 four.  Shes a pig, lol.  Good food, great bbq sauce, just a bit too conveyor belt."}
{"text":"Wow! What a unique idea for food. Having a base of waffle fries (50/50 potato and sweet potato) is genius! I got the Chillax Signature Stak and my husband got the Mac Attack Grubchetta and boy were we both satisfied. Incredible flavors and the serving sizes were fair for the price (wouldn't mind it being just a bit less for a bit of a smaller portion, actually). I wanted to get one of their Sweet Staks for dessert but was too full! We will be back to try dessert and their brunch options. 7.15.17"}
{"text":"I like this concept of food. The pre-designed choices are great, or get creative and build your own stack. The food is tasty.  I don't think there was enough \"wet\" for my stack of waffle fries. The alcohol choices are limited. The stacks are served in a very hot pan - dangerous for young kids. It's a half breed between fast food/ self- serve and wait service. I hate that."}
{"text":"I really liked the sweet potato waffle fries. They were crisp and delicious. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Stopped by this downtown Gilbert spot for lunch with a friend. We were very impressed by the quantity and quality of the choices. Fully customizable meals and suggested combinations. Every bite was delicious!  Kept eating even though I was full. Soooooooo good."}
{"text":"Great choices, staff and atmosphere. I had the ranchero? I don't know it was a breakfast option and it was super amazing. The staff is extra nice and outgoing."}
{"text":"First time in the Gilbert area and tried out this place - it's amazing! Very cool concept they got going especially with the build your own stack option."}
{"text":"Clean nice new place.  The food was flavorful however the sweet potato fries were cold and chewy.  The fries are the first main component of the meal so it left me disappointed.    Friend ordered the breakfast bowl and was pleased.   My father also ordered a dish that had sweet potato fries and he experienced the same thing.  COLD CHEWY FRIES !    If I return I'll order a different base.  Lettuce or veggies."}
{"text":"One of the best tasting dinners I've ever had.  Absolutely amazing food like I've never seen in my 44 years of life.  Incredible flavors layered one after another.  I will be back...and so should you."}
{"text":"Great food, with so many options for dietary needs like bowls packed with high protein and easy digestible veggie or sweet potato base. Service is always great and fast.  My wife loves the options to get wine or mimosas, I love the beer options."}
{"text":"Four of ate there, and two liked their pick and the other two did not.  We also ordered one dessert between us.  S'mores.  Shouldn't of wasted our money.  It was $6.75 and it really wasn't very good and not worth the money.  Bread pudding on the bottom, doesn't that sound good?  Very hard and dense and the fudge sauce was like Hersey syrup and then marshmallows and bruleed marshmallow which I believe was the marshmallow in the jar put under the broiler.  I think they could really improve on some of their menu items  I got the chicken parm with root veggies that were not done.  Do you enjoy hard carrots (over abundance of carrots) and underdone purple potatoes with one piece of broccoli. Tiny bit of sauce and some cheese with chicken nuggets.  Need I say more.    Some of their items are probably pretty good if you pick it right and if you like waffle fries.  And maybe if you pick your own, you might get lucky."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my order. The food was stale. It tasted and looked like it had been out for days. I am hoping for a refund, but have not heard back."}
{"text":"Had the Italian bowl it was awesome.  I like the atmosphere and gluten free options for my wife."}
{"text":"I ordered the power salad bowl and was NOT impressed. It was advertised as a root vegetable bowl and there were 5 beets and 2 slices of potatoes. Seriously. The rest was broccoli and a ton of shredded chicken and Parmesan. The portions are HUGE so you get a bang for your buck but you're better off going to the burger joint down a few doors down."}
{"text":"I love fries so I had been eyeing this place for sometime. I'm happy to now report that I finally made it in. Also to note, I will be back! I mean let's be honest, you can't go wrong with waffle cut fries. Or maybe you can... but not here!  This place is unique. Our service was very friendly and warm. Since it was our first time in we were given some pointers and recommendations of which were both very delicious. I ordered the Rancher as is and he got the Sweet Lou's BBQ - sub coleslaw for mac & cheese on half sweet potato, half regular fries. Major key there, guys! Now best part (of many, tbh!) they serve your food on the coolest pans ever! I was kinda in awe over those and you can just tell they put in so much thought towards the details of this joint!  When one of the staffers came around to make sure everything was tastin' good, she noticed I was shamefully picking off the green onions (not listed on the menu). To my relief, she was a fellow onion hater and told me to just make sure I request them off next time. Yes, there will still be a next time and boy do I love a good backing towards my onion loathe.  Until we Grub again..."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I love the idea of stacking and making it to your personal liking. Friendly, great service! At a glance it doesn't look filling, but will surprise you."}
{"text":"Great food. I was visiting and this place was recommended. Very happy with the choice. The service was okay. It was busy so probably was the reason but overall would give a 9 and would Go back."}
{"text":"Such good food, and a little different concept which was fun (and no wait times in downtown Gilbert made it all worth it!) awesome service too!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Downtown Gilbert! Incredible salads, sandwiches and 'stacks.' Friendly service and clean, casual atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! Totally different concept that you can't get anywhere else. My friends and I came here on a Friday night around 6:30 and there was hardly a line at all which is a huge plus. We were confused about what to order, but the girl at the counter was so nice and explained everything to us. She gave us some great recommendations for first timers. I got the Rancher with waffle fries, my friends got the BBQ chicken salad and the Gold Rush stak with waffle fries. All three were pretty good! Mine needed just a little bit more flavor though. Like I wasn't blown away by how good it was. I will probably be back to try something else and bring my fiancé cause he would be totally in to this!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here due to 1 hour waits at other area restaurants.  Going to the Hale Theatre, so didn't have all night, come on! But...beautiful weather, so everyone and their hungry cousin were out tonight. SO pleasantly surprised and pleased with the concept and the food, we will be back again! One of our party had the Power Salad, 2 had the Sweet Louis BBQ with a couple of tweaks, I had the Grubatoillie with chicken added. All was very tasty, good sized portions, hot, delicious. This may be our new go-to before the play! A must-try!!"}
{"text":"We didn't really know how to order when we first walked in, but the staff is super friendly and obviously very used to walking you through the process. What's offered here reminds me a little of a breakfast skillet on steroids, with all the cheesy, meaty, veggie punch you could ask for. You can build them from your picks, or go with one of their masterful suggestions. I figured my best choice would be to go with their namesake and get the \"Grubstak\". It was a good choice: cheese, sausage, and crisp bacon piled high atop sweet potato waffle fries and roasted root vegetables. Lots of flavors and textures here, and it's the kind of comfort food that's easy to enjoy. My boss had the Notorious RIB, which he really enjoyed. We shared some avocado toast, which was creamy and rich on thick cut bread. Very good! Really felt like it was a good value for all you get. Next time I might be adventurous and build my own. Atmosphere is cool and contemporary. You order at the counter and they bring your food to you. Beers on tap too. Definitely a place that is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Not very good. Not sure why there are so many good reviews. My waffle fries were so dry. My husbands chicken parm wasn't good either. Not impressed at all. Not worth the cost either."}
{"text":"I ordered RIB with waffle fries and S'more please dessert on the phone. It was ready  when I got there. I personally love Horse radish and it went great with meal. They also have veteran discount so I saved a little cash. Awe Some spot."}
{"text":"Definitely a little pricier than I was expecting, but the good was great! Big portions, which is really nice. The standout of my visit was the music, though, great great great playlist!"}
{"text":"Have dined here twice and both meals were wonderful. The food is freshly prepared, plentiful and tasty. What more can you ask for? Today I had the chicken parmesan stack. The vegetables and potatoes were not over cooked and the chicken was topped with a flavorful marinara sauce. It's a quick food restaurant that does it right. Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!! OMG delicious!!! A very unique place with a lot of choices and delicious meals. Grubstak is doing it right.  Beautiful ambiance and good quality ingredients...this place is great if you are trying to eat clean. My husband and I loved it and wish we had one of these in STL."}
{"text":"Ordered the Notorious R.I.B. 1/2 reg fried 1/2 veggies for myself and a side of Mac & Cheese for my son. Both were tasty and plenty of food to share. I like my horseradish cream sauce stronger than most so next time I'll ask for some of the fresh horseradish too. Was a little disappointment with the veggies. It was mostly potatoes. I was expecting more carrots, broccoli and other fresh vegetables. Overall it was a pleasant dinner. The staff was friendly & helpful, the dining area & restroom was clean, the vibe & decor were unique. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Finger licking good! From start to finish this place had me. You walk in and the edgy feel with good decor and a menu that has great options let's ya know right away something special is probably brewing in that kitchen. I'm typically down to try anything new but my wife explained this place as, \"babe you'll like this place bc you mix your food in huge piles all the time so you'll like it. Not sure how to take that but, if someone is gonna make money off the idea than sure I'll try it.  My wife got the nacho bowl with half veggies and half waffle fries. My chubby arse almost ate her entire bowl before she got a bite (sorry babe ). The veggies alone with the purple potatoes and yellow carrots (if my mind is right) was worth the bowl alone. On to my dish, which I gotta be honest I just asked them to surprise me and they did. I got a BBQ type bowl with and Apple type coleslaw. Normally I hate coleslaw but this had a great balance of flavor and not an oversaturation of mayo or whatever coleslaw is made from. The sauce on mine was mouth drueling awesome. My daughter, who is rather picky, ate all my waffle fries which is probably good bc I'm working on the ol dad bod. Not sure where I heard of this place but you can bet I'll be back to try their pizza bowl bc who doesn't love pizza in a bowl?! The staff was great too."}
{"text":"Coke not Pepsi - Cool unique and tasty!  It's location likely dooms it (between the garage and other restaurants on Gilbert rd) but it's unique and different. I was in Melbourne last fall and ate at a place which had as its base fresh baked potatoes - you guys should try that!   It seems an easy option based on the current product line up."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant. I really enjoyed the food. At the time I was in the mood for poutine and this was the closest I found. I ordered 50/50 mix of fries topped with their braised short rib. It was good but nothing great. I think everyone should try it once.  For me it wasn't anything new and exciting."}
{"text":"Place is nice, service is good, and the concept seems solid.   That said I was completely underwhelmed by the grub stack.  It looked fantastic.  It was served hot and fast.   It was just meh.  I had a taste of my wife's and daughter's orders.  Same feeling.  Uninspiring."}
{"text":"Holy cow.   Great food. Huge portions. Not your ordinary fare in the least. Spotless environment, combined with fast, friendly service and great food. It's a winner!  I did not even know this location existed.  This little square is behind all of the main street things on Gilbert Road.  The south side of the square looks like it is still under construction. So it is about as camouflaged as a business setting can be.   Venture inside the square, and you will find Grubstak, and a reason to avoid the main street crowds.  Then you will come back."}
{"text":"Wow! Hubby and I ended up here cuz our Plan A had too long of a wait. YAY for us! The concept is fun, the portions are very big, and dang was it GOOD!  Hubby had the Grubstak (basically a breakfast dish) and digged it, especially the pork belly/bacon. I had the Golden (ha I forget the rest of the name!) which was a non-spicy buffalo chicken experience. Delightful and delicious! Service was terrific, too. We will definitely return! This is their first location. I wish them much success!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place.  Clean, fun and relaxed atmosphere.  Food was cold and flavorless.  Got the Grubatouille and the red sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce.  The Power salad was the same way.  The pesto had no flavor.  Literally left full plates on the table and walked out.  Couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place yesterday for the first time and were pleasantly surprised! Great atmosphere, delicious and unique dishes, and great service. The kids mac n cheese was out of this world! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times and while I am at a loss as to how to describe it , this place has a truly unique menu and the food is really good."}
{"text":"A busy Saturday night out with my 3 Littles who were hungry. We needed to get in somewhere quickly so we came to grubstack. The kids loved their meals but I didn't care too much for mine. I informed an employee who apologized and brought out a menu so I could replace my meal. The replacement meal, the Power salad, was so much better! Additionally, the customer service here was great and much appreciated! Got in and out with good food and excellent service! We'll come back again"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place and was pretty disappointed. I ordered the gold rush with 50/50 fries. The chicken was so dry. The wing sauce wasn't the best. Fries were good. I don't think I would dine there again. Great concept, but the food was just mediocre."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here the other night. The Sweet Lou's BBQ was amazing. I had waffle fries at the base, and my husband had half waffle fries, half mac and cheese. They were so good! I can't wait to go back and try some more dishes. This is a fun idea, and it's oh so tasty!!"}
{"text":"The concept here was attractive and the Yelp reviews were mostly positive so my wife and I and another couple gave it a try a week or so ago.  Can't say we were overwhelmed.  This is the new trendy fast-casual dining - order at a counter, plop yourself down at a table, and your food is brought out to you.  I always hate the ubiquitous tipping jar prominently displayed on the counter and the request for a tip on the computerized receipt one signs.  Why?  I don't tip the guy at Taco Bell, why should these people be treated better??  Anyway, to the food.  Myself and another guest ordered the Notorious R.I,B, bowl.  Don't be mislead.  Despite the menu description, rather than rib meat we got a hunk of pot roast.  Very striated and tough and chewy.  Nowhere near what I'd consider \"rib\" meat.  I was expecting something like braised rib meat, but no, just plain old overcooked pot roast.  Another person had the chicken parmesan bowl and felt the breading on the chicken bits was overly thick.  His bowl was essentially chicken McNuggets in a tomato sauce.  My wife had the Rancher, which she enjoyed and thought the chicken was good.  So, 3 outta 4 didn't care for the food.  Price was good as we walked out of there for less than $30.00.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the east valley, seriously can't say enough good things. The Notorious RIB is amazing and their cold brew coffee is worth the visit alone. Good atmosphere, good people, an absolute gem."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and reasonably priced. I got the power stack salad, hubby got the BBQ stack, and the kids shared the mac and cheese. I wish they had a Tucson location as that's where we live."}
{"text":"So good. My only complaint is I wish there was a bit more to the staks. It just seems to be meat and sauce on top of waffle fries. But as minimalistic as the food is it is full of flavor and very tasty."}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere.  Friendly and helpful staff.  We came in because of the friendly girl outside offering French toast stick samples.  Yum. The gentleman at the counter (colin i think ) was friendly,  knowledgeable and patient.  We each ordered frittatas. Mine the vegetable with 3 or 4 different type potatoes, refreshing tomatoes, and a tasty pesto to name a few ingredients all on an egg white fritata . The other a pork belly fritata came with a mini pork belly stuffed biscuit  and waffle frys. Yum. At $7.99each i found it affordable and healthy.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere! The no wait to get food was amazing for the area this place is in, always packed in Old Town Gilbert.   Fam and I got the huevos rancheros, chicken & waffles, and the kids Mac n Cheese and the food was bomb! Very filling so don't come here without being hungry.   Only con I had was the nitro coffee.. was pretty gross. Place is pricey but for all the food you get it's worth it.   Kudos to Grubstak I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Grubstak is delicious. Such a fun place to eat. They have unique choices and ways to have your food made. The food is delicious and the presentation is gorgeous. For sure my new favorite place."}
{"text":"We had the first one on the menu added Mac and cheese with waffle fries as base it was amazing ! Cheesy crunchy will come back want to try the bbq dish next time !"}
{"text":"Good food but maybe a little bit on the pricy side. But I also went with a large amount of professional pupils and I loved the environment it brought as well as the service"}
{"text":"Food here is very good, My personal favorite is the Mac Attack. Definitely recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"This is a really great concept. The location, the decor and the staff were all really great. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty! I've been here a few times and every option is good! I don't recommend the tomato soup tho, blahhhh. Always get a stack! But it's weird every time I go here I get a stomach ache after??"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try Grubstak for some time now so we went over the weekend. There weren't many people and this was on a Sunday at mid-day so that was nice. Everything on the menu looked delicious. With the help of the friendly lady at the counter, we decided on Sweet Lou's BBQ with sweet potato fries for my husband, Nachos with half sweet potato fries & roasted veggies for me, and the kid's pizza fries for our daughter.   We got our drinks and sat down with our number. The food was delivered promptly and in a large quantity. I liked that even though you order at the counter, you still have service throughout your stay. The food was flavorful and we enjoyed it. My only source of complaint was that some of my roasted veggies were not quite as tender as I would have liked but honestly, they were still good.  We will be back to try new combos and enjoy the fun, cool environment."}
{"text":"About 8 in our lunch group decided to try Grubstak, and all 8 really enjoyed it.  That says a lot for any restaurant!  It's a different take on comfort food.    First, you start with a base of either regular or sweet potato waffle fries.  Or, yes, roasted veggies as an alternative.  Next, choose a layer of chicken, beef, bacon, sausage, or pasta.  Choose a sauce and then one of four cheeses.    Half of us ordered the Gold Rush with crispy chicken and bleu cheese.  It was more food than any one of us could handle, so we all had leftovers for a late afternoon snack. The staks come in attractive silver colored bowls. Two others got the Nacho (barbacoa beef), and the last two had a soup and salad combo.  As I said, all had good things to say about lunch.    In addition to the usual line up of fountain drinks, Grubstak also sells beer and wine.  They have two unusual desserts, one involving waffle fries, cinnamon, and whipped cream.  Because of it's unusual combos -- and it's location in the highly popular historic Gilbert area --  this is a good place to bring out of town guests."}
{"text":"Didn't measure up. Waffles were burnt and chicken of the chicken and waffles were frozen nuggets. Great disappointment"}
{"text":"What a great concept!  Glad to finally try this newer eatery close to home. For a first visit, I tried the Rancher - great portion value!  Will definitely be back to try a few other menu items.  The owner was our order taker today, very hands on it appears - that's a plus for me for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is different from other restaurants and good. We've been a handful of times and I've tried something different each time but haven't found anything that I love. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"This is my second visit since opening and I was not impressed. I ordered the Grubatouille on a bed of Quinoa ($8.85) I am glad I choose to add the chicken (additional $4.85) or there would of been barely a dinner. The veggies were tasteless and chicken pretty dry. They give you a side of tomato sauce to give the dish some flavor, but my tastebuds did not get excited.   The cost of one meal here for the portion on this specific menu item is pretty steep.   The environment is clean and well spaced/decorated.  With all the choices that are going into downtown Gilbert this would not be a go to for me and the family."}
{"text":"Such a unique place! The food was great and the portions were big. I got the Sweet Lou's BBQ stak, and I personally wasn't a fan of the pork belly. It was delicious otherwise, though, so I'll just ask for that to be left off next time. It wasn't a terrible fry:topping ratio, but we all definitely had some waffle fries leftover. The prices were reasonable, atmosphere was great, and the workers were all very nice. We'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Something unique/different, had a salad that was below average but I could be part of the blame as you build your own."}
{"text":"First off, the service was great!  The employees were really nice, checked on us multiple times.  Food came out fast and hot.  The food wasn't so good though.  I got The Rancher and it was pretty bland. We tried the BBQ too. It was better but not great."}
{"text":"Love this concept! It's like comfort food in a bowl. I'm sure Patton Oswald would not be a fan. The root veggies and sweet potato fries are awesome, so is their chicken."}
{"text":"Give this place a try if you're ever in the area!  The fam went over Memorial Day weekend, and everyone loved everything we ordered!  We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Clean modern feel, great friendly service, good food with huge portion will have me returning here again. I had the Sweet Lou BBQ which is pork belly over waffle fries top with coleslaw. Very tasty. My wife just got dessert the Sweet Stak which is cinnamon covered waffle fries with chili powder and whipped cream. Very delicious. Warning: the portions are enormous, so consider sharing!"}
{"text":"Visiting a friend and was looking for vegan options in the area. Ordered a side of roasted veggies (purple potatoe/parsnip/carrot), quinoa and avocado. I really wanted to like this place because the concept seems cool and the restaurant is super cute and service was great but my food was underwhelming. It lacked flavor and the avocado wasn't fresh but tasted more like the store bought kind that comes in a container typically used for quick guacamole. They have salads but probably not the best option for a vegan."}
{"text":"This place is super good. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and the menu is completely customizable. I got the mac and cheese sandwich and added the chicken, which had an amazing flavor. The owner even comped us a dessert. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place to death but so far I only slightly like it.   The creations are pretty good and you definitely get a lot of food.   I've had the chiliquilles for brunch and it was a lot. Very heavy. Pretty good though as far as flavor and quality.   Then I tried the bbq stack with the pulled beef. The sauce was very sweet and salty. Combined with the fries and veggies I thought everything was just waaay to salty for my taste.   The waffle fries are legit and the root veggies are pretty good too.   Overall not bad. I'll just have to watch my choice next time and find something less salty amd drenched in sweet sauce.  11/20 edit: I now really like this place for brunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, spacious, and fast!  I had the breakfast type grubstak with the over med eggs.  The one thing I recommend is that they start serving poutine. That is what I went there for and was a little disappointed they didn't have it. They could easily pick up some locally made curds and add gravy to their menu.  Amendment to my original review...  Currently eating my Mac Attack that I got last night. I threw it in the oven on broil for about 10 minutes... AH-MAY-ZINGGGG!!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed.... the man was impressed, and the kiddos were impressed. My 11 year old decided to step outside of the kids eat free Tuesday option and grabbed himself The Stak. He said it was one of his top 5 places. He commented on how delicious the egg yolk with the waffle fries and cheese was. Granted, he wasn't a fan of the pork belly but as I said, he is 11 and I believe it was a little too fatty for his taste buds.   I went with the Power Stak Salad and though I personally would have added onion and tomatoes, because I am like thay, it was superb as was. I was particularly impressed with the amount of chicken. Now, when I order a salad I want veggies. So, when I say \"the amount of chicken\" it was not a chicken salad but a kale, quinoa, root veggie salad with pesto chicken and that is how I like it.   The man had the something BBQ Stak and again, on point. I had a bite and was mmmmming over the BBQ sauce, I am a very picky BBQ sauce person and this one was yummy. The cole slaw gave a fresh crisp to the otherwise pretty heavy dish.  The little little went with the grilled cheese. It was perfect portion and she even ate the crust. We are all happy and well fed and will absolutely be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place! I tried the grilled cheese with golden chicken. It was soo good. I cannot wait to come back. I will say, the concept of this place is confusing. Just trust that the place is good. It took me about 5 minutes to order because it is a new concept. That being said, just try it! It's really good. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the chicken and waffle stack to share as I had gastric sleeve surgery last year in May, so my tummy is small. We each ordered a regular coffee to go with our meal.  The waffles were sweet with a over easy fried egg and small crispy bites of delicious chicken lightly breaded. It married together beautifully. Every bite was like a little piece of heaven in my mouth.  The coffee was hot and comforting. The employees were friendly. Service was excellent.  It's the kind of place that you would not expect to have a varied and delicious menu (they offer breakfast, brunch on weekends, lunch and dinner). Guy Fieri visited here back in October 2017. I remember watching the episode clearly. If you are looking for a unique dining experience this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We ordered Notorious R.I.B., the rancher and the Sweet Lou's and each of them we excellent! The short rib was cooked perfectly, the fries were perfect just like chic fil a style fries and had just a perfect balance of fries and toppings. Also talking with the owner, he gave us a free dessert which was the give me s'more. OMG! That was one of the best desserts I've had! At first it looks like it would be really sweet and heavy, but it was absolutely made to devour the entire dish with no guilt. This place is a must!!"}
{"text":"Tasteless; no flavor. My family and I were looking forward to eating here, as it sounded like an interesting place. We were disappointed.   First, it's way too expensive for what it is; a little bit of food on a bed of waffle fries.    More disappointing, the food was very low on the flavor scale. We each had a different dish, so we tried 5 of their menu items. All of them were very bland, like \"old people\" food.   The waffle fries also lacked flavor, which was surprising, really. I mean. All you need to do is use a quality oil and salt to get a decent fry.   I don't see this place lasting past the initial investment money."}
{"text":"Overall I really like the concept of this place. Very unique idea for food. The food was good not mind blowing but it was good and we will go back sometime. The environment is very open and nice. Decent beer selection and various options for you to make your own meal or choose from their already selected options. Looking for something different check this place out."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time from the Grubstak food truck at an event. I ordered the Sweet Lou's BBQ dish, it was huge and we should have shared especially at the price of $11. Good to know you get your money's worth though. The waffles were crisp and the meat was very tasty! Definitely want to try the restaurant out!"}
{"text":"Great staple in Gilbert! Downtown has a lot of bustling restaurants with great ambiance, and this is a nice addition for a quicker meal.   My husband got the local favorite the Chillax with 50/50. He liked the amount of sauce and great flavor. I snuck a bite and really liked the chili addition.   I had the Rancher with 50/50 without sour cream. It was pretty good. For the amount of chicken I had it could have had a little more ranchero sauce. Other than that it had great flavor and I made myself finish it all.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, attentive staff and a delightful owner. Make sure to leave room for dessert! Yum! Very clean."}
{"text":"This place is new. They told me this was their first Saturday open, and they did not fail to impress.  The restaurant is clean and modern in decor.  I was first greeted by a very enthusiastic and friendly worker who - upon finding out this was my first time - she shared that this is the flagship restaurant and was excited to share the menu with me.   I ended up getting the Break the Fast Grubschetta, and it was delicious! They support local businesses like Schreiner's Sausages, and I was happy to hear that not only am I getting good food but also supporting my community. In addition, they used fresh cheddar and sourdough also locally made, adding on top of that the tomatoes, and it really was the perfect way to make this sandwich.  I got my husband the Classic Grubchetta. It's their take on a grilled cheese, and I added the Pork Belly to it. It comes with a creamy and hearty tomato soup that is good for dipping/clinging to the sourdough. Also, we tried the bruschetta tomatoes on it and it added even more layers to the flavor. It was good comfort food for a cool day and a stressful football game.  Also, the peach iced tea is unsweetened and delicious!  The owner and the workers were very nice and attentive. I will definitely go back! Do yourself a favor and take a trip in to support this small business because it'll be more than worth your time!  Thank you, Grubstak!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Had a wonderful experience. The manager and staff were very helpful in ensuring that we all had all of our questions answered so we can make the best decision for dinner. I got the gold rush with regular waffle fries as opposed to half and half regular and sweet potatoes fries. It was really good with that gold sauce and bleu cheese. I would get that again for sure. Also the manager surprised us with the s'mores dessert which was amazing! Each dish has choices of a vase with healthy veggies or salad or fries. This place is pretty cool and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We are new to the Gilbert area. My son found Grubstak on Yelp and suggested it based on photos. It was easy to find and park. It did not disappoint! The food was delicious; the service was excellent. My son had the grilled cheese with tomato soup, I had the avacado toast, and we shared some waffle fries. No pics because we ate it all! We will most definitely return. Great place!"}
{"text":"This is a great concept for a restaurant, if not a little bit confusing. The cashier, Tim, explained the menu to us very well. There is a 'happy hour' but it is only written on a chalk board outside , not on the menu, and it is pretty much a joke. It said $2 off local beers, we were asked if we wanted 16 or 24 oz, we chose 24 oz, but then had it explained after the fact  that the $2 off is only good for 16 oz. This should have been explained to us a LOT better.  The food was excellent! Everything we ordered was fresh, flavorful, hot, and prompt. We were all a little unsure of our decisions once we ordered because it was confusing, but we all agreed that we made great combo choices and everything we ate was delicious!! We will be back and we will be ordering 16oz beers!!  Update: the manager just came out and handed us free dessert for the confusion on the beers and gave us $$ back!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Def a sizable portion and they have draft beer. Rarely a wait and they have many seating options. Great place for a pint or for some grub."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Have tried most of the items on the menu and they never disappoint. The service is great, and they are extremely dog friendly. The BBQ stack and anything off the breakfast menu are a great choice. French toast is some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"My fave in DTG.  The chicken parm with roasted root veggies sold me on this place but I've never ordered a dish I didn't like.  DELICIOUS. Kind of an odd atmosphere but it all works.  Perfect location for the overflow from the ridiculous fake waits on the main street.  Great concept and delicious food."}
{"text":"What a cool place! The food was SO good and we were so impressed by the staff. The owner Colton answered all of our questions in regards to my daughters gluten allergy. He went out of his way to check on some cross-contamination questions I had. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was bomb! I got their Mak Attack, my friend got the Power garden stack and they both exceeded my expectations! Customer service was nice and the atmosphere was cool too! I'm excited to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I don't review much on Yelp but this place is pretty darn good. I would highly recommend splitting an order because the portion is bigger than average. The way you build an order is different but the staff is friendly and more than willing to help newcomers. I ordered \"The Rancher\" which was a great choice that I recommend to anyone. Great food, great staff, and a great casual eating experience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Date night and I don't even know where to begin. This place is an amazing modern eatery in the heart of downtown Gilbert.   I saw the reviews and more importantly the PICTURES on yelp and was more than intrigued when I saw poutine-like dishes.   My boyfriend and I wanted to do a date night at a place out of our normal date-night-cycle and decided to give his place a try. When you walk in the ambiance is very modern and the green accents in combination with the table succulents give it a certain \"freshness.\"   How it works is you pick your base: waffle fries (plain or sweet potato), veggies, or romaine lettuce (or 1/2 and 1/2 of any of them), then your meat, sauce, and cheese. They also have a board with signature staks/salads for those of us that are a bit overwhelmed with all the combination possibilities. Jordan and I tried the Notorious R.I.B and the Grubstak. They were incredible. The horse radish crema on the Notorious was to die for. Both are about $11 and unlike most places you get what you pay for in regards to protein proportions. The combinations were both aesthetically presented and exceptionally tasty.  Jordan has already planned his next combination and date of return, which will be.... tomorrow."}
{"text":"Both my husband and I had the  AZ chicken salad. I had mine with avocado  and it was a scoop of avocado like you get at subway. Overall it was really good, next time I'd ask for dressing on the side."}
{"text":"Ok, its 110 degrees, the snowbirds are gone so its safe to come out and enjoy Old town Gilbert! Grubstak was an enjoyable experience. I had their signature combo with pork, sausage, waffle fries, cheddar cheese and 2 fried eggs. 10.50 My wife had the chicken parm combo with locally grown veggies. About 10.50 Soft Drinks were 2.45  Both dishes were delicious and the staff were very friendly. Nice layout inside and very clean. Cant wait to try sunday brunch.....before the birds return!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! Best crispy chicken ive ever had! Amazing service too! The menu is very easy to use with gluten free options. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"First time and we will definitely be back! Atmosphere is so nice. Place is spotless!! They can customize any order and have beer on tap. Good spot to check out."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch at Grubstak this past weekend.  Four of us each ordered a \"stak\" and we shared.  Tons of food.   Had the pork belly and egg,  the short rib, the black bean chili and the chicken with a buffalo style sauce (only much more sophisticated) served on a stack of waffle fries.  We had the combo of sweet potato and regular.  All were DEEELICIOUS! The staff is friendly and courteous.  We enjoyed a beer with our lunch but sadly didn't have room for the awesome looking desserts.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"What an interesting concept.  I have eaten there twice already and it is one of my favorite places.  Gluten Free, dairy free, vegetarian friendly.  You can ask for one of their signature dishes, or make your own mix.  Friendly staff.  I will definitely go there again, and again, and again.  The place itself is open, too.  When is nice outside there is outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes that this would be one of those great finds based on the reviews, but sadly it was just mediocre.   It did take a bit to understand the menu and the concept; I ordered the Gold Rush and my husband ordered the Rancher. Since it was our first time here, we did a 50/50 base of waffle fries and veggies. We happened to be here during happy hour, so the pints were very well priced (we would come back for just the happy hour next time).  The food was prepared quickly, but to our disappointment, served lukewarm. My husbands was so over run with cheese, he had a hard time  getting a bite without it stringing across the plate (we love cheese - but this was too much!). While it may be our personal preference, having all of the ingredients stacked on top of each other and doused with sauce just made for a mushy single flavor dished. Every bite tasted just like the previous bite; nothing was special about the quality, overall a dull flavor profile and little to no texture since everything turned to mush sitting in the various sauces. Some of our vegetables were undercooked and others overcooked. Needless to say, neither of us finished our meals - which was a true disappointment.  Good news - their patio is dog friendly and appears to get good afternoon shade."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to going here ever since I heard they were opening. I finally was able to stop by this past weekend and was blown away. First things first, the place looks awesome. Second, the beer selection is fantastic for not being a normal place you would get beer. Lastly, but not least, the food is delicious. My wife and I shared the Chillax Stack with 50/50 waffle fries. It was so good. It is like all the comfort food you want, except you don't feel like crap after you eat it. Everything on thew menu looks awesome and I cant wait to try all of the other stacks. The place is a must!"}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing. This is a great Paleo alternative to salad! They've got some amazing sweet potatoes for their base. A bit pricy, but a great quiet stop for the afternoon, with great food, internet, and plugs for my computer so I can work on a paper for school."}
{"text":"This eating experience is unlike any other I've had. The fresh, delicious ingredients pair well with the establishment's unique style of \"stak\"ing one's meal. Combined with a plethora of options ranging from uber-healthy to gotta-run-this-off splurging, you're sure to find something everyone will enjoy. The eclectic atmosphere is both welcoming and entertaining, with tables offering under the table hooks for purses/jackets and charging outlets. The staff is arguably the best thing about this place, making your dining experience one of the best you'll ever have! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious food! A little pricy for the portions but definitely good. Good atmosphere, nestled back so you might not know it's there unless you're looking for it. Will be back to try the other menu items that looked great. We had breakfast this time. French toast- so good . Croissant waffles- delish!"}
{"text":"More people need to come to this place!  It's epically delicious, the service is great and is pretty unique."}
{"text":"Love this place, great dishes.  I love how original each one is, unlike anything out there.  Not only is the food fresh, it's pretty darn good  and very filling too.  This is my second visit and I will return.  Pretty good beer selection too!  Who can complain about $2 Coronas...  In the mood for something yummy but different?  Check it out."}
{"text":"This place is yummy! I had no idea what expect, and boy was it good. My stack had the rooted veggies with mushrooms , Swiss and a gravy . Delicious! My friend got the ranch stack and loved it too. It is a beautiful airy space with high ceilings and great colors . I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. We first tried it a few weeks ago and I love the variety to each and every dish. I'm a vegetarian, my husband is a meat & potato only type guy.... then our 5 yr... that about says enough. But we all were able to find the perfect dish for each of us! Good portion size and great flavor. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at this new addition to the downtown Gilbert restaurant oasis. The restaurant has a nice open floor layout with good style. The staff was friendly and gave a good rundown of the menu. It was a little overwhelming to order- only because I don't do well when all my options seem so good. First world problems. We ordered the Notorious RIB and the Grubstak. Both were SO good. The veggies on the Norotious were so good. The meat was tender and flavorful. And the waffle fries on the Grubstak were yummm. The owner was very friendly and walked around to make sure all guests were pleased. We were very happy with our experience."}
{"text":"It's a casual dining spot.It gives a feel of a  mix between a fast food and a restaurant.the food creativity is awesome and delicious.i would suggest to tone down on the cheese though and infuse some spices."}
{"text":"I really expected great things from this place! Super sad it wasn't delivered. I got the Rancher. Everything was underseasoned. The chicken was boiled-- hard to chew  and seriously lacking any flavor. Salt people... Use the salt!"}
{"text":"Was excited to see that Grubstak was finally open!  Unfortunately, I must admit I was a little let down after visiting.  This is truly a mixed review, because my family enjoyed it, but it was just okay to me.  BIGGEST ISSUES I was confused because for a casual dining place, it seemed they were trying to serve gourmet type food.  The menu is complicated and I believe a menu should be simple.  To have to explain the concept, and then have to describe alot of the food, it's just too much effort.  (I know, first world problems).  I want to see what the food looks like, and they only had three pictures on their side wall.  Be proud of your food and display it for all the world to see.  To me, Grubstak indicates a stack of comfort food that you can grub on.  The food didn't match!  Maybe it's my own hangup and I need to build a bridge and get over it, but I thought Grubstak was going to be a sandwich place where you could stack your sandwich to overflowing!  I had the BBQ dish (forgot what it was called), and it was aight. Waffle fries were bomb, but I think once again, it was the fanciness of the food that threw me off.   GOOD THINGS My family (wife and two daughters) enjoyed the meal.  And anyone who has a house full of females knows that if they all like it, we'll probably be back.  Two of them ordered the Golden Chicken dish (forgot what it was called), and once again, we had to ask what the heck Golden chicken was.  Not sure if it was the owner at the register, but as he described how it was made, I thought, 'Is he trying to audition for Food Network?\".  Once again, with no photo, we had to guess if it was something we wanted to try.   Ambiance is nice, but if I stand in line to order my food, my food shouldn't be this fancy.   I must say the service was definitely great.  Friendly, helpful people.  All good looking (lol) and eager to serve.  And because of that, I think I'll give this place another shot.    Note to owners:  change the name of the restaurant, and if matched the quality of the food (which was really really good), I think my experience would have been better."}
{"text":"First time here, loved it! The people were very nice, the food was great, and they had 2 dollar pints for Father's Day. We were looking for something lower key for Father's Day because we had our 1 year old and he is a pill. We loved the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"How this place is still open is beyond me the food is terrible the customer service is even worse not to mention there are roaches literally everywhere I would suggest not eating here at all costs because this place is disgusting"}
{"text":"Tasty and huge portions! Kelsey was such a wonderful crew member, super helpful and courteous!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the customer service was excellent! The cashier knew her stuff, and helped by suggesting options that ended up being delicious. They made it easy to order dessert without standing in line by letting my run my card again right at the table. The s'mores stack was one of the best desserts I've ever had in my 40 years, seriously. I'd go just for that! I live in Tucson, but I will definitely go back next time I'm in the Gilbert area. I wish they had one down here!!"}
{"text":"I heard about Grubstak on Triple D and decided to try it. I went a few weeks ago with a friend for lunch. It was derrious (better than delicious). Super friendly staff. I had the sweet Lou's bbq with 50/50 (half sweet potato and half regular waffle fries). Waffle fries were crispy! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everyone has that part of them that loves a grilled cheese and Mac and cheese and this place expertly combined the two and added pesto to create an amazing grilled cheese. I love the concept of stacking different foods over a base to make a personalized dish that is mixed together perfectly. The restaurant was well taken care of, very clean, welcoming, and the staff was outstanding. The manager remembered my parents and came over and offered us a free s'mores stack to try because he heard us saying how good it looked! So nice! It was a cool experience and I plan to come back."}
{"text":"Walked by the place a couple times.. now we are sad that we did! It's awesome  the staff is extremely friendly & we were able to eat some amazing food! Thank you Charlie for walking out to greet us & hand us a menu! We wouldn't have come in otherwise. The salad i had was so good! We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Average. 50/50 waffle fries idea is really cool but they need better signature bowls."}
{"text":"My son wanted to try this place so we decided to give them a visit.  It was a very impressive experience. You can choose from a pre-set menu or combine the choices from all the ingredients to make something special for a great meal. I had the Sweet Lou's BBQ Braised Beef and Applewood Smoked Bacon over Roasted Vegetables instead of fries. My son had the BBQ Chicken Salad. Mine was allot of food but his was humongous. We grabbed a couple of beers and enjoyed a wonderful treat. Both dishes were very, very good. The staff was wonderful and the speed in which they had us our food was astounding. It came out piping hot for me and fresh and crisp for my son. They really know how to get you wonderful food, fast with a smile. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I thought the food was excellent.. huge portions and really fresh product. I did think it was overpriced but I'm very glad I tried it! I had the avacado toast sandwich and my husband had the croissant waffles."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I had the chilaquiles which is a new addition to the menu that was absolutely delicious. We also had the Sweet Lous BBQ and some croissant-dough waffles off the brunch menu. I liked it a lot and the family did too. Portions were generous overall. Party of 4 was $47 so it's on the upside of affordable, SPECIAL lunches in our house.   Nice staff, cool-modern space."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure what I expected of this place. The pictures all looked delicious and interesting. My daughter and I ended up trying a few things and were pleasantly surprised. We had the Mac attack grilled cheese (Mac and cheese stuffed grilled cheese), a build your own stack (waffle fries, horseradish crema, and cotija cheese), and a smores stack for dessert. Everything was delicious and came out in a timely manner. Service was fast and friendly, staff even checked on is a couple times even though you order from the counter at this place. Very affordable for the area as well, everything came to about $22. We will be back and hope to try other menu items soon!"}
{"text":"Seth has a winner.. good flavors welcoming staff. I came from California to try it... it is a keeper"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the concept of this restaurant just didn't deliver. We got four different meals and each one had little flavor and just didn't taste like quality food. The chicken seemed like chicken nuggets, there wasn't enough sauce to flavor the plate, and nothing else had inherent flavor so you wholly relied on the little bit of sauce."}
{"text":"Interesting name choice! Normally when I think of \"grub\" it conjures up images of worm-like critters or the feeling of being \"grubby.\" Since the restaurant is sparkling clean and I saw no evidence of grubs on the menu, rest assured that they are referring to the colloquial term \"grub\" for food (Whew!) ;p.  The menu follows the trend of the make-your-own-bowl, but with base foods such as waffle fries, roasted veggies, mac & cheese and romaine lettuce. There are also preset options for bowls, salads and a few grilled cheese sandwich choices available. On Saturdays and Sundays they offer brunch with various bowls such as huevos rancheros and chilaquiles.   We came here for brunch and were greeted warmly by the friendly cashier at the counter. After browsing through the many options I decided on the farmer's scramble. While we waited for our bowls to be made we sat at a cozy little booth and got to take in the atmosphere.   When our orders arrived they looked mouth watering. My bowl was a hefty amount of soft scrambled eggs with roasted veggies, cheese, pesto and bruschetta on top. The flavor combination was well balanced and I especially loved the soft texture of the egg contrasting with the roasted light crispy edges of the vegetables. I also enjoyed their use of unique vegetables such as parsnip and purple potato. My only mild criticism was that the bruschetta was ice cold which made for a jarring juxtaposition with the hot scrambled eggs and roasted vegetables.   My meal was so large I could only finish about half of it so I got a to go box for to eat later. The farmer's scramble was around $8, not bad for all that food!   I'd love to come back again to try more of their combinations."}
{"text":"Grubstak is a great place for a quick dinner I enjoy going here when I go to downtown gilbert. Don't have to wait to get in and eat. Food is A+ and staff is great, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Food was delicious wish they had a wider variety of drinks and some coffee .... besides that everything was great place was very clean and staff was friendly .."}
{"text":"Large portion size and tasty. They have ample indoor seating and the food came out quick. My two year old enjoyed the kids menu. The customer service was great. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! Great place to bring the family even my two-year-old loved it and I service to"}
{"text":"Come and enjoy a fun snack! Tried the \"TRI fecta\" slider: CAPRESE, BBQ, & Sweet Chicken. We'll definitely come back to try more later this week. Excellent customer service.  They honored Happy Hour even tho we walked in a minute after 6pm!  Thanks Grubstax! You should do well here in Gilbert."}
{"text":"HOLY COW!!! This is delicious!! There was something here for the entire family!!!  The food was delicious, staff was fun and friendly and price is fair... the portions are huge and I can't wait to come back and try dessert!!"}
{"text":"I've had a few different items from here and everyone I have enjoyed. The staff has always been welcoming and polite."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The Goldrush is a must have. Their meats and garnishes on top of these fries is a perfect combo!"}
{"text":"Waffle Fries, fries, fries - and toppings! What else could you want!?   Found this place on yelp, of course, and wasn't sure but thought we'd give it a shot. Tucked away in downtown Gilbert just off the main strip is where you'll find this place. Parking in the lot is not easy during peak times cause of all the businesses but there is a parking garage just east with lots of space.   The menu was a little intimidating at first but after looking over it I found quite a few delicious sounding options I wanted to try. For this visit I got the nachos with half and half waffle fries (potatoe and sweet potatoe.)   After having it dropped off to us while we hung out on the patio, it looked and smelt great. Taking a bit into it... even better!! The food was full of flavor and although unusual, a welcomed combination with the fries base and plenty of toppings to enjoy with it.   This place also offers a few options for draft beers and wine. Prices were decent but didn't jump in this time.   Looking forward to coming back again and giving another option a try.  (Two photos are of the Nacho version the third is the Mac Attack - look at em, SO TASTY!)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to old town Gilbert on a Saturday morning and decided to try Grubstak for brunch. When we first walked in the restaurant was clean and spacious and the attendants at the registers were very exciting and answered all of our questions about the menu. I ordered the Grubstak and my boyfriend ordered one of their specials for the day and both were absolutely delicious. We will be back and definitely recommend anyone who is thinking of trying it out to test it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I always seem to get the huevos rancheros. It's hard to try anything different when I've already found something delicious. My husband has gotten a few different things and they were good, but not nearly as good as the huevos. Both the regular and sweet potato fries are equally good, crispy and soft at the same time and they don't get overly soggy as you would expect from all the toppings."}
{"text":"Local business, new concept. We were skeptical at first but turned out to be really cool and so delicious! The customer service was great and so excited to have us. I love that new locally owned business are coming to town!"}
{"text":"Fresh, California- style concept. Urban, clean look. Great service. Great food. BBQ stak was excellent as was dessert. Owner was on hand taking care of colustomers. Located at attractive Downtown Gilbert area, adjacent to parking garage. We'll be back."}
{"text":"It was very good......quality and value is there!!   My only knock is their portions are too large....I wish they offered smaller portions with corresponding price adjustment.  This is why I will probably avoid this place ....no ability to control if a large amount of delicious food is put in front of me."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to get food you love, served with a unique style and twist. My wife and daughter had a late breakfast here. French toast for my daughter, huevos rancheros for me, and BBQ beef for my wife. All 3 dishes were excellent. The waffle fries with the sauce doing into them on a hot skillet is both familiar, and different... and tasty. We'll definitely be back to try more \"staks.\""}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. I cannot remember which grub stack I got but it was delicious. The atmosphere was amazing and so was the staff. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Got this for delivery not too long ago. Food was good overall, although a bit on the heavy/greasy side. Had the mac-n-cheese sandwich which is good when you're starving. Waffle fries are also solid. I'd recommend it when you want something heavy and you're starving."}
{"text":"What a great idea!  Essentially the base to any of the meals is waffle fries, then you choose what you want to \"stack\" on top of them. Cheese, bacon, eggs, chicken, sauces, etc. You can build your own or choose for menu favorites.    Please bring one to the Seattle area!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time and were treated like royalty by Colton Grub. Thank you for the awesome meal and the lovely, complimentary dessert.  Your restaurant is lovely, clean and very comfortable."}
{"text":"The location and ambiance are good for groups - there's potential for it to get loud though. The food was fine. When I tried to look up the menu ahead of time all I could find was press releases talking about \"healthy\" options and that is complete disengenuous. The dishes are primary large bowls of French fries with cheese and other toppings. And as the dishes cool down they get heavy and greasy. I'd rather the price and portions drop."}
{"text":"Really overpriced for what you get. Basically loaded fries with unique toppings, but ok execution. We got the Grubstak and Sweet Lou's BBQ stack, both sound good on paper but flavors were nothing to brag about. Th gravy was too thin on the Grubstack and cheese was not melty enough. The BBQ pork and coleslaw was meh. If you want to create your own stak be prepared to fork out $12 if you want to pick one your choice of base, grub, cheese and sauce."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?? This place is amazing.  I like total crap food and my fiance is all about the healthy food.  We both had many options and each enjoyed our food.  I had the Grubstak signature dish with half and half.  If I did it again I'd do just the regular waffle fries and pass on the sweet potato version.  The lady had some avacado toast thing and devoured it.  We will be back here.  Great staff, clean facility, and fast."}
{"text":"Yum! And yum!!!! Take advantage of no lines before the word gets out. Super friendly service and good food. I like my food scalding hot so it could have been a bit hotter, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a fun place to eat?! They have a wide range of options for topping fries or a salad. We opted for the BBQ and chicken rancher stack. Big portions, fast service, tasty food.   I'd recommend this place to folks looking for a quick meal in downtown Gilbert.  They have an outdoor patio that looked nice. Tables for 2 or large parties."}
{"text":"It is so refreshing to see this nice neighborhood restaurant. I have been here a couple times and have really enjoyed their creative food The food is consistently good and my neighbors who I  met at the restaurant also like it a lot. Looking forward to making it a regular stop. I hope they open one in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great place to take the family. Save room for desert!  .................................."}
{"text":"This was such a fun place to go and eat it! It's not really like anything you've tried before! It was super creative and delicious! I got the grubatouille! I loved the grilled veggies in it. I can't wait to go back and try another stak. The avacado toast salad looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to try it. Upon entering the cashier asked if it was our first visit, we said yes, and she explained the ordering process then recommended a few items. I had the veggie base rancher and it was amazing! They were generous with the chicken and it was packed with flavor! The dining area is spacious and it was very clean. Adding this place to my favorites and looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Great food,  lots of variety. A little pricey but portions are large.  Will definitely be returning on a regular basis"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with husband and friends prior to seeing a play at the Hale Theater. No wait like the other restaurants on Gilbert. Staff was friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. We we're checked on several times to see if everything was ok. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had the Sweet Lou's BBQ And I added Mac n cheese to that WOW! The sauce for the Mac n cheese is so good! Don't hesitate to order a stak and see what you've been missing out on!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place, and the food is delicious. The fries are great, they also have gluten free, dairy free, and vegan options. Get the base of roasted veggies and the french fries on top it was delicious. The one downside is this place seems a bit expensive for casual fare. The service was good and the place looked clean, so definitely a great place to check out."}
{"text":"Met here for a huge group dinner. They were so accommodating for our group of 25. I had no idea what to expect before I went and found the menu to be unique: different kinds of potatoes (fries and tots etc) with toppings of all kinds. Among our group we ordered all kinds of combinations and everything was incredibly yummy. The kind of meal where you all want to trade bites :) would definitely go again but be warned the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"A really fun casual concept with excellent, friendly service! Perfect for a \"treat\" day. Choose your starch (fries of root veggies) or salad and top with some tasty goodness. Hubby ordered \"The Grubstack\" which boasted a healthy (but not so healthy :)) amount of toppings and lots of flavor, I tried the \"Gold Rush\" with juicy, tender chicken and a tangy-sweet mustard sauce. Mac 'n Cheese was creamy and the side portion was enough to serve two with leftovers (keep in mind we also tried two entrees). They serve some adult beverages too - the beer was perfectly poured and fresh. Looking forward to trying more options when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. I took my husband here  who isn't crazy about waffle fries and even loved it. The food is fresh, hot, and tastes great. The staff was super friendly. We will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious, creative food. Space is clean and comfortable and not overly loud. Helpful, friendly service."}
{"text":"Got a stack with Golden Chicken which basically means it has a buffalo type sauce. The flavor was good but the chicken is so weird. It came in 3 little meat ball type shapes. It wasn't ground chicken, but it was almost like it had been put through a food processor first. Just a strange texture and look. Kind of turned me off. I may go back and try another protein."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is really awesome and it can be as healthy as you make it.  They offer gluten free and dairy free options, with protein, veggies, and yummy sauce. The owner (Colton), service, and ambience are top notch.  Plus I love their cold brew coffee on tap and the green iced tea."}
{"text":"My first thought when I walked in was how open, welcoming, and trendy the place is. The customer service was excellent they were very helpful and kind. They have multiple TVs around the restaurant if you want to eat and watch a game. The concept for the food is nothing like what I've eaten before and it was so good!!!! I got the Mac Attack which is like a grilled cheese, Mac n cheese with pesto like a bruschetta. You can have beer or wine with your meal which makes a good date spot. The portions are also perfect so you leave comfortably full. I give this place a two thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Comfort food done in a culinary, unique way. Might be our new favorite place. Get the s'mores stack!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town.  I love the idea behind this restaurant. Great atmosphere. The very friendly waitstaff at the counter was patient and explained the concept and the menu to us.  The food was fast and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. We came on a Tuesday evening when it was fairly slow. Everything was clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful when ordering with it being our first time. We ordered the Chillquiles and the Louie BBQ and enjoyed both of them. I recommend this place for a fun new tasty dish. We will be back."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, but confusing to figure out what goes well together. They have a few things put together, but the staff didn't seem to know how to recommend their product. When I asked what sauce I should add, she said any of them. And when my wife said there were too many choices, the cashier should have offered to recommend something.  I would suggest they spend time every day trying new things and letting their people sample them so when someone asks what's good, they can actually tell them.  That aside the food was ok, but then again, that could be cause I put the wrong stuff together. If they don't understand their product, neither will their customers and they will go someplace else."}
{"text":"I got the Goldrush and my fiancé got the Mack attack! Both were delicious! We finished off with the Sweet as Honey for dessert. They use high quality ingredients and everything was amazing! We will definitely be going back often!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, don't get the \"ranchero\" the chicken on top tasted like it was infused with the essence of dirty sweat socks, another tip, don't get the half veggies, they taste awful and they make your waffle fries soggy."}
{"text":"Yummo! Brought the A-team with me for lunch and food did not disappoint! Very friendly staff and very helpful with the menu - whether you want to build your own stak or order the specialties; we did the latter. All of us had waffle fries as our base, but my daughter and I did the half sweet potato and half regular fries. Sooo good! I love that they have Coke products and unsweetened iced tea. Had to take half of our food home & the hubs ate the leftovers! He too loved it and wants to go with is for next time! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. So far I've tried it 4 times and different plates each time and from the soggy fries due to them letting my meal sit around or the sitting in a pool of old grease I just can't come around to recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here during happy hour! \"Sliders\" were $2 and it was basically a tiny fries sandwich, but it was delicious and what you'd expect for $2! Would definitely come here again to try the many different options they have available! We also got 50/50 fries (half regular and half sweet potato) and both were yummy!!"}
{"text":"This new place is terrific!  Super fresh food, great flavors, modern atmosphere... we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Since it's a new concept I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised! The food is REALLY good and a nice change from the usual. The great thing was my husband was able to splurge and I kept it nice and healthy. Even our friend who owns a number of restaurants and is a legit food guy continues to go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and had a full lunch for leftovers :) Definitely going to save room for dessert next time! I had a 'build your own' and the braised beef rib was awesome. Nice for a casual dinner and you don't have to wait 3 hours to sit down like everywhere else in Gilbert"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and creative! Both desserts were amazing! Will be back very soon:)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The staff is super friendly. Really chill vibe. Food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food. Food came out fast! Service was great for first time visit. They helped us decide what and how to order as well as the most popular dishes. Happy hour is a joke. Happy hour is only on a couple of items and not worth the discount. Don't come here for beers and apps after work. Come here for lunch, and fast dinners for family, everyone can order what they want."}
{"text":"The food is good however, their SILVERWARE is DISGUSTING. It has food on it. Obviously, their kitchen dishwasher isn't CLEANING their dishes PROPERLY."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Friendly staff!  My favorite is the kale salad with the avocado toast.  tomato soup and grilled cheese was great too! Waffle fries are good too!  I tried the veggies on top of the waffle fries once and it made the fries soggy.  I wouldn't have that combo again."}
{"text":"First I want to share for anyone Gluten Free they have CRISPY chicken parmesan!  Cannot remember the last time I ate crispy chicken. It was very good. I had it over fries, but depending on tolerance level it can be over veggies.   Husband enjoyed his Sweet Lou's BBQ with bacon.  The place is not on Gilbert so I did not notice it before. Thankfully my YELP search led us here.   Check them out!"}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical of this place. Seemed like just another fad restaurant. I was waaay wrong!   The food was really good! I substituted coleslaw for Mac and cheese in my meal which was a great suggestion made by the guy behind the counter and I would suggest getting sweet potato fries over regular fries. The staff was super friendly and helpful (note: I did go on a weeknight). Plenty of food to share with another person. I would recommend if you do reheat leftovers to put them in the oven at 350 for like 10 minutes so they taste as good as the day you bought it.  It's a bit pricey but worth the cost so plan on spending like 20-25 for 2 people unless you are sharing a meal. This place is a great addition to downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Finally! I've finally been motivated into writing a positive review! We were on our way to another restaurant when we noticed Grubstak. Having never heard of it we decided to be adventurous and give it a try. Upon entering we were greeted by a very friendly staff who took their time to explain the food and ordering process. We each chose a meal that sounded good and proceeded to find a seat. All the open tables were clean and we also noticed the entire seating area was spotless and laid out in very comfortable order. The food arrived quickly and it was hot and fresh. All 3 of us enjoyed our meal. My 6 year old daughter ate all of hers and shared both moms and dads too. The food was excellent, the customer service was outstanding and the atmosphere extremely pleasant. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun and unique concept! Both regular and sweet potato waffle fries with every kid of topping you could ask for! Great idea combinations and create your own. This is such a fun place for all taste buds and preferences. Not to mention allergy and intolerance friendly!  The employees were incredibly kind and helpful and contributed to the inviting and fun atmosphere.  The restaurant was spacious and could easily accommodate groups! I loved that they had a table with hooks for your bags and charging outlets! Great way to get your customers to stick around!  This is a wonderful addition to downtown Gilbert and I hope they'll stick around!"}
{"text":"Great food, and really fast free wi-fi.  I like to come here at lunch to get some work done.  The porch is quite and comfortable.  Pull out your laptop and enjoy the day!"}
{"text":"When Grubstak first opened, I LOVED it! But the last two visits haven't been very good.  The food I've ordered has been mediocre, and the kids meals were completely inedible. I also encountered a snarky employee, so overall everything seems to have just gone downhill. Hopefully they can get things back to the way they were when they first opened, but I probably won't be coming back again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Like others before me, I was nervous the glamour would outweigh the flavor, but this novel restaurant is worth the praise it receives. I chose the Sweet Lou's BBQ signature stak with 50/50 sweet potato and regular fries and replaced the coleslaw with mac n cheese (a must), and couldn't be more satisfied with the finished product. I highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for something a little different for a meal."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today because a friend of mine sent an article about all the Guy Fieri DDD restaurants in Phoenix.  I've been to about eight DDD recommended places in AZ and Calif and all of them were great.  Grubstack was fabulous!  I had the Signature Grubstak and my friends each had the grilled cheese mac and cheese sandwich.  Waffle fries and waffle sweet potato fries were the bomb.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The people who give a one star rating are either paid by the competition or just plain morons. This is a great place with lots of variety and flavor combinations. If it's not your favorite place to go then fine, but be reasonable and give it a fair rating... it will never be a one star establishment.   Please go and enjoy for yourself. You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Shawn has great hospitality. Food is delicious and portions are worthy of the price! Tuesday kids eat free!"}
{"text":"We came here because the wait was too long elsewhere and had pretty low expectations considering how quiet the place was on a Saturday night in downtown Gilbert. We were very pleasantly surprised! All three of our kids plowed through their meals (Mac and cheese, crispy chicken and pizza) and my husband and I both loved our meals. I got the Rancher on half fries/half roasted veggies. My husband got the Grubstak. We would order both again. Everything was quick, affordable and really delicious and the restaurant was clean and comfortable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in downtown Gilbert. I struggle to find restaurants that can accommodate my food allergies while appealing to my kiddos. The food is delicious! Vegan and gluten free diets are accommodated without sacrificing flavor. Neat concept and food that will satisfy the whole family."}
{"text":"I always have great service here! The food is unique and delicious. I recommend the ratatoulli with the regular fries!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to go in downtown Gilbert with good food and beer, and don't want to deal with lines even on the weekend, then Grubstak is a great place to go. Comfort fusion food with a friendly staff and attractive ambience, it's a great value and worth a stop. Give it a try, and prove me wrong."}
{"text":"I was looking for something new for dinner last night and found Grubstak on Yelp; wow, did I luck out!  If you enjoy guiltless, yet flavorful, food...this place is for you!  Of course, they have the not so healthy options for cheat days too such as grubschetta, mac and cheese, ribs, pork belly and waffle fries. They also offer beer and wine which is always appreciated. ;)  I ordered the \"Power\" which included a layer of quinoa, fresh perfectly roasted root vegetables, with peppery arugula and yummy pesto.  I added shredded chicken for extra protein. So darn good!  The portions are huge, so plenty for sharing or leftovers.  As far as the ambiance, this place is modern, clean and beautiful.  The staff is very friendly and you can easily place your order online, which is what I did for take out. I highly recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Ate lunch with business partners today.  R.i.B. On veggies was on point.  The creamy horseradish sauce and grilled veggies were great and I left feeling great I stead of bloated.  You can definitely tell the beef is grass fes"}
{"text":"Deliciousness, the perfect new age food for this great growing city!   Great new concept and the service is on point!"}
{"text":"Great new local restaurant. Lots of gluten free options. All steaks get served over waffle fries, waffle sweet potatoes or root vegetables. So very yummy. Gluten free. Celiac friendly. Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Had the Sweet Lou's BBQ.  A few observations...  - Meat component was good - Cole slaw was good, but there wasn't enough of it - BBQ sauce was good, but a little sweeter than I like - Waffle fries.  Not a fan (although in fairness, I'm not a fan anywhere).  Anything that the meat/bbq sauce sat on made the waffle fries soggy.    Overall good and would be willing to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Very friendly service and food tasted great. The space is very open and inviting. The S'more Stak is a must!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Rhode Island, and my two friends and I needed breakfast! Grubstak was down the road from where we were staying and we figured mimosas would be the perfect start to our Saturday! When you walk in you go to the register and the menu is laid out simple! I decided to go with the avocado toast sandwich. The avocado was fresh and the bread was super crunchy and delicious! For a beverage i decided to have a few mimosas and boy were they delicious. Our waitress Charlie was super kind and made great conversation with us! I can't wait until I fly back out because i most definitely will be visiting this place again! One of my new favorite spots when I'm in Arizona! Keep it up Grubstak!"}
{"text":"Very cool concept. Comfort food at its best. The employees were super awesome explaining the menu and giving suggestions. Definitely didn't leave hungry! You could tell everything was fresh. Loved that they only serve local beer- AZ pride!"}
{"text":"The employees are great, food has always been perfect. My daughter loves this place. However, I usually find myself heading to another place to eat because their vegetarian options are super limited. Hoping they expand their menu or make vegetarian subs for the meat dishes."}
