{"text":"Just finished my 13 wings and fries and WOW, that was delicious. I had the Game Changer and Hotter Than Hot, and I loved both! The people working there were so friendly and fun to talk to! Julie at the counter helped us choose, as we had never been there. The Game Changer was not something I would have chosen by myself, but now I'm never not ordering them when I go there (which will be often)! New favorite wing place."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a big fan of wings, but a friend suggested we order Big Shot Bob's for our remote fantasy football draft. I'm now a big fan of Big Shot Bob's wings.  I just have a hard time deciding which variety to order - I would recommend any of the following: Black Frank White, Cool Runnings, Frankie Valli, Superfly TNT, and the Talk of Beaver Falls."}
{"text":"Lucky to have found this place. Our family loves the wings. Too many varieties to mention (or try)."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of mark madden and ge talks about bobs on his show, and ohh was he right, amazing wings but better staff THEY MADE UP A FLAVOR FOR ME!!!!!! NOW THAT IS SERVICES. WELL DONE."}
{"text":"Nothing but average. Wings were small and flavor was just ok. I can get better wings at most local bars. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"One star seems a little harsh but Yelp describes the 2 stars as meh and I would say it was bad. Everyone agreed that the fries were too salty to stomach, and we ate as many as we could before tossing them. I don't know what was up with the wings, but they were misshapen for some reason and dry. I had a pretty good experience with them the first time I ordered from them but after this I'll avoid it probably. I don't feel too bad writing a negative review like i normally would because for some reason people have attached the title of Best Wings in Pittsburgh to BSB's and probably don't care about what old Jerry S. has to say about it.

I've been trying to branch out and try a lot of wings in the area, and if you want my top 3, you can't go wrong with

1. Mike and Tony's (I've only had the Bridgeville location)
2. Wiggy's
3. 51 Wings and Things

These boys make the best wings."}
{"text":"My friends and I were jonesin' for some wings, and we decided to give this place a try. Let me tell you, we were NOT disappointed. The building was small - there were only 4 bar stools inside to eat, and a table outside so I would suggest getting take out. I got two flavors - the Most Interesting Flavor in the World (by employee recommendation) and Mr. Northside. The most interesting flavor was definitely my favorite - it was a dry rub, but it was a good blend of seasoning. Mr. Northside was a blend of honey mustard and BBQ sauces. I liked this one too, and would probably get it again (after trying a few more). The woman who took our order was SO HELPFUL, and even told us a little bit about how BSB got started. The prices were decent too, and the salads and hoagies I caught a glimpse of looked like they would be legit choices too. I will 100% be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the burgers were decent and the wings were good (we got Uncle Rico's sauce) but their customer service is really in your face. My husband and I were looking at the menu deciding what we'd like and guy at the counter kept asking like how many wings and how many burgers we wanted before we'd really decided (because the food \"takes a while to cook\") and said we could decide on a flavor once they were cooking except we weren't even really sure what we wanted to order yet. I actually would've preferred a hoagie but I'd already said the word \"burger\" so they started cooking one and I would've felt bad about changing my mind (even though I hadn't even ordered yet!).

When my husband went back to pick up the food, the guy from the back apologized randomly and when my husband said \"sorry for what?\" The guy said \"because you're never going to want a burger anywhere else.\" Like it was just really arrogant and weird and off-putting.

It was the first time I'd been back in there in like a year because the last time I was there I waited for my food and they gave the 6 wings they had dropped for me to a pickup order and I waited like 45 min for my food. (They knocked money off my total at the time and I didn't hold a grudge, just really hadn't had a chance to go back.) Their customer service just seems to leave me with a bad taste any time I go in there."}
{"text":"Ordered for my daughter and she like them. Delivery had her go down to the car. When bank statement came, it was $4 more than I anticipated. My kiddo signed and did not grab receipt but it seems that the driver may had padded the tip."}
{"text":"I have ordered from the before and theyve been good. But...
We got them last night and they were to die for. Seriously. Huge wings, great sauce, all around great. Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"The order of wings I received were WAY over cooked. Crunchy, burnt over priced wings that I could barely chew. Very disappointing considering they are the \"house of wings\"... will not be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time, WOW, wings were AMAZING, had mild, butter garlic parm, & The Most Interesting Flavor In The World, all were great, but TMIFITW, definitely lived up to it's name, will order ftom here again"}
{"text":"After reading reviews on yelp about this joint I decided to try the wings with the Game Changer flavor. They were the best wings I've ever had!! Big, juicy, crunchy and the sauce was a mix of dry rub, park cheese and blue cheese dressing I think, and it was great. Added a an Italian hoagie that was about as get as you can get anywhere around the area. Will be trying more of the 150 different flavors of wings for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order from BSB's several times a month.  Prior to this location, we would drive nearly an hour to their location in Coraopolis just to get these wings! 

I always hated eating wings because anywhere in Pittsburgh I'd seem to go the wings would be chewy and of poor quality. The quality of the wings that are used by BSB's changed my opinion on wings entirely. They're crisp and juicy and absolutely incredible. The quality alone was enough to keep me coming back. Now let me talk about the sauces... I want to know who came up with these flavors and how.  They are out of this world and must be developed by a mad genius.  They have enough variety of sauces to please any palate! This place never seems to disappoint. So happy there's a wing place close by.  On top of it all, I believe i just heard they were ranked best wings in PA by Esquire Magazine! Well deserved if I do say so myself."}
{"text":"The wings were good , we tried 4 different kinds, we do prefer the dry ones, the steak hoagie was ok. Don t like the atmosphere when we pick them up."}
{"text":"I get steak salads about twice a week. Julie has an awesome personality and she makes great salads."}
{"text":"Probably the best wings in Pittsburgh.

The only problem is having to order via phone. It is 2018, get an online order available. Seriously, what companies still do this?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got Bobs for the first time tonight. He got 13 of the game changer and I got a grilled chicken salad. He is very picky about his wings and proclaimed that these were the best he has had in a long time. Very flavorful and good sized. He is usually a big ranch user,  he did not even use his ranch for these wings,  unneeded. The salad was fresh and well made. We are both very pleased and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious wings! The flavors are incredible. We tried several flavors and every one of them was delicious. We will absolutely be ordering here again! The wings are cooked correctly. Nice and crispy on the outside, never gummy or weird like some places."}
{"text":"Holy shit. Heaven on earth for people that appreciate sauces as much as I do. If you feeling like licking your fingers and making your belly smile this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great wings.  I ordered takeout and got the dry cajun, wet bbq, steel city, hot garlic parm, and the big easy.  All of the flavors were great and I would get them all again.  My favorites were the hot garlic parm and the big easy.  Not only were the sauces great, but the wings were cooked perfectly.  The workers were also very friendly.

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the ranch.  With wings this good, I expected great ranch, and it was average.  Tasted bottled rather than homemade."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them 3 stars because there's not yet a BSB's in Homestead, but I couldn't justify that.

Quite frankly, the reviews are right and the 4/5 star rankings are spot on. The wings are BIG -constantly cooked correctly, always crispy, never soggy. There are over 40+ sauces to choose from, so im hard-pressed to think anyone can find one they don't like.

Pro Tip - Get the chicken philly with your favorite wing sauce. You wont be disappointed.

BSB's is quickly becoming a Pittsburgh staple, so if you haven't tried it already, I would certainly recommend you doing so !"}
{"text":"Boy o Boy where do I start!? So last night my and my girlfriend were thinking about ordering out on a lazy Sunday. However, me and her have different cravings from time to time. I was in the mood for some wings. A mood that I'm rarely in but I wanted some good wings. We started looking around and came across Big Shots! 

The first good thing about the decision I made to get wings here was the service. Being that it was my first time ordering out here, I was not familiar with all the different wing flavors they had. There had to be close to 50 different sauces and rubs that you could pick from. The lady I spoke to helped me not only complete my order but she provided great service when I also wanted to order a side of fries. Which she recommended I get the wings over top so the sauces would cover the fries as well. With so many dressings for the wings it was nice to have someone ensure you were getting the works! 

Being that were so many flavors, I finally went with the Ace Boogie! A combination of dry rub with garlic and ranch topped with there black magic seasoning! So good. Seriously the best wings I've had in a long long time. Big juicy wings and drumsticks! If you are looking for great wings with a reasonable price, Big shot Bobs is the place for you! Truly the house of wings! I was stuffed full after eating about 8 out of 13. A lot of good for a small price and dozens of flavors to pick from. I see myself coming back very soon. No complaints. If you are reading this review, stop and find your local Big Shot Bobs, and place an order for wings! You'll be thanking me you did!"}
{"text":"I love this place they always get my order right and I never have a problem with them being rude their always nice and happy to see you. Btw eye of the tiger is where it's at"}
{"text":"Best wings in the city. I certainly underestimated the place driving by but now I'd never get take out wings from any other location. Eye of the tiger is my favorite flavor, and the all-in dry."}
{"text":"I went here to grab some take out on a Friday night. The place is small, definitely not conducive for eating in - but that's okay because the wings are great! The woman taking orders was very informative, giving my friends and I some brief history of Big Shot Bob's and telling us about their products. Everything is made fresh! Their salads are even something to write home about! She even let us sample a new sauce that they were piloting. There were 2 gentleman working in the kitchen and they were able to have our 3 dozen wings ready within 20 minutes. The wings were crispy unlike some places I've eaten at. My favorite flavor I ate came from an employee recommendation - Game changer .. and it truly was a game changer. A mixture of a dry / wet rub with Parmesan cheese - PERFECTION. If you are looking for a wing spot to get take out, check out this location. They just opened a location in South side that is a more restaurant type setting. Make sure you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Ordered from the beechview location. They only do takeout and delivery as they offer no seating in the very small operation. There were two people working in the whole place. You would think because of this low overhead they would offer decent prices however with everyone in the area offering wing specials, these come in on the priciest side. They were friendly and helpful over the phone and the order was ready as I arrived. Appropriately packaged for a take out only business. The sauce list was daunting but chose some of the more popular ones... here lays the issue at hand.. 1 sauce per order and the amount per order.. either 6, 13, or 50... well gee idk about you but I sure would like something between 13 and 50... wings were above average but not enough to warrant the price point and lack of ordering options"}
{"text":"Another BSB's popped up.  This location use to be Feeney's Weenies, sorry to see it go.

We ordered and picked up over the weekend since we knew we would be driving by.  We tried 3 of the 150 types of wings...Primetime that are sweet and hot with a golden BBQ, the ever so popular Talk of Beaver Falls that are hot and tangy with large pieces of black pepper and the Medium.  All were good.  The wings are crisp with the sauce covering and sloppy to eat. 

The menu included Burgers & Sandwiches, Hoagies & Gyros, and Salads and a few Starters for those not interested in wings.

This is really a take out location.  No seats.  There is a small skinny counter at the window if you want to eat in.

The service was good and very friendly.  The server gave one person a few tastes a couple of sauces after he asked them what type of sauce they liked along with a few other questions."}
{"text":"A friend spoke highly of BSB's so we ordered some delivery to Brookline. Staff was extremely friendly and courteous over the phone and at the door.  Food arrived within the hour, as promised.  13 Black Frank White wings and bacon cheese fries.  Fries were delicious.  Wings were very meaty and the sauce was perfect! No complaints from us and we will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here multiple times & I tend to get the same wings even though they have a lot to pick from. I get the \"Black Frank White\" wings & my husband gets the \"Mild\" with an order of large fries.
Their wings are generally really good, but this time my husband & I both got sick . On top of that, the guy who took our order over the phone was very rude! Let me say, this is not the first time they have been rude... the very first time we ordered from here the delivery guy was very rude! 
I can't stand when people have bad customer service skills!! I'd rather order from somewhere else or try a different location especially after getting sick from their food.
Overall, service sucks! Food is not worth eating if dealing with bad service especially if your not there to witness them making your food."}
