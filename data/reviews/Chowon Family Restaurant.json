{"text":"First time at an authentic korean family restaurant and I was blown away by the food. The spicy fried chicken was amazing  and so was the pork bone soup. Although our table questioned the lack of potatoes (even when it said potato pork bone soup in Chinese on the wall menu) the waitress gave some weird explanation in English that no one understood. Forgot the names of the other items I tried but it was all good none the less. Must come back here to try their Bibimbap!"}
{"text":"I ordered their bibimbap for take out once. I was really disappointed with it. It was barely warm, and the overall amount I got wasn't worth the price (and very little beef was added). I can't speak for the sit-in dining experience, but I wouldn't go back for take out. I'm not Korean, but I had a feeling that maybe if you're Korean, you'd be treated better."}
{"text":"It's a slightly small place and had to wait a couple minutes for a table to free up at 6:30pm on a sunday but that was okay. Ordered the Jajang Myun, pork and squid in hot sauce and bibimbap. Everything tastes pretty great especially the pork and squid thing and the portions are pretty massive."}
{"text":"Came here on a frosty evening craving for something hot and stewy and this restaurant definitely hit the spot! It was fairly busy on a Monday night but we got a table right away.   We ordered the spicy chicken and potato hotpot, which came with two bowls of white rice. All the veggies were raw and the chicken was half-cooked so it took awhile for everything in the hotpot to to be fully cooked, but it was worth the wait! The chicken was flavourful and tender, and the spiciness level was just right. The hotpot came with a generous serving of potatoes, zucchini, onions, tomatoes and mushrooms - yum!"}
{"text":"I went there with a couple of friends and had a pretty good meal.  Based on other the yelp posts, we got the kamponggi which was delish! We ordered the seafood version of this, not realizing that the sauce was the same, but it was still good! I think I might prefer the seafood one better. I also tried soondubu (tofu soup) for the first time and thought it was yummy but my friends said it usually comes with an egg, which it didn't here. Perhaps you have to ask for one?   All in all, I enjoyed the food there but considering the number of restaurants in that area I'll probably try out a few others before returning."}
{"text":"No potato in my gamjatang, and the soup was a little bland. Liked the radish side dish and the good ambience. Overall food was decent for the price."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good (above average) and the price is reasonably.   However, the young femele waitress's attitude was RUDE! We have 5 people including 3 elder), but since sizes of dished are large, we ordered 4-people menu set. She first recommended if we need to order more (well understandable). But later because the food is to salty we order 1 more rice, then she laughed a bit and said \"I told you it is not enough\". ...?!?!?!.....  Also, in the middle of our dinner, she came and cleaned up some empty dishes. She EVEN asked us to put the dished in the way she needed (small dishes on top of the large one, plastic ones was separated with china dishes), making us feel that we are HER WAITRESS!! So rude!!!!!  I would still recommend the restaurant but the waitress does damage the image of the store."}
{"text":"A bit off the main path but don't be deceived - great food, good friendly service, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! Not only did they let a family bud us in line because they were regulars but had to wait forever for service. The table next to us had to ask for the menu a million times before they got it and they were there before us. Not to mention, the servers were RUDE like no other (maybe cause we only spoke English). Omg, NEVER going back. Forget the food! It was just too infuriating."}
{"text":"Service was below average.  Food was awesome. Especially the sweet & spicy Chicken.  They have got lots of booths so that a group of friends can be seated in a private booth.   Indeed, service was not impressive.  most people here mentioned there was a rude young waitress.   She served us. She was really rude !!  We accidentally moved the gas stove grilling, when she passed by our booth, she dared to yelled at us: \"I told you not to move the stove !!\"    Not satisfied with her attitude at all.  Other older waitresses were very polite, though."}
{"text":"Chowon is definitely a favorite eatery amongst Koreans. My dad loves this place, my friends love this place and I love it specifically for their Mandoogook, piping hot, with lots of mandoo and slightly on the salty side, just the way I like it. Last time I came here, I barely touched my food because I was so darn nervous. Why is it that I completely lose my appetite whenever I'm around a guy I'm into? The waitress asked me if my food was okay when she saw that I hadn't touched my food yet (not with a look of annoyance but more with a look of genuine concern that only Korean ahjumas seem to be able to pull off...). That said, the service was great, the food was great, the place is clean. Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I always come for table BBQ, great food, good service. Other items, pork bone soup, soon tofu soup, and pork chop rice are very nice."}
{"text":"By far - the worst Korean restaurant in the Yonge/Finch area.  I ordered the LA Kalbi and mool naeng-myung (cold noodles) which should be in high demand around this time and since today was over 30 degrees Celsius.  The cold noodles came out but the \"soup\" was almost completely frozen. I'm used to seeing a couple of ice cubes or the soup would be somewhat slushy.  You can tell that they completely froze it and forgot to take it out and since they cook in bulk, they had to literally hammer away at it to break it up.  My LA Kalbi was given to another customer...i had to wait 15 minutes before I asked the lady to see where it was.  She offered to have another one cooked up.  There were about 3 other tables occupied on this Sunday, so it's not like it was busy for them to forget. I've lived in this area for 20 plus years and this restaurant has changed owners at least 3 times, and it's obvious to see why. Terrible customer service - they don't check on you at all.  Suffice to say that I will never be coming back here again.  Price was expensive too: $21.99."}
{"text":"A fun place to get a hot plate or BBQ. Been a few times, getting something different each time and always really enjoyed my meal. Solid proportions and plenty of choices - would recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the cold spicy noodles that came with a huge yellow mustard squirter containing the spiciest mustard I've ever tried. I didn't use any of it because the dish was covered in red spicy sauce. Interestingly, there was a slice of snow pear hidden among the cucumber, boiled egg and other veggies that I couldn't identify. The noodles also arrived with a pair of scissors to cut up the noodles.  The tofu dish among the little appetizers was the freshest I've ever had at a restaurant.  We sat in a spacious wooden booth complete with a doorbell to call the server (I hear this is standard in Korea). The place was fluorescent lit with a lot of smoky smells coming from the other tables having BBQ at their tables. Locals are die-hard about coming back for more.  The price was right and definitely good value. The food is very authentic from what I can tell. TMI point: the food will give you mega gas for days."}
{"text":"Spicy Korean food is my definition of comfort food.   Chowon really hit the spot - I left with a full belly of warm spicy seafood noodle soup!   The hand made noodle had great texture, however, the soup was so hot that it became overcooked by the time I ate half the bowl. There was an abundance of seafood which includes squid, shrimp, clams, white fish...etc.   The pork bone soup had delicious base flavour, but wasn't spicy enough in my opinion. There were also no potatoes, which I loved since I always pick them out.   Everything on the menu was decently priced (our bill was under $20 for two people), and the service was attentive enough. I wish we had a ringer in the booth we were sitting in because it was hard to flag down our server to get the bill.   Parking is available right out front, but it's a one-way parking lot, so don't make the same mistake I made by driving in the opposite way.."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite korean restaurant in this area. What I come here for is the pork bone soup or gamjetang. This place probably has one of the best tasting pork bone soup I had to date (and I been to quite a few korean restaurant).  This place recently gotten a refresh and the crappy interior of the restaurant is gone and replaced by new modern looking tables, plates and signs.   Come try this place out!  Ps there are also KBBQ at this place but I have never tried"}
{"text":"Above average Korean restaurant.  Food is \"okay\". Portions are generous. The menu is big and has most of your standard items... my favorite was their sweet and spicy fried chicken. The texture of the jampong noodles were good but the soup lacked flavor although it was bright red.  None of the banchan stood out to me.  Service gets everything done but is slow because all seating is a small booth so it is hard to see wait staph. The whole place needs a makeover.  Overall 2.5/5"}
{"text":"The waiters barely spoke English and the specials were posted only in Korean. I ain't complaining though -- that means AUTHENTICITY to me. The one time I had gone before I was satisfied in my belly but my eyes were still wandering...everyyyone else was in the know & ordered the special, and it seemed like a damn good price. So visit #2 started off with a game of matching what the special combo consisted of vs. items on the menu (detailed in English).   ~$60 special (that supposedly feeds 5.....i had a party of 3 :D) consisted of: - pork belly barbeque (generous portions; fat was able to drip off so it wasn't overwhelming) - mussel soup - choice of 1 bottle of sake or 5 bottles of beer - fish stew - buckwheat noodles - the usual table full of side dishes - (complimentary sample of assorted meats & blood sausage)  so. bomb."}
{"text":"There are many top notch korean restaurants just north of finch station.  Even between these, this restaurant stands out. Great food, large portions, at very reasonable prices. Although the service can be slow, it's only because the restaurant gets super busy - something they are trying to correct given the waitress wanted signs everywhere.  I ordered Jjam Pong, a spicy seafood noodle soup. The noodle was cooked just right, the soup spicy enough for \"a kick\" but notind numbingly so, and they did not skimp on the seafood, as many other places often do. I wasn't very hungry but ended up almost finishing the whole thing.  10/10 would go back again."}
{"text":"Nice family owned business with very friendly staff.  Price here is pretty good and portion is big.  Everyone gets a little private booth which was amazing.  Service was quick and food was very good.  Waiting to come back a 2nd time to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Location/Service: Right at the interaction of Yonge and Cummer (McNicoll). There's a small parking lot available, but gets filled pretty quick - so may have to look around. The restaurant inside have traditional/private rooms, spacious enough for families and large groups.  Service was okay, expected since it's more of an Asian local restaurant. Staff are accommodating and they helped us change to a larger table after we ordered our food.   Food: They have an extensive menu and specials posted on the wall (be sure to check them out!) We ordered one of their specials - which is a set meal for 4 (enough to feed for 6) and there were 3 dishes + 1 soup.  Sweet & sour fried chicken - really liked this dish. The chicken meat was still soft inside and large in quantity. There's not a lot of batter and an abundance of sauce available to do second dips or add it to your rice.  Bulgogi Grill - the meat comes raw and it gets cooked slowly. Cooking is done by you, so you can control how raw you want the meat to be. There's also mushrooms and onions, which adds in a good caramelized taste. And the meat was fresh as well.  Seafood Pancake - like any other Korean restaurants, it has leek shrimp/octopus. Large portion as well and it was thin, not overly battered.  Soup (no picture) - it was peppery spicy, not too suitable for my tasting. Okay dish for me.  We also ordered a family Chapchae - which again was abundant in quantity and a nice mix of onion, mushroom, beef and peppers.   The restaurant overall serves decent family style Korean food. Most of the dishes were consistent and it's very suitable during winter/summer for soups/bbq and hang-out with friends/big parties."}
{"text":"The rice cake soup is so good! It comes with beef and egg, which makes the soup taste so Unami!! Love it! The Korean beer and rice wine are awesome, smooth and not so strong! We stayed until 1am, and definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"I have always came here for Korean food since I live across the street and the food was pretty decent. However after being a regular of that place, one night they gave me a porkbone soup with VERY little meat and all bones. When I showed it to them they said that is how it supposed to be and they didn't do anything. So I'm never going back again. Instead I go to the Korean restaurant diagonally across from it which is very good and has consistent good portions."}
{"text":"Very mediocre Korean restaurant. I've had the spicy Rice cakes, hand cut noodle soup, black bean noodle, and some of their stews and it's all very average so I'm confused about the 4 star rating.  Fluorescent lights and the place could use a makeover. Hasn't been renovated in years.  I had a fruit fly in my soup in my clam based noodle soup. It happens but still. Made me lose my appetite.  A lot of adults are there sometimes getting drunk off the soju combos. Be prepared to sit near sloppy people late at night.  Oh yah, parking sucks too."}
{"text":"Why nobody recommend Jajangmyeon? That's my favorite dishes and it is super delicious!! I have been there for around 3-4 times and it becomes my favorite Korean food restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is on point with their food, no complaints there! Only issue I can see is with service, perhaps under staffed or what ever it is it doesn't seem like they are very happy. On the positive side, they have tons of booths, who doesn't love a booth!  The food is one of the best Korean food I have had, every thing was made perfect! Side dishes were better then most placeS, kimchi was well made and fresh!   perfect! Ad"}
{"text":"Got the spicy seafood noodle soup and it was delicious with the right amount of spice. The whiting fish soup came out a bit later and damn are these portions massive! Him and I were getting pretty filled from the noodles. And we re taking the leftover broth to go so we can eat with rice later :)))"}
{"text":"Update! I've been back here twice now and have discovered my new obsession:  Soon tofu chigae.   I've had Soon Tofu once downtown and wasn't a fan, but I had it again here with my friends and LOVED it. I came back yesterday to have a bowl all to myself and yup, LOVED IT.   The broth was a bit on the salty side, but other wise perfect, with large pieces of meltingly soft tofu as well as seafood and pork. So perfect. I'm basically counting the days until I can return again."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant I've had in awhile! Authentic and tasty. good service and individual booths to serve your party comfortably. We had a group of 6 and ordered a set meal that came with noodles (and some veggies) in soup, seafood pancake, Tangsuyuk (Sweet, sour, and crispy pork), bulgogi in a pot where the server cooked for us, and pork bone soup, and of course several side dishes. The portions were generous, and we were full by the end of dinner! I craved for more veggies in the noodle soup but honestly it was quite a perfect meal and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Next time I would like to have a few drinks over dinner - can't wait to go back for another round! :)"}
{"text":"What do you get when you combine good prices, good selection, and good food? You get a nice family atmosphere restaurant called Chowon. It's just a little north of Finch station. Every time I've come here, it seems at least semi-busy if not packed. That's a good sign.   Whether you are here to get drunk or to try some authentic Korean dishes, Chowon has something for you. They don't have any specialties, they have everything and all the dishes I've tried are good. I once had the table cooking pork belly (sam gyeop sal). The menu says it's good for 2 people but I swear it's for 3 people. It even comes with bean paste soup. Of course, it comes with rice. Recently I had their baby octopus. It was spicy just the way I like it and it comes with tons of vegetables and rice cakes too. Everything I've had is very delicious, very well priced, and large portions.   If you want to get drunk with a bunch of friends, they have many combos. Meal of various choices + 5 beers or 1 soju. Good times.   To me, Korean cuisine isn't a fine dining cuisine. I like Chowon enough to give it 5 stars because it's not pretentious. It doesn't feel as watered down or westernized as other places I've tried. If you go to Korea, a lot of restaurants will feel like Chowon.  I don't think it's reasonable for any reviewer to dock stars for service or decor. This places isn't trying to be a fine dining French/Italian restaurant. It's also the norm to use the bell to ring servers. In Korea, many restaurants are serviced by Ajuma (older ladies). Besides, Chowon has really nice Ajuma."}
{"text":"Awesome food and we had a nice waitress. We had the samgyupsal combo with the tofu soup and it was absolutely delicious and so authentic! Everything was flavoured nicely and wasn't overly salty like a lot of other Korean restaurants. The portions were great and we were stuffed after, I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered a few items to share among a family of 6 adults.  Seafood hot pot, $25.99 Jajiangmyeon (black bean noodle soup), $15.99 Japchae, $15.99 Seafood green onion pancake, about $15  The noodle dishes: Both noodle dishes were probably the best tasting I've ever had. Flavours was just right, especially the ja jiang myeon sauce because it wasn't too salty like some places does it. I also really like the texture of the ja jiang myeon noodle; Not sure if they make this noodle in-house (walked by the back kitchen and saw hands working a large container of flour), but it is really smooth and chewy.  The seafood green onion pancake was good, but not sure if it's worth the price.  The seafood hot pot. I do appreciate fresh fish and certainly don't even normally mind eating Chinese steamed whole fish with bones and all, but the fish bones in this dish was too much. The fishes here did tasted fresh, at least not fishy, but there were too much small, microscopic bones on these things, making them very hazardous to eat. The bones were tiny and short like on sardines, but they weren't soft enough to swallow like sardines, and was very annoying to go through. Aside from the bony fish meats, there were a good bunch of small clams and tofu. The soup was very orange in colour and of adequate spice level, but lack much seafood taste in itself. I didn't think it was worth $26.  Overall, I like the noodle dishes but didn't think they are worth the price of about $15 each. Ja jiang myeon didn't use any meat or seafood and I thought $15 is a bit much for plain noodles and sauce. Japchae had a tiny barely visible trace of beef mostly peppers and noodle, not worth $15 either. I would rather the dish be cut in half along with the price and that way people, especially smaller group or a couple can leave room to try other things.  Seems like the combos with beer are good and this would be a good place to come if you are a group of 6 or more. Otherwise, the price and dish sizes are not exactly made for dinner for 2, or allow room to share and try much more dishes.  Taste ok but not good value. On the fence about returning."}
{"text":"We came here because it has good review. We had 7 people and went to a  private room. At first when we order it was good and everything came pretty quick. We had the older waitress. Not too long later a younger waitress came starting serving us is where the disappointment start. We found she was rude because the way she talk to us. We order the BBQ pork belly. The romain wrap that comes with it. Each play if romain only has 5 or 6 piece. Each of us only can have 1 each for 30 piece of pork belly. Then we ask for another the waitress said we have to finish the romain first??? So we finish and the second plate of romain came. After we finish the plate of romain we still have 10 piece of pork belly so we ask for one more romain. The waitress said we have to pay $2.99? I thought it would come free with the combo. So we agreed. We ask for more kimchi and she said we can't get no more after second time. The waitress is very demanding. When the bill came they didn't charge us $2.99 but it's too late . Damage is already done. We will not come back."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. Unfortunately I didn't remember the food tasting so bland the first time I came here (within the last year), or I would not have come again. Ordered the seafood pancake and the spicy seafood noodle - the pancake was essentially a spring onion pancake as it barely had any seafood (which makes it quite expensive at $19.99) and although the noodle looked very spicy, it was flavorless."}
{"text":"Chowon is known for their soft tofu stew/soup. But the thing to know is that this restaurant does home cooked food. Practically everything is made in house, including the tofu. And there are little to no preservatives used in the process. For that reason, most of the food is a little on the bland side but it's therefore generally healthier.  The panfried dumplings are crispy and delicious. And it goes without saying that their stew is also amazeballs. They also serve makkoli which is a korean fermented rice wine beverage, which is also made in house. It is less sweet than the store bought versions and kicks a bit of a punch. I'm not a fan but my friend loves it. And at under $20 for the... 1.5 liters or so... it's a great deal. You can drink in store and then whatever you have left she will seal for you so you can take it back home.   One thing to note is that she is a rude no nonsense kind of lady, so if at all possible, don't ask questions. Just order and stay out of her way. Lol. But seriously.   Washroom is in the basement."}
{"text":"Great food, nice booth style seating, but limited space. Ate there tonight and was asked to leave so that the next customers could be seated. Weren't rude or anything, but it was a little weird.   Would recommend for a date night."}
{"text":"Mother dearest is out of town, so daddy and I are trying new foods! We'll bring mommy later.  We had the samgyupsal (pork belly) table cooking for two. $33.99 on the menu? Something like that. Comes with tofu soup or soy bean soup, lettuce (for wrapping), two sauces (one tasted like peanut oil and salt, and the other was ssamjang (a spicy seasoned bean paste), raw garlic slices (for putting in your wraps) and two bowls of white rice. We chose tofu. Weird that for a two person combo, they give you one person's serving of soup...one bowl of it. Banchan (side dishes) for the night were kimchi, pickled radish, kimchi radish cubes, bean sprouts, japchae, and broccoli. Very good portion of samgyupsal, and the quality of it was great. Not bacon type pork belly. There were strips of fat, but small strips, so when we cooked it, what remained after cooking was tender meat without huge chunks of fat. Delicious. The meat also came with a large slice of onion.   I was quite concerned about the raw garlic, but the samgyupsal holds its own and the garlic doesn't overwhelm. My favorite wrap of the night (self-made, of course) was lettuce (duh), bite of rice, slice of garlic, piece of kimchi, slivers of pickled radish, and samgyupsal dipped in both sauces.   I don't know if there's a cap on banchan refills, but the cap on lettuce refills is one.   After we had eaten our fill, we had at least a third of our samgyupsal left, half a bowl of rice and all of our soup (we didn't even touch the soup because we had too much food). Total damage before tips came to just over $38.  Attentive service. Surprisingly good English by the staff. They have some private booths with buzzers/bells to get service. Those actually work. The servers respond. Nice thing about private booths is that there are cushions for the wooden benches. Will be back."}
{"text":"For over 5 years Chowon has been my restaurant of choice whenever I need to satisfy my urges for authentic Korean cuisine. Recently, their service has declined tremendously. You can forget about having any sort of service during prime time especially if you don't speak Korean. You'll find yourself waiting with no acknowledgment and others coming long after you will be seated before you. On many occasions we've found ourselves alienated and left with no choice but to walk out the door because of terrible treatment. Don't get me wrong, if the restaurant is not busy, you may be pleased with the food. Just a word of caution, for mediocre food and terrible treatment I'm confident that you can find a much better alternative down the street."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Korean food. They have all the usual dishes. I had the Dakgogi Dup Bap which was good, the portion was size was fairly large and the amount of chicken in the dish was fair. They give all the usual side dishes as well. Service was a little bit slow."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count, and there's a good reason for that, hombre. The food is top notch, especially for the price. My family can stuff ourselves for less than 40 dollars on some nights (depending on what we get). We've never had the KBBQ here, but according to my friends, it's as good as it can get. Cheap, delicious, with good service to boot.  It's situated in an odd corner (about a 7 minutes walk North from Yonge and Finch on your left), but I'd definitely recommend this place (especially if you're on a budget). My favourite dish is the Pork Bone Soup (called \"Gam Ja Tang\" in traditional Korean). Try it out! It's spicy, meaty, and delicious."}
{"text":"My fav Korean food!  The kampoongi is the best here!  It's just the right amount of spicy and sweet.  From the noodles to the soups, I don't think I've ordered something and not liked it.    We tried a different place closer to home last time but were disappointed.  Oh Cho Won, will you ever forgive me?  I will not stray again!  I promise!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Three star goes to the food. This is my second visit to this restaurant and what happened today urged me to leave a review.  No star for service.  Terrible experience today at this restaurant. We went into the restaurant in the middle of a thunderstorm. The inner room is full according to the waitress (around her 40s). She asked us to sit in the outer room. But there's a huge fan(maybe A/C) that's blowing out wind.   I told her can I wait for table inside, she went into the kitchen without letting me finish my words. After that, I tried to keep that talking saying \"Excuse me\" to her. She went back to me with Chinese (maybe she heard me speaking Chinese with friends). I told her it's the wind that's making me uncomfortable and I may get sick (since I've been working outside for all day, and I got caught in the thunderstorm).  She laughed at me saying why didn't other people get sick?   She also said she asked me to wait at the desk since its hard for her to walk around if I stand and wait. But she put the menus on desk already, and didn't tell me it's for waiting at all.   I'm so pissed off and decide to leave.   How can a waitress work with no smile, doesn't let her customer finish his first sentence, and also laugh at him???   Really????"}
{"text":"I'm rarely impressed by the food at Korean restaurants. I usually find it expensive and not that amazing. But my experience at Chowon makes me reconsider my previous dining experiences and consider the fact that I might have been doing it wrong. I think maybe the key is that you need a larger group so that you can take advantage of the set meals. That way you can taste everything and not get stuck eating one single dish.  Came on a Saturday with 7 people and was given a spacious booth in the back. We ordered the set meal (originally meant for 4 people) and an order of pork bone soup.  It was plenty of food for the 7 of us, with everyone full and happy by the end of the meal. We had the grilled beef lettuce wraps (which came with a large mound of meat), fried chicken in a lemon sauce, ramen and rice cakes in a spice broth and an oyster pancake. Don't know if it was because it was a set meal, but the portions were sizeable and there was plenty to go around.   The service doesn't come with a smile but it's efficient. They made an obvious effort to time the dishes so they didn't all come at once to our tiny table. It was appreciated. Definitely one of my better Korean dining experiences."}
{"text":"The table cooking was great, lots of food for 2 people for about 50 bucks all in. Service is typical of family style Korean restaurants but it certainly wasn't rude. I would certainly go back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant for pork bone soup in North York. The pork bone soup hot pot for 2 has lots of meat, and is usually fall off the bone and tasty! All entrees come with 6 appetizer dishes. The tofu and fish cake are absolutely delicious!  There was once where 6 of us went, and 2 people wanted a hotpot for each person. They gave a very slightly bigger pot with maybe 1 or 2 bones more and charged for 2 pots price for two people to share with reasoning that there was not enough table space. Needless to say, they were very unhappy and likely would not come back again. That was my first and only bad experience with Chowon and I have been coming here for Korean food for over 4-5 years now.   Overall a great family style restaurant with good food, and usually busy (but not so busy that you have to wait forever for a seat)."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is great. Everything we tried was excellent and seems very fresh and authentic. Brought the family back to try it and they all loved it as well. I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Dukboki $7.99 - I thought it was a bit on the hard side like it wasn't too fresh. Usually its much softer and chewier.  Noodles with vegetables $16.99 - there was enough noodles to feed 2-3 people. Came with enough red pepper paste to burn the tongue a bit. Noodles had nice texture and chewiness to them.  Side dishes: lettuce, bean sprouts, kimchii, sweet radish, kimchii flavored radish and peanuts with little dried fish  The meal was good but nothing really stood out for me. I saw another table doing Korean BBQ with lettuce wrap so there is still a chance that I return, especially since Jennifer K. posted such a nice picture of marbleized meat."}
{"text":"First time here as I decided to try a different Korean restaurant and I was fairly impressed by how great the service and food was.   We ordered the Soon tofu and Gamjatang which came with six different side dishes. I ordered the Soon tofu and at other restaurants it usually isn't very spicy and flavour is average but I was very content with it this time around. It was fairly spicy and surprised it also had good amounts of seafood in the stew as well. My friend got the  Gamjatang and it wasn't spicy enough for her, so she asked for jalapeno peppers which made it much better.   The prices were average for Korean food, the soups/stews ranged from $6.99-$9.99 and there were also options for hot pot and table top cooking. It ranged from $14.99-$39.99 (More expensive for table top cooking obviously lol!).   The service was fairly good, they were friendly and greeted us when we arrived and also when we were leaving as well. The waitress smiled and although it was fairly busy on a Friday evening, the food, service and overall quality was top notch. I would definitely come back here to try out the table top cooking and recommend this restaurant to others. It's a refreshing change from the other Korean restaurants I have been to."}
{"text":"Not too bad.   I like the feel of this place. It feels very homey and the food is ok.   Came here on a whim, since the SO was feeling for Korean, but not any of our usual spots.   The food was pretty decent. I like the banchan quite a bit.    What is different about this place is that all seating is booth style.   There are a handful of weird things that is amusing, but jarring at the same time. The choice of music is kinda EDC, so heavy on the beats - which is completely at odds with the cozy family vibe they have going on.    Also, because this is a two unit space restaurant- the staff seems to hang out on one side of the space leaving you to your own devices for most part. Which is ok - but I found that their buzzer system doesn't quite work that well and I had to go and track them down a handful of times.   Overall, not too bad."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for ages!   The best ¿jajamyun? In my opinion and great flavours for everything I've had. The spicy fried chicken (kind of like a sweet and sour pork) and the tangsuyuk are must haves!!!   The dumpling and rice cake soup was fantastic with a delicious soup and good dumplings and rice cakes and the spicy fiddlehead soup was hot and flavourful and full of meat and veggies.   The small side dishes were delicious and a nice touch!   Prices seem to be going up, but still one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"I already know they have great Korean BBQ. But can they make pork bone soup? THAT, my friends, is the question of the day.   And the answer is.......  OOooooOOoo YEA they can!!!  5 pieces of meaty bones in a perfect bowl of soup with just the right amount of spice, served with rice, and 6 delicious side dishes for $6.99. Great value but even better is the great taste. I am so happy and satisfied =)  My verdict: Chowon makes the best pork bone soup in Toronto. Now you go be the judge of that."}
{"text":"Yum. Nothing like Korean BBQ on a day where an extreme cold weather alert was issued, something that would heat up your body and tastes delicious at the same time!  I originally wanted to go to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu, but my dad complained about the lack of selections. Fair enough. After some texts sent to one of my friends, I came across this place. It certainly did not disappoint me.  The layout of this restaurant looks like your typical traditional Korean restaurant overseas...I think? It definitely had that authentic feeling though, which made me confident this is an authentic place in terms of Korean cuisine. The prices were also extremely reasonable, compared to the place I used to frequent by Yonge and Finch (at least half the price for table cooking!).  I had the table cooking option with marinated beef for two. The beef was marinated very well, plentiful, and sweet. The soontofu was also quite good, not very oily or salty. Most importantly though service was excellent; we were attended to the whole way and the waitress even explained the orders since it was our first time.  Definitely a must-try and will come back."}
{"text":"Come here all the time for the gamja tang. Best I ever had, and I've eaten a lot. The staff is also very friendly and the service is fast. Definitely would recommend going here. They also have really neat booths where the tables are very private and there's a button to call the servers."}
{"text":"Family style korean restaurant with a fairly standard food selection, large portions and good taste. I enjoyed my experience at Chowon!  Located off Yonge Street in the North York Korean town, Chowon looks physically in need of a makeover and parking is quite challenging in the small plaza the restaurant is located in. Service was also very standard and acceptable.   Why I give this place 4/5 is because the food did impress me. We ordered a set meal that came with a Bibimbap, korean style fried chicken, BBQ pork belly and a seafood pancake - all for a very reasonable price. The portions were extremely generous and I found all the dishes above average when it came to taste in comparison to Korean restaurants with similar menus (which are a lot of them).  I'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Great kampunggi (korean sweet and spicy chicken), portion is huge, chicken are always freshly cooked and crispy. Sauce are tasty and just right, not too sweet.  The place is a family friendly resto, its great for small and big group. Not too noisy and it's got a lot of booth so lots of privacy! :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has special meaning to me: I had my lunch there for almost half year during my first job, maybe not every day, but definitely more than 2 times a week. Given the fact that I am  a huge fan of Korean food, and always ready to try new Korean restaurants, I am pretty confident to say that Chowon Family Restaurant serves top-notch Korean food at an unbelievably price.    This restaurant is around Yonge and Drewry Street and it is kinda easy to pass by, because it is surrounded by laundry shop and tiny grocery store. This restaurant is very family restaurant, the decoration, the service style.....   Their lunch menu is amazing. For less than $10, you can get a big bowl of tofu soup, rice, and six side dishes. The soup is very delicious and not as spicy as it looks. Some people may say their service is not very good, but I think it is just very Asian-Style. They take your order, serve the food, and leave you alone.   I would say it is one of the best place for lunch if you work around Yonge and Finch."}
{"text":"So this is chowon's bibimbap with barely even an ounce of beef in it. Went back to bring it to their attention thinking that they just forgot to add the meat, they said that was the actual amount of meat that went in there. Wow. What a ripoff. So frustrating. Got pork bone soup to go too... Hope it doesnt disappoint."}
{"text":"Went there last night.  It was definitely soju-night for the Ajossis and Ajumonis!  Lots of laughter and good times (why not)!?  The ttukbegae here is good - all the chigaes are good.  Hubby had kimchi-chigae - delish.  My champong did not hit the spot - it was missing a significant amount of seafood and the broth did not have a deep flavour like in the past.  They gave me garlic slices and samjang on the side (I asked for it) and it helped.  THE HAEMOOL PAJON WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS, not dripping in oil and perfectly cooked.  This is old-style home made Korean food.  I would have given them a five if not for the lacklustre champong.  This place is very nice.  The wait staff here are nice and work very hard to keep everyone happy."}
{"text":"$30 for a table cooking combo that includes 1 sojo (or 5 beers)? Sign me up!  This family owned restaurant serves delicious food, has efficient service and great prices. I have been coming here for many years and have consistently enjoyed my experience here - whether with a large group or just the two of us with a big appetite.   Their appetizers are worth mentioning: delicious, some of the best kimchi I've ever had in the city! The servers are mindful to bring these out quickly.   If you are driving here, there is limited parking so if all the spots are taken, there is a street just behind the restaurant you can park at for free.   Last note: the ventilation at this place isn't great so be prepared to leave the restaurant smelling like Korean BBQ for the rest of the night (and possibly do laundry when you get home). Don't wear that favorite cashmere sweater of yours to this restaurant unless you want to take it to get dry cleaned the next day."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Seems like a nice homey family restaurant.  Servers seem nice and was there when you wanted them. Side dishes were so so, they were all pickled something and lacked variety.  We ordered pork bone (how you judge every korean place) and pig intestines (cuz if u don't make it, order it).  Pork bone was okay but small in portion.  The intestine was.....so chewy that it could not be eaten, u basically had to soften it up with your chewing then swallow the piece whole.  Now disclaimer, it is the first time I had it made by a Korean place and the waitress said that's how it suppose to be (I asked her to eat a piece and wanted to see how long she chewed on it for) so I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that that is how its suppose to be.  I myself won't order it again.  I am use to soft and can be chewed into small pieces before ingesting."}
{"text":"They had great food before renovation, and now they have better interior with more food options. Had their squid tangsoo(fried squid in sauce), budaechigae (spicy soup with sausages, spam,kimchi and tofu), hwae moochim(spicy raw fish with leaf veggies) , mak chang (bbq pig intestine), and LA Galbi. Not one dish disappointed my party. I think this is the only place that offers fried squid. It's similar to sweet and sour pork but its made with squid so the texture is different. They precook Table bbq mak chang and galbi so you can enjoy your food faster. Try their fruit soju too! Goes perfect with mak chang and hwae moochim!"}
{"text":"Used to love going to this restaurant. The place doesn't have heating in the winter but the food made up for it. They only have a few booths so if it's busy they stick you at one of the tables at the front with no \"call/service\" button.   Haven't been to the restaurant since last year because we didn't get any service last time and it wasn't the first time this happened. They came and took our order and didn't check up on us. We needed more tea and wanted a refill on our side dishes and we tried to wave down service but it felt like they were ignoring us. We were pissed off, left still thirsty and my fiancé didn't leave a tip and the owner had a shocked look on his face when he saw no tip. How about actually providing service and then you'll actually get a tip?!?! I served for 5 years and if I didn't provide service then I wouldn't be surprised if there was no tip.   Loved the food but need the service in order to eat there. Beware!!"}
{"text":"Try: Pork Bone Soup  Very decent Korean restaurant. The pork bone soup was so satisfying and filling. I find their food to be on a more garlicky side, but to quote a Korean friend, if it's not garlicky it's not real Korean food.   Parking was a hassle given the right space and limited spots... You need to be extra dedicated to the restaurant to make the trek."}
{"text":"My friends and I are regulars here, we've been going for as long as i can remember.  They seem to change owners every couple years, and it's always been good.  The new owners are even better, portions are big, service is relatively quick, and prices are very reasonable.  If you like beer they have beer+dish combo's which are very cheap (off the top of my head i think it's ~$25 for a large plate of kanpunggi and 5 domestic beers).  Their dolsot bibimbap is my personal favourite dish there.   There's a couple large public tables in the front, but every other table is in a private booth-style setup.  They're usually busy (especially on Friday/Saturday around dinner time) so if you have a large group you can call to make reservations.  Parking can be a headache sometimes as the parking lot is quite small, but you can park across the street so it's never been an issue.  I go here every couple weeks and will definitely continue to!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to the restaurant. First time, we dined-in and also did a take out of lamb soup. When we reheated the soup, I found about 8-10 creatures that looked like a mosquito (smaller) floating around lifelessly.  I wasnt sure if it flew in from outside when I was reheating it or if it traveled with us from the resto, so I just threw it out.  Second time, my dad ordered the same soup to dine - in, and guess what I find? Those same  creatures. I hate to admit, but the soup and other food items are pretty tasty, but I would question their kitchen hygiene.   This resto itself is not the cleanest either and service is almost non-existent. They have bbq cooking but the vent never seems to be on, so I would not recommend wearing your favourite wardrobe here, if you still plan to go.  For me, I definitely would not return."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!  Not super cheap, but for what you get prices are definitely reasonable. Huge portions, all made with good ingredients. Everything comes out fresh and cooked just right. I have yet to send something back or feel like it hasn't been made well. (Plus cheap beer!)  My go to dishes are:  1) duk bo ki (rice cakes) - not the best there is, but always good and fresh, and pretty spicy!  2) Kang poong gi (fried chicken in a garlic sauce) - amazing. the portion is HUGE and  so fresh and just the right amount of batter. Super saucy without making the batter soggy. (and note: I normally dislike chicken dishes, or chicken in general).    3) kalbi (beef short ribs) - really tender and generally good cuts of meat. Better than the kalbi at most of the other k restaurants around ynf  4) kimchi buchim (korean pancake) - the best there is. perfectly fried, perfect thin-ness, and never gloppy/under-cooked in the middle, like it is at a lot of places. fillled with flavour. probably my favourite dish here.   5) jap chae (stir fried noodle with vegetables) - lots of veggies and meat, always comes out super hot and fresh, and never gets too 'sticky' or 'clumpy'. one of the best places for jap chae.  It's a little hidden and not a ton of parking, but definitely a place to check out in the Yonge and Finch area!"}
{"text":"Both the soon tofu seafood soup and pork bone soup is good.  One of the best pork bone soup I've tried. They don't hide behind tonnes of salt (some place msg) to attempt to enhance the flavor.  I can actually taste the ingredients in the soup.  One question,. I thought it is customary that there is potato in the pork bone soup?  The side dishes are also fresh and nicely pickled..   Ventilation is a bit lacking for BBQ.  They have to open the door at times to air out the smoke.  Glad it is not winter now."}
{"text":"My review updated : I previously gave it a 5 star,  did NOT know what i was thinking,  trying the pork bone soup again,.....  And again,  no potatoes,  was a disappointment.  Between the 4 of us,  we could barely finish the hot pot pork bone soup for 17.99$. The waitress told us it's made for 2 people,  which didn't make sense since 1 costed about 7$ x2= $14, isn't hot pot supposed to be a better deal?  Dishonest waitress that tries to get people to buy more is my biggest pest. I was very pleased with the soup the first time I tried it,  but sometimes you need to try something a few times to truly know if it's that good..  And clearly it's not."}
{"text":"I love Noodles!!   A bite of the Homemade Noodles at Chowon Family Restaurant and I knew that this is one of the best noodle I have!  Bajirak Kalguksu - Manila Clams Noodle Soup ($7.99) - The noodle is the star! Cook al dente with this great bite! - The broth has this really light delicate taste and with tons of clams!  Spicy Seafood Hot Pot ($14.99) - If you are into fish, you would love this dish - If you are hungry, you would be stuffed - If you are into noodles,  you will be in heaven - I wish this is more spicy - This definitely not that live seafood hot pot I had before with all those seafood tossed in alive.. but good enough at this price!  Services is A-OK! I got everything I need and wanted and more with a smile!  I was hoping that I can get the noodles at a store, but the lady told me they made everything in the kitchen themselves.. I guess I need to come back to Chowon for that oh so good noodle!  Me Want Noodles!!"}
{"text":"So full! I am really full!! aish~~  Had my first Samgyeopsal grilled pork belly here. It says for 2, but I think 3 is better. And with a seafood pajeon, it is really good here. If only I was not so full~~"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Chowon about 10 times now, but in all but one visit, have only ever ordered the same dish. That would be the kamponggi, which is a korean style sweet-n-sour chicken.  This place makes an amazing kamponggi and the $13 dish can easily feed 2 or 3 people.  We usually order a bowl of rice each to go with it.    I just went there again on Saturday at 1pm for lunch and we decided to order a second dish since there were 4 of us there this time and settled on a seafood casserole (haemul jeongol for $20) . That was a mistake. Sure, the plate was gigantic... but it was a huge mound of soybean sprouts!! There was an okay amount of seafood mixed in here and there, but honestly... gigantic plate of beansprouts.  The kamponggi was also soggy beneath all the sauce... usually it's crispy, even with the sauce on top of it.  Service was horrible on this day, the lady who served us seemed to hate us, dropped off food and turned away so fast we could barely ask for stuff, ignored our bell, didn't bring us rice until 15 mins after we got our kamponggi, and took the menu away .. while my friend was reading it o_O Could be because we were the only ones in there not speaking Korean?  I was super embarassed since I had touted this place so much and it was their first time there *SIGH*  All the other times, I'd gone on a Sunday lunch with a friend.. right when they open at 12 and was served by another lady who was always nice to us. I'm not going to pan them for the last visit, and I just love their kamponggi too much BUT will stick to going on a Sunday as before!!"}
