{"text":"Got the Brooklyn Stromboli.  The thing was awful!  The crust was wrapped around a ton of cheese and a single layer of pepperoni.  There couldn't have been more than six slices of pepperoni in the thing.  I should have gotten a slice of pizza instead."}
{"text":"Four people behind the counter and none could be bothered to get me a Stromboli! Bravo! With service like this I wouldn't expect them to be around long."}
{"text":"Terrible service on Saturday, 14 May 2016 at 5:57PM. Two ladies working the counter were oblivious to customers. I asked one of them where the line began (mind you I was the second person to get there). She just indicated with her index finger to wait. No verbal, nothing. The next customer that comes to the line asks the same thing: where do you order. The same employee gave her he same index finger indicating to wait. The other rudely asked her (the customer) \"what'cha want?\"  I walked away. Can't tell you how the food tasted since they did not bother taking my order and honestly, I would not risk it given the poor ownership the employees demonstrated at the pizza parlor. Garbage."}
{"text":"Finally found somewhere in this airport that's worth the money. I had the meatball sub with the spicy sauce. It is not super spicy, just had a little heat. The bread is great and so are the meatballs. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"PZA has really good pizza (and not just really good pizza 'for an airport') but actually great crisp crust, flavorful mozzarella, and fresh-out-of-the-stone-oven taste! I grabbed a pepperoni slice on my first layover there (the guy could have left it to warm a BIT longer in the oven) but it was still delicious and crisp. I was passing through again on my way home and it was 9am and this was by far the most delicious breakfast pizza I've ever had! Grab the AM Pizzeta (personal sized pizza only available before lunch and, in my opinion, better than the by-the-slice option). The AM Pizzeta has spinach, loads of crunchy bacon, mozzarella, and an EGG on it - seriously delicious. So yeah, I am a fan.  Also, I walk the entire airport when I have long layovers (and to get my steps in) so I saw what else the terminals have to offer and PZA in Terminal E is, by far, the BEST option."}
{"text":"I saw this place had received positive reviews from some local bloggers, so with only a few minutes to spare on between flights, I got two slices. I got a slice of sausage and crispy eggplant. Both slices were warmed in the oven and in my hand within five minutes, very good timing.   The crust was fine, not too thick, not too thin, and crunchy. I did have a decent sized air bubble in the sausage slice, which I'm not a fan of. The toppings were ok, the breading was decent on the eggplant with a little bit of crunch. The sausage was cut into really thick slices, it was pretty  good.   However, where this pizza dies is the sauce. On their wall, they boast the Sauce is the Boss. Well if this sauce was my boss, I'd have quit my job. It was a dark red, it tasted like old burnt tomato. No herbs, no spices, there was nothing about it that resembled pizza sauce at all.   Also, there's no oregano shaker and both the Parmesan and crushed red pepper sat out all day in little plastic packets. Fifteen dollars for two slices and a fountain drink, it was not worth it, I cannot go back there."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. There were 2 young girls working that night and they were extremely rude, making facial gestures and not being polite. I'm not from North Carolina, so I'm not sure if this is proper customer service?  Was here on a layover, the pizza was mediocre. They warm it again and it was just warm, not hot."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza I've ever had. Old pizza that just sits there under the light and they throw it in the oven for like 20 seconds. If you have the time you're better off walking to California pizza kitchen"}
{"text":"I was delighted to find PZA at the intersection of E terminal.  I am hesitant to try pizza outside of NY/Philly/Chicago and even more hesitant in an airport, but PZA was a pleasant culinary surprise.  Thin crust pizza with a slightly spicy sauce that added a nice flavor.  I ordered the meatball/sausage and both were spot on.  Of course, it was on the expensive side but what isn't.  I was kind of between meals so I only ate half a slice, but the strombolis looked amazing.  I will be back to try an Italian soon.  Plenty of bar type single seating, but minimal tables."}
{"text":"Chilling about, waiting for my plane to come... I needed a snack, but ended up with a slightly larger than medium pizza. I guess any pizza can be a personal pizza if you try hard enough!  It's a little confusing if you've never been there before. They don't tell you how to order or where to go. They kind of just stand there and wait for you to figure out what to do. They were all in some kind of funk, too. No smiles, no hello-how-ya-doin. Just a whole lotta blank stares.   The guy working the oven eventually asked me what I wanted after he finished with his conversation. I ordered the pizza with bacon and egg (about $7.50, I think) because it was breakfast time and I felt like I could justify having pizza. Took them a few minutes to reheat it and I was on my way back to my gate... which was 20 feet away. Yeah, I was in no hurry.  The flavour was very very unique. I couldn't place where I knew the taste from, but it caught my attention. I've never had a pizza with that bite or tang to it. It was actually pleasant. The egg yolk hardened the second time in the oven, so no ooey-gooey-drippy yolk action, but still plenty of eggy flavour. I should have asked what the green stuff was. Way too savoury to be spinach, but way too thin to be kale. The crust had a nice crunch and it paired surprisingly well with my iced green tea latte and asiago bagel from Starbucks. I was being a carb piggy that morning. It filled me up and made me sleep through my plane ride. Good job, PZA."}
{"text":"I am currently at PZA enjoying a very fresh slice of delicious cheese pizza. I was a mere bite or two into my original slice when the Manager came over to my counter spot and said 'Don't eat that one, here is a fresh slice'. I didn't think my original slice looked old or appeared that it had been sitting out for a while (they put it in the brick oven for a few before serving it). However, I absolutely appreciate the Manager giving me a fresh, hot slice. What great customer service!!!  Pizza is very good, reasonably priced and ample places to sit w/plenty of electrical outlets nearby. Now, the Charlotte Airport wifi is another story and doesn't have a happy ending..."}
{"text":"Waited for a few minutes under the \"order here\" sign while the staff stood about ten feet away talking.  Gave up and went to Whisky River instead. Guess I'll have to agree with the other reviews about the poor service."}
{"text":"With the number of customers filing through this restaurant, you are likely to get a fresh slice of pizza. They were turning over lots of customers around midday. I got a cheese slice and a slice of mushroom spinach. Both were decent for airport pizza. I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Pizza was good (& I'm from NJ where pizza is king) but management should train staff to be friendly, smiling, and engaging with their customers. It's not that difficult. Leave your bad days and problems at home."}
{"text":"Good sweltering of pizzas calzone Stromboli and amazing meatballs!  This is not too short to post!"}
{"text":"6 inch meatball sandwich was kind of gross.  I am not really sure what the meat was and I could totally taste all the filling.  The sauce was just weird.  Bread was good but way too much.  Definitely will not be back if I am in \"E\" gates again"}
{"text":"It's worth my time just to tell you how rude and shitty this place is. Never eaten worse pizza. Also be prepared to spend 30 bucks on two slices and two canned beers. Save yourself, there are much better options for less money."}
{"text":"Excellent meatball sub.  Good pizza and stromboli selection.  Salads too.  Fast and easy.  Plenty of seating.  In E Concourse."}
{"text":"Had the meatball stromboli. Ok not great. Could have used some herbs, pepper, and garlic to kick up the flavor profile. Service was great. They moved it along fast which was key for me since I had little time to get to my transfer."}
{"text":"Eat somewhere else.   First gave my food order to another guest and same employee took my order again, oblivious to it. Pasta was terrible (and came out of a bag). Pizza was soggy despite being reheated in the oven, so who knows how long it was sitting there.   Ps- they charge you for spaghetti and meatballs despite  ordering and receiving only spaghetti (and was told 'that's how we do it, they should have told you when you ordered), which was $12."}
{"text":"Bad food and even worse service. I got a Stromboli that was literally more grease than it was bread sauce or meat. Nobody wanted to take my order and I was sent to three different people to take my order. Worse than that, the two cashiers talked to each other the entire time. They did provide a single bit of customer service. They didn't answer a question or couldn't even figure out to give me a marinara sauce which I later found out was right in front of them. These people don't deserve jobs and looking back I should have just left at that point and not even paid for the half ass Stromboli I got. Won't ever go back and really don't recommend you waste your time or money."}
{"text":"This place is Fast and great service. The food is super fresh and the people are willing to go the distance to explain the menu. They lady at the front was very nice and helpful. The cook came out and told me to wait 2 min because he had fresh everything coming out for breakfast. So everything was steaming hot with deliciousness.  The prices are a little steep been that we are at the airport so that's to be expected. But over all a great experience and I would definitely be back if I'm in this airport.

{"text":"The pizza was cold and bland and they rape you by charging 9 bucks for a can of beer.....the staff were one level above Neanderthals. Do not go here unless you are willing to waste money for crappy service and even crappier food. I will never coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"It was just okay! Nothing special but not nasty. I'm conflicted because I wanted something flavorful and cheap. I only had 20 minutes in-between flights so I went with the quickest less thought provoking item. I think the after taste is what's bothering me the most while I'm writing this review. Anyway it served its purpose and I only spent 5.99 cent so no harm, no foul! It's Super Bowl Sunday and I'm on my way to a great event. I didn't want to get to my destination and not be hungry.  If I have a layover in Charlotte again I would try another pizza spot but I would also have added garlic. The food looked amazing but it tasted like lil Caesar's pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while waiting for a flight out.  The options for food in concourse E are limited  and this was a nice change.    Food -   I got the large meatball sub and it was pretty big.   I think that you got a lot for your money but the sandwich was just ok.    Service -   I think that the service was ok.  It doesn't seem that any place in the airport provides good service.   It's weird to me that everyone just is going through the motions.  Really bugs me.    Restaurant - I like the decor and the fact that it is open.   The black and white tiles give it a pop and it is also good for people watching   This is one of the best options in concourse E"}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you can. I paid $11 for two very mediocre slices of pizza (no drink). Obviously not fresh and not a whole lot of taste regardless. There are definitely better options at the airport, both in terms of quality and bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I was trying to get a wuality quick bite at the airport on my way home from a long day of traveling and this place was just disappointing overall. The food was basic and overpriced. I got the meatball Stromboli, which only had meatball, cheese and Stromboli bread. It tastes like it had been sitting for awhile. The other kicker in the equation of disappoint was that it was roughly 13 dollars for a that sub a side of marinara and bottle of water. I would got one of the fast food chains before returning to Pza next time in Charlottes airport."}
{"text":"Charlotte is trying with their airport food but it's still not great.  This place is new since the last time I was there and it got the job done.  Fast pizza and Stromboli at a reasonable price.  The Stromboli was very good and did the trick for holding me over until I got home.  They're big enough to split and it's a good spot for airport people watching (my favorite travel pastime)."}
{"text":"I am a pizza guy for sure. I could eat it 4-5 times a week and be happy. So me knows a few things about pizza.   That said, I don't expect a lot from airport food but this was seriously one of the worst pieces of pizza I've ever eaten anywhere. I'm talking a step below Little Caesars or Totino's frozen.  Got a slice of sausage. One of the guys was going to give me a slice from the 'old' pan but the other guy pointed to the 'newer' pan. I don't know what the difference would have been but even after putting it in the oven it was soggy, wilted and old. Clearly it had been sitting there for a long time. And this was at 5:00PM (I would think prime time?). The sauce was weird and had large pieces (I mean 1/2\" x 2\") of onion. I like pizza sauce on my pizza, thank you very much, not chunky spaghetti sauce with giant pieces of onion.   Slice was $5.49 which is bad enough for a terrible slice of airport pizza. Add on to that a 16.9 oz bottle of Lipton Pure Leaf tea which cost , gulp, $5.19. Yes, $5.19 for a bottle of tea! Seriously? That's $.30 /oz.   I travel a lot through Charlotte and can tell you I will never go back to this place. I'll stick with Brookwood Farms BBQ in the main food court as I've never had a bad meal there yet."}
{"text":"It is clear that shear volume of food is more important than quality here. The decor is inviting and warm, but be forewarned the food is just plain inedible. I ordered the meatball Stromboli and a slice of plain cheese pizza. The Stromboli was undercooked with a raw dough Center and was totally flavorless. Was similar to eating glue.  The pizza was based upon a dough that could best be described as a thin Boboli. Bland and flavorless. A tomato sauce that was sugared and cheese with no flavor. One bite and the rest went in the trash. Quality control does not exist here. Plenty of other places to eat."}
{"text":"We had an early flight and didn't have time to eat breakfast on the way so it was a Calzone for breakfast type of morning and it was delicious. Hubby had Meatball and my Mom and I split an Italian. It was REALLY good....almost surprisingly good. Inflated prices are to be expected at the airport, but it was worth it this time. We were full for HOURS afterwards.   My only complaint...the cranky people that work there. I mean. seriously, if you work with the public can you at least pretend to care about customer service?"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service, with large pizza slices. The sauce & cheese on the pizza was ok, but the pizza dough wasn't very good. They ask to warm it up for you, but that won't help. The slice was white & doughy, not really golden brown at all, & with no crunch. There are plenty of other places to grab a bite in the airport. I'll pass by this one next time."}
{"text":"At first glance, PZA looks like a nicer, cooler, and more contemporary version of Sbarro. Signs with modern fonts and a wide variety of Italian fare may lure you in, but be warned: the pizza here is not good.   Killing time during my two-hour layover, I needed to grab a bite. So I came here and ordered two slices of mushroom/spinach pizza. The staff heated up the slices, handing each over in its own triangular box.   And then I started eating. Yikes. The pizza looked okay but the crust was extremely dry and hard. There's no way you can fold a slice without it breaking apart. And I couldn't even taste the toppings either.   So overall, I was not impressed, especially at around $5 per slice. Save yourselves the money and take your wallet elsewhere.   Hugs, C"}
{"text":"Strombi was not too bad in taste and flavor.  Unfortunately, it was only warm and not hot.  The service also took too long and was not so good because they lost my order."}
{"text":"Prepared pizzas that they slice and warm up, ready for you to eat here or take on the plane. Not cheap at around $5 a slice, but this is the airport and so you're going to have a limited selection.  The gent who put my slice in the oven was nice and the pizza was tasty.  It's half-way down the E terminal on the way to E10-15."}
{"text":"My expectation is already low for airport food but this was just bad on all levels. I ordered a \"classic\" slice (just cheese). They gave me a cold slice (I didn't know it was cold until I got all the way to my gate and bit into it). As a New Yorker, it pains me to $5 for a Slice of pizza that tastes bad. The cashier, Abigail, rang me up a \"Bronx\" slice which is $5.49 because it has pepperoni. I told her she ran me up wrong and she said they are all the same price. I told her the classic was $4.99 according to their menu. She argued it wasn't. Then the manager comes over to void and she rang me up properly. Oh and I couldn't even buy a soda because they were warm. So to recap: warm soda, cold pizza, less than desirable cashier."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? This is the worst pizza I've ever had. I've given them two chances and they did not fail to disappoint either time.  First time I tried the sausage: two pieces of sausage on the slice, soggy, tasteless pizza.  Today, and it was the last straw- the Buffalo chicken. Again, soggy and absolutely NO Buffalo sauce! They may be cheap and fairly fast, but do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere."}
