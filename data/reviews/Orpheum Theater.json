{"text":"I just had my wedding at the Orpheum Theatre. I never imagined that I would get married there until I randomly wandered in after looking at the Overture Center for my wedding and determining it was too stuffy. The Orpheum was such a cool and beautiful venue. I have to say that everything came together perfectly in the end, and I could not have been happier on my big day. That being said, I have to say that the journey was hard. The event coordinator was not a great communicator, and I frankly think it is because he needs an assistant or partner because he is too overloaded. At times, he did not answer our calls when we had pre-scheduled conference calls, did not return calls, or emails. He gave conflicting information on several occasions, including price quotes. 

I was planning my wedding from out of state, and I did not feel like it was all coming together until approximately the week before my wedding. As a highly organized person, it drove me crazy and made me feel like I lacked all control at times. (I admit this is a personality flaw more than the fault of the venue.) At one point, the coordinator told me that I could have whatever I wanted and then he kept telling me I could not do things I wanted to do or would charge me an arm and a leg to do what I wanted. I felt like he talked out of both sides of his mouth. Our wedding was exactly what I wanted, but I paid for every last tealight candle. I have some of the best memories ever from this unique and wonderful venue, and the coordinator was personally responsible for making my vision happen. 

The food was fantastic. It all came out hot, at the same time, and cooked perfectly.They pulled off an appetizer that we ripped off from the Tornado Room perfectly. Everyone raved about the food and location. The lighting is a bit tough for photos, and the acoustics are hard for music, but if you are prepared and get professional vendors, it is not a problem. Because the venue is non-traditional, you have to be willing to sacrifice some things to have your wedding here, but it is so worth it. People continue to compliment me for doing something so different and special, and I am so glad I had my wedding there in the end."}
{"text":"I would visit here every time I visited Madison - my husband and I almost went twice in one weekend - we liked it that much (we would have gone again if another movie we hadn't already seen had been playing). We saw THE SIMPSONS MOVIE on opening night. The movie was great (that is for another thread), but what made it even more fun was the Simpsons-themed snacks being sold and the SIMPSONS clips being played while we were waiting for the film to begin. The employees were really nice, too - just like with the restaurant, this place is 'cool' without being pretentious. Get dinner around 6:30 and see a movie at 8 - it's the perfect night. :)"}
{"text":"We came for the happy hour, which we'd heard good things about.  You can get rail drinks for $3.00 and they put out a nice spread of snacks - a few types of cheeses, chicken wings, and mussels.  The chicken wings had a really good sweet and sour flavor, and were quite large.  Not much like your usual buffalo wings.  The mussels were very delicious, prepared with parsley, bread crumb, shallots, and wine.  Perfectly cooked too.  Quite impressive for bar snacks.  My only bitch about them was that they were gritty - but hey, it was free, right?  

Other complaints

1.  Outdoor seating is extremely limited.  We had to sit inside, and it's sort of cavernous and creepy in there

2.  The girl who was waiting on us was really awful.  She apparently didn't know the difference between a tonic and coke (she brought us brown drinks and insisted they were gin and tonics), she spilled a drink on me, and she knocked into me while I was walking to the bathroom, spilling some other tables half eaten chicken wings and mussels all over me.  I'm sure she was new, but you really shouldn't hire someone to work at a bar who doesn't know basic things like what coke is and what tonic is."}
{"text":"LOVE happy hour at the Orpheum.  The martini's are all great (except the Bardot) and cheap (only $5 each at happy hour).  My favorite is the strawberry martini.  The watermelon is great too, but they have run out of watermelon twice . . . so order this one early.  

Yummy snacks are also provided.  These usually include cheese & crackers, steamed muscles, fried calamari and/or chicken wings.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch. One of the best I have ever had. Have been to a couple concerts here and loved every minute. We almost got married here but then they had the fire.

I love this place"}
{"text":"The absolute worst venue I've ever been to for a show. Way too much base for the Cherub/Hippie Sabatoge show, I couldn't hear any words from the singers. I completely regret buying those tickets and driving 3 hours out of my way. The theater is too big for the shows put on. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love this venue! I have seen many shows here and I've never had a bad experience. The nostalgia of the building is unmatched and the staff is always friendly. I love that they host a variety of shows and they always make sure to have enough bars open to fulfill the drinking needs of Wisconsinites."}
{"text":"The Orpheum is an institution...a barn of an old theater.  Needs updated equipment, but at least its still here and still showing films.  A piece of Madison we can't afford to lose...since after loosing the Majestic, Esquire (and a long, long time ago, The Capitol), this is it as far as historic movie palaces go...enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Sorry, not lovin' Orpheum at the moment - bought the \"box\" seats and not impressed...  

We got seats three and four on our box, but since the seats aren't numbered, we're behind the folks that got there first - black shirts put us in the wrong box at first.  

So, pictures are worth their weight in gold - consider mental image of speakers and other blocked view - all for double the price..."}
{"text":"Counting crows 12/13/14, was an absolutely amazing show!! No bad seat in the house. The closest place to get drinks was a cash only bar, wish it would have been a card bar as well. Overall, great time!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, historic space in a glorious city on a poppin' street.  Was here from Philly for a wedding and boy was it worth the 18 hr drive!  We danced all night! The food was eh, staff was friendly...especially the guy with the curious mustache that danced with the party on his was out ;)"}
{"text":"I would have given it five stars, but I didn't much care for the way some of the seating, etc. was handled. First I was told there were no seats up front and that the VIP seats were in Balcony C. When I arrived, I was told they put seats on the floor up front but I could sit in Balcony C still if I wanted. I was not told, however, that all the other people sitting where I was sitting got their tix for $65 (as opposed to my $150). I did get a bunch of VIP stuff, too, but didn't care about the swag, just the seat. Had I been given the option, I would have paid $65 for the Gold Circle like those around me and foregone the swag. I saw the same show at another venue and they handled it much more professionally and I got what I paid for, as did those sitting nearby me. I don't know if I would return to the Orpheum, even though it is a very pretty venue and the sound was good, considering the guys cranked their sound a bit louder than they should have."}
{"text":"I love seeing live music in old theaters like this. I like that its all seating. I didn't mind standing shoulder-to-shoulder with people for three hours at shows when I was in high school, but now I'd much rather sit.

On the negative side, I think the stage setup is awkward. It's really high up, like halfway between the floor and the balcony. If you're on the floor, you're looking up the whole time, and if you're in the front of the balcony, you're practically looking at the tops of all the performers heads."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but they make it very hard.  I've had several bad experiences here but yet I continue to try supporting them and I keep getting disappointed in the end.  This is the last theatre downtown but unless something changes with the management I can't imagine it will be around for much longer, despite all the 4 and 5 star reviews that is has received which you'll notice all relate to the bar and/or restaurant.  
Here is a short summary of my most recent experience.  I went to see a movie with friends.  They had the standard playtime's for the movie, they took my money and no one warned me about anything else that would be going on that night.   Not even mid-way through the movie some loud music starts up which is followed shortly by screaming and shouting.  They were having a party in the lobby!  I couldn't even hear parts of the movie due to how loud the music was.   I came in through the front door and I would have liked to exit through the front door but it was blocked off because of the party.  I told the bouncer, yes I said bouncer, that I wanted to talk to a manager because I'd like a refund.  It took a while and the consensus was that no one from the box office was around so I couldn't get a refund but I was given two free passes for next time, in fact everyone in the theatre that night complained and got free passes.  If you have to give out triple the amount of passes that you received money for you aren't exactly coming out ahead.  The only thing that moved this one star experience to two stars was the fact that when I returned the next day the manager of the box office listened and agreed it was both a shame and a poorly scheduled disaster plus my friend and I both got our refunds in the end.  I wish I could say this whole fiasco was a surprise but it's actually status quo for The Orpheum.  I'd hardly even call this place a theatre any more, they haven't even replaced the projection bulb in the Stage Door and probably won't until the Wisconsin Film Festival rolls around.  They don't show nearly as many independent films as they used to and in my opinion they miss a lot of potential revenue by not having any matinee showings.  I would gladly pay the normal ticket price to see some classic & foreign movies during the day but instead this place has become nothing more than a brunch spot.  It's a sad state of affairs for this lovely and historic theatre.   Cinema gets much more respect from respect over at the UW Cinematheque and those showings are free!"}
{"text":"Saw The 1975 here in May. First off, love the location right on State Street with an awesome view of the Capitol building. The show was on a Saturday night, but was still able to find parking available in a garage just a few blocks away which was nice. 

The venue is very nice. They had a pretty good system in which they handed out different wristbands for who can and can't drink, whether they're underage or designated driver. They handed those out while you waited to get in to the building. I chose to watch the show in the balcony and wasn't disappointed. The venue is beautiful, and you have an awesome view of everything from there. The show was sold out, yet there was still plenty of space open in the balcony, so you could move around and find the perfect spot without any trouble. I could also feel a gentle breeze of what I assume was a ventilation system, which makes for an added bonus. Most importantly, the sound in the venue is great. Definitely a great place to see some live music."}
{"text":"You know you're old when you get excited that a concert venue has seats.

That's right you heard me, you can have a place to sit during your concert!

General admission is usually $25 plus taxes and fees. The beer selections are $7-9 for 16 oz tall boys. They also had regular 12 oz beer on social for $5. They sell snacks too, popcorn, pizza, and chips which is convenient. 

Oh and they accept credit cards. 

The bathrooms are clean and in impressive shape considering how old this venue is."}
{"text":"Got kicked out of the last show I attended for being \"unreasonable\". I'm not sure exactly what \"unreasonable\" entailed because I can assure you that I was being reasonable. Not even the bouncers that escorted me out knew what I did to warrant temporary banishment. Apparently an unidentified person of authority commanded to \"throw out that man because he is being unreasonable\". I used a calm and reasonable manner to convince the bouncer to grant me re-entry. The bouncer could see that I indeed was being reasonable, and agreed that this was a misunderstanding. The bouncer went inside and asked the unidentified person of authority if I could re-enter. Despite his efforts, the unidentified person of authority would not allow me to come back in. 

Sweet venue though, fair drink prices. I am giving a 2 star review because I had fun, which is what a reasonable person would do."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Orpheum theater because of it's rich Madison history and it's importance there!. It is a nice establishment with a warming sense when you go there. I have been here twice for 2 concerts and they were OK. The most recent one was for Rusko which was spectacular. The older-style seats, floor, and stage with a couple of nice modern things thrown in to give it an updated feel. They have a second upper level which is sort of oddly proportioned and designed. It almost goes straight up so that people on the second level can have a view of the stage but it is very steep. So if you are intoxicated, I suggest staying on the first level... Furthermore the bar and drinks here are actually better priced than most concert places... It was $4 for a 16oz PBR which ya... It's PBR but for $4? Can't go wrong! The acoustics are pretty good but could be better because sound doesn't carry well in there for some reason. Also the bathrooms in the basement are absolutely disgusting and for some reason they always allow girls to come into the men's room if the women's is full... I think that is highly inappropriate and there needs to be new management or staff to help solidify that problem. Finally, people who attend this place are extremely rude, intoxicated or not they just flat out are."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a show, although i've noticed it can get stifling in here sometimes.  the AC must be on the fritz (or non-existant).  I like this as a small venue for a wide range of different acts.  I've seen comedy, jam and electro shows here.  Keep up the good work, Orpheum!"}
{"text":"What an unbelievable place to hold a wedding.

Our friends had their wedding here and it was incredible.  The food, the decor, everything was spectacular. 

The staff there was really friendly and helpful, and the place has such a special atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beautiful historic building! This was our first time being at the Orpheum Theater and we were very pleased with our experience. We were there to see a concert that Billy Currington was preforming. Was not sure how it was going to sound but the acoustics sounded great. We were able to sit where ever we liked which was nice. There was also good access to restrooms and the bar :) I would recommend to anyone that loves old historic buildings to go to the Orpheum if they get a change. I have also heard from several people that this is a fabulous wedding venue!"}
{"text":"Like many other Yelpers I'm sure, I am a true devotee of the old-timey theaters; from single-screen neighborhood movie houses to the opulent grand palace theaters with their customized neon signs and ornate interior decor.  This one's a true classic in downtown Madison, although they could update the sound system."}
{"text":"Although my boyfriend and I had standing room in the back of the ground floor, we were able to see the Bangles who rocked the house down! The acoustics were clear and I didn't need to crane my neck (even though I'm only 5'3''). Nor were my ears buzzing from the sound being too loud. So kudos galore to the set up of this theatre.

The second time I went, the lobby had turned into a place for dancing. This transformed the theatre into an entirely different yet fun atmosphere. I had the best martini of my life, as it was strawberry flavored, actually had fresh pieces of of strawberry in it, sweet, not too strong, and easy to gulp down."}
{"text":"Just saw Kip Moore play here what an awesome venue!"}
{"text":"Came to see a drag show and the show qas amazing, but the staff... not so much. When I came in the woman with long brown hair working at the counter was immediatley rude to me and when i was showing her my tickets she roed her eyes at me conttinously and was extremely disrespectful, saying things like, 'why would I care', 'Are you kidding me right now, Ridiculous' and  'why am I even helping you people this is pointless' The whole time I felt very uncomftorable and uneasy around her. When my friend and I moved on to the next guy to get our wristbands, he talked very quietly so i couldnt hear what he was saying. I repeated what a couple times until he grabbed my wrist and ripped it across the counter and yelled I SAID YOUR WRIST PLEASE. My hand and wrist hurt for the rest of the night. After that the show was amazing and the staff that came along from the tour was great, but after being yelled at disrespected, this venue is at the bottom of my list."}
{"text":"Few places in Madison are as versatile and, perhaps for that reason, central as the Orpheum Theater is in this city. Its iconic sign imposes the theater's presence on State Street, reminding you that you're walking in to a piece of local history. 

This is where I came to see the legendary Noam Chomsky give a speech to a full auditorium - one that comes complete with massive red curtains, indoor balconies, and intricate golden carvings. This is the place where I've seen some of the most brilliant indie and foreign films that I never would have known about otherwise. And at $11 for 2 people, this place gives me the best value for my money that I could ever spend on a date.

It's wise to start or finish a movie here with a stop at their bar, where the bartender makes some of the best cocktails in town. The whole experience just exudes classiness, without the ridiculous costs that are usually associated with a place like this. The same applies to the restaurant they run at various times throughout the day, and while the food looks excellent, I've never had the opportunity to try it. I hope to fix that soon."}
{"text":"Coming from Boston, I'm used to amazing music venues with the greatest and best bands.

The Orpheum Theater definitely lives up to my expectations. It may not offer the biggest names, but biggest doesn't always equate to best. 

Due to the smaller venue, the performers usually have something to prove, and end up putting on an amazing show.

I've been here a couple of times, from concerts to themed-dance nights, and have had nothing but an amazing time.

If you can look past the overly bro-y crowd and sorority-esque girls, and just focus on the music, you will have a great time."}
{"text":"I've seen a few shows here and always have a good time. Drinks are not absurdly overpriced and I've never had a problem getting as close to the stage as I want. Overall, a solid place to see a show."}
{"text":"Come early for concerts to get best seats.  Not sure if it was a one time issue, but we went on a hot night and there wasn't any air conditioning."}
{"text":"I went to the Orpheum for my first concert in nearly 15 years! I saw 311 at the Orpheum on October 15, 2017, and had a great time. This is a nice venue.

Pros:
- Unique, cool, vintage space. Simply walking around and admiring the decor is fun.
- Great location with a very short walk to parking garages. We parked in the Overture Center garage. Turn a corner, walk a block, and there you are. Bam!
- Friendly and attentive staff and bartenders.
- Bars galore! No one will be thirsty since there are multiple bars on every level -- even bars within the general admission/pit area in front of the stage. When you want to get a drink, you won't miss any of the concert. 
- Attentive event staff people manning the crowd. I draped my jacket on a barricade by the stage but later tied the jacket around my waist. Once I put it around my waist, one of the crowd management guys asked if my jacket had been on the barricade since he thought someone had taken it. I appreciated that the event staff went beyond watching for people causing trouble -- they were also watching people's belongings.

Cons:
- While the building is antique and ornate, parts of it seem worn and grubby. Examples: Chandelier lights out and/or bulbs missing, red carpet on stairs is nearly black in high-traffic areas, and some paint chip spots on the walls.
- Women's lower-level bathroom was not well stocked with soap. I went to the bathroom during the first half of the (not sold out) show, and every single soap dispenser at that point was completely empty.
- Acoustics are a little iffy. From the balcony, I had a hard time deciphering Nick's lyrics. Once I moved downstairs to the GA/pit area, his voice seemed clearer.

My decision to return really depends on the headliner, but I'll gladly return to the Orpheum when another one of my favorite bands has a concert there!"}
{"text":"The only place to regularly see movies downtown now, they have an interesting array of independent and mainstream movies in a fun atmosphere- great for a date or a fun start to a night out with friends. Even more importantly, the happy hour is great- delicious and unique martinis for only $5, plus a free buffet of cheese and crackers, mussels, and more- outside on State Street in the summer/fall and inside the interesting theater entryway in the winter...what could be better?"}
{"text":"Better for movies than for live performances. I saw Ben Folds here a few years back and the acoustics just weren't up to snuff. The seats were old and squeaky, the rugs tattered. Overall the whole place looked like it needed some love.

This theater is good for watching movies, and has a lot of old school charm, really the only true old time theater in Madison. Unfortunately, now that the facade of the theater faces a blank, featureless wall that comprises part of the monstrosity that is the Overture Center, the effect of its design is diminished considerably."}
{"text":"Went to see Patton Oswalt on 1-14-15..easy parking in the ramp that is almost next door, staff was very friendly. Only complaint is that the seating is so cramped that it is really uncomfortable, if I were 5 1/2 feet tall and less than 120 lbs. it would have been fine. Also, arrived at 7:10 for an 8 oclock show.. so what do people do when they arrive that early and nothing to do while waiting? Cell phone of course, not talking or texting, just playing a little free cell to kill time. Usher came over and told us no cell phones allowed! Place was still pretty empty at that point and people were milling around talking, drinking etc. but no free cell? Struck me as pretty stupid..definitely not my favorite venue to see a show .. mostly because of the awful seating"}
{"text":"Decent place to see a show.  The acoustics seemed to be ok, the seats - well, after taking a look at them you might prefer standing instead.

The venue got to be pretty warm - on a spring night, it must have gotten up to about 85-90 inside.  The show we went to wasn't sold out, but it seemed overly crowded down by the stage. 

Overall I've seen a few shows here over the years, and I try to save this venue for artists I \"really\" want to see.  If you're coming in from another city, just be prepared to deal with the chotch factor (i.e. dirty hippies and drunken frat boys) and you'll make out a-ok.

Also - side tip - there is a parking ramp a few blocks over, and it's only $5.00 to park for a few hours (after business hours).  It was a good deal, not to have to park out on the street."}
{"text":"Knocking this down a star, because now that I've been there a few times, I keep coming back less impressed.  A few of my issues:

1) Long lines at the will-call booth.  They should have a better system down.
2) Poor sound quality. (I recognize this can be the band's fault as well).
3) Lack of water fountains.

Hopefully some improvements can be made in the future."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Orpheum for decades and had my first visit there since the current owners took over. After mulling over my visit for a few days, I'm not at all happy with the way the venue is run, specifically security. 

Security was odd from the start. You weren't allowed to line up anywhere near the doors unless you had VIP tickets. Everyone else was moved a half block away around the corner from Noodles. 

Once inside the security staff was rather rude and had a very intensive screening; it was worse that most TSA encounters I've had. Instead of a quick peek in my purse which is normal at a venue like this the guard made me take out most of my stuff and rummaged around every pocket. I was also harassed because I had a sun glasses case in my purse. He was convinced I was bring in a container and not glasses. 

The worst part of my visit was the rest rooms. I went downstairs to use the restroom and was followed by one of the security staff. He proceeded to wait outside the woman's restroom until I was done and went back upstairs. The same thing happened to my wife when she used the restroom. It was very creepy and unsettling. 

I can't say I'll every go back. The level of security and rude staff is not worth any show they could possible get."}
{"text":"The Orpheum Theater is fantastic.  In addition to the ornate decor, how great is it that the curtain actually rises when the movie starts??  They have a bar in the lobby, which is nice for relaxing before or after the movie.  They have a nice mix of blockbuster-mega-hits, indie movies, and b-movies.  This is an institution that I hope never goes under."}
{"text":"\"Do you buy all these books retail or do you send away for, like, a shrink kit that comes with all these volumes included? \" - Will, Good Will Hunting.

How long has it been since I was in the Orpheum, well I was watching Good Will Hunting, so awhile.   This is less a review and more a memory of the greatness the Orpheum possesses for me.

Back when the Orpheum was nothing but a movie theater you could not watch films from the balcony, sure the ushers went up there but regular ticket paying folk were not permitted.   While I never got an official answer the generally gossiped conclusion was that if it was regularly filled with people the old structure would collapse and most likely kill the unsuspecting audience below... lesson 1 in the Orpheum I never intended to sit under or too close to the balcony.

This lack of permission did not, however, stop my then bf from insisting that we hop the velvet rope and sit in the balcony.  Making the big desicion to break social norms by crossing that rope is one of my first memories of dong something I was afraid of because I was trying to be a cool teenager.  As a result Good Will Hunting, balcony movies, and the Orpheum remain key developmental memories."}
{"text":"Although I love the ambience of this venue, our last experience prior to the doors being open was quite insulting. We arrived at the time doors were to be open at 7pm. It was raining and we were told we needed to form a line a block away by Noodles and Company. There were several male workers that continued to shove us away from the front doors because they did not want us to stand and wait there. There was a woman (dressed scantily clad, I may add) that seemed to be in charge of telling the men to shoo us away. The men walked us down to Noodles and Co twice, but we refused to stand in the middle of the sidewalk for no reason so we ended up standing around sidewalk benches, which are public property.  We waited in the rain for 30 minutes and kept being told to move a block away so that we wouldn't block the businesses. All of the businesses closed at or prior to 7pm. There were only about 15-20 of us, and when I asked one of the nicer gentlemen why we couldn't just wait by the doors he answered \"That's a damn good question that I wish I had an answer for\". So, even they thought the request was ridiculous.
Other than that, the facility is beautiful and the staff inside were friendly."}
{"text":"We love the Orpheum for it's antique atmosphere and grand size but it still need a lot of work.  Many of the seats are broken and need updating and much of the interior needs work.  I know it is nice but it could be a lot lot better with some money and restoration.   Please fix this place up to be what it could be."}
{"text":"I've been in Madison for years and I finally dined at the Orpheum! On Friday nights they have all you can eat fish fry, and I must say I was impressed. They served Canadian bluegill with potatoes, coleslaw, and a very tasty tartar sauce. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. The only thing missing was table linens.

I've also attended live music venues and parties hosted in the lobby of the Orpheum, both of which I've enjoyed. The Orpheum lobby is a great space to host a party. The high ceilings give it a very spacious feel, even when it gets a bit crowded."}
{"text":"Came here to see Wanda Sykes yesterday. I do not have a whole lot to say. The weather wasn't too cold out that night but the inside of the theatre was. And our seats were very tight, very little leg room. After sitting for awhile during the show I became very uncomfortable and had to get up and walk around. The bathrooms are downstairs and there was no door to the women's bathroom. Everyone coming down the stairs can see into the sink area. 
The drink prices were very high; a can of basic beer was about $6-7.
A speciality drink like a hurricane was $10 each."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here, in the Orpheum's outdoor cafe seating, after Farmer's Market. The eggs benedict was very nicely done. We were seated quickly, but service was a little spotty, and our food took a bit longer to arrive than we might have liked. It was such a delight to sit out on State and people-watch after Farmer's Market let out.

Their breakfast cocktail menu was very tasty."}
{"text":"It's too bad such a beautiful, historic building fell into the hands of such terrible people. 

Eric Fleming extorted myself and my husband for $1500 on a wedding that never happened, and they knew FULL WELL that they wouldn't even have a liquor license at the time that our wedding was supposed to take place (late October 2011, but of course they never told us about that tiny detail) - when we heard inklings that bad stuff was going down, we cancelled even though we hadn't even put a deposit down yet. 

They harassed us and verbally abused us for the $1500 deposit to be paid to them until we felt we had no choice. They said they were going to sue us. What a bunch of crap - KARMA IS A BITCH!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars as it is one of my old time favorite venue in Madison. Their location is superb and the feeling you get that you are transported to a different area. The theater still maintains it's original charm.

I've attended many different events and I am always surprised on how well it can transform, from concerts, to movie premieres, shows and others.
I like that it doesn't feel huge although a lot of people fit. Sounds is one of their biggest issues, depending on where you are you hear a lot of echo. On the flip side you can see the stage from almost every angle.

Their staff is always very friendly and helpful. And their ladies bathroom have finally updated stalls! Yay!"}
{"text":"I've heard this called the Last of the Great Theaters in downtown Madison. No, sorry to say it's now the LAST THEATER in downtown Madison, and fellow isthmusites should take great care to gather a posse and go there often, for lunch, dinner, drinks, movies or just popcorn, because I'll be damned if I'm going to watch this place close down due to lack of business. This is the kind of grand old theatre that still has the wee balconies just off either side of the stage --the kind that makes you want to point and shout \"Mr. Lincoln! Behind you!\" with the hopes one of your friends will shoot soda out his nose because you're so witty. This is the place I saw a guy in an amazingly authentic Batman costume kung-fu his way through an elaborately staged bout with some of Penguin's thugs onstage for pre-show entertainment at the Batman premier -only to anounce afterwards in a squeaky, pubescent voice that the show would start soon. The sold-out crowd, after a minute of stunned silence and clearly offended by this teenage imposter, pelted him with concessions. The Orpheum is a rare and beautiful theater, and despite the faults that come with age (sound, seat comfort) you should make a point to become a regular there. An old-school movie-watching experience beckons you! This is a great place to see films (big and small) and even concerts. Their popcorn is pretty amazing, too. No lie. (It's the oil.) Now go there!"}
{"text":"Since the vibe can change from day to day, I'll keep this one simple: 

+ A gorgeous new marquee on a theater that's kept most of its original charm
+ Updated stalls in the ladies' room - thank you, thank you, thank you
+ Doesn't feel huge despite being one of the largest concert spaces downtown
+ I am short but I can see from back by the sound board or in the lower-level seats; I'm no longer banished to the balcony or forced to push up to the very front
- Unreliable sound; it often echos or is just is a bit off - I've actually witnessed a band mocking it from the stage, asking if the sound person is effing with them and wondering what they did to make him so mad

Bonus points: the gig posters as of late have been beautiful, adding that extra bit of loveliness to the building's facade when you walk by."}
{"text":"Executive Summary: good venue for music/performances downtown.  Alcohol available on site.  Restrooms are tucked away in the basement and are on the small side but are clean and in decent repair.  As with everywhere downtown, plan to park in a nearby ramp and walk to the venue.

I visited the Orpheum for the first time in February for the Postmodern Juke Box show.  Great show, good venue.  We were on the lower level towards the back.  Visibility was good from our seats.  Acoustics were good as well.  For an older venue accessibility to these seats was decent.  One of our group members walks with a cane and she was able to navigate the main aisles just fine.  The stairs to the upper level and down to the lower level restrooms are more of a challenge.  I didn't notice if they had elevator access for those with limited mobility.  Something I'll watch for next time.  Although given the historic age of the building I wouldn't be surprised if such services are not available.

I did not partake of a beverage but they had a main bar as you walk in the entrance and two side bars inside the actual auditorium on ground level.  I didn't explore the upper levels so not sure what beverage opportunities exist above ground floor.  Seems like drinks were mostly in the $10 and up range.  A bit pricey maybe but you're paying for the convenience of a bar at a theater/performance venue so not unexpected.

Restrooms are located downstairs and are a little tight, as I would expect in a building this age.  They were clean and in decent repair though so they're doing the best they can."}
{"text":"Madison has 3 fantastic venues, and this is one of them. Have seen some great shows here, and its easy to get right up close, or sit back in the seats. really nice either way.

They lose one star for overpriced booze."}
{"text":"Got free tics while walking down state street on st. Paddys day for a band called \"walk off the earth\". I believe thats kyrie Irvings favorite band (he thinks the earth is flat).  I digress. 
Place is old and kinda run down. Band was ok. Free made them even better. 
Wouldn't pay top dollar to see a band here but im spoiled living in the 414 with all the amazing venues but hey, free is free so its all good Orpheum"}
{"text":"Love the Orpheum!

Went to see Flogging Molly here.

Great show.

Asked an usher why I w asnt able to purchase tickets in the front center balcony area.

He says it was a website error.

He upgraded me to the seats I wanted for Free!

Great customer service!

Every bartender there has been awesome!

Highly recommend going to see a show you love at this location!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SITTING AT CONCERTS.

I think it's part of the contract of being in my twenties that I'm supposed to enjoy standing in a mosh pit five feet from the stage. 'Cuz everyone likes getting sprayed with the lead singer's sweat, right? Well, I love sitting at concerts and am instantly fond of any venue that has the option to stand up close and personal or sit and soak up some tunes from afar. As Steve said, not a bad seat in the place. One of my favorite venues!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Lobby Nights. The music was dubstep which is easy to dance to so I enjoyed that aspect. But when it first started it was $3 and you would get a free bottle of water....then the bar started to charge for water.  Da f...? It was a young crowd and it's hot and sweaty and water is necessary. I hope Lobby Nights comes back."}
{"text":"Umphrey's 2,000th show!

Not a bad venue at all, the sound was good and the security was cool. They have a place next door making taffy apples but of course we ran late both nights and couldn't grab any.

Reasonable parking garage a block away beats crappy Madison street parking."}
{"text":"Nowhere else have I ever had such intimiate concert experiences... like being so close to Jason Mraz I could have touched him (which I admit I kinda wanted to back then...) and being in the thick of the tradish ping-pong ball bombardment during Guster's \"Airport Song.\"  Because the Orpheum is small, I also had the killer chance to hang out in the lobby after Guster's show, and with a few other devotees, met and got autographs from the band.  Can't do this at the United Center, folks.  This place needs to be carefully preserved and cherished - its vintage cool at its best."}
{"text":"This is a go to spot for concerts, stand ups, and other special events.  The building is old.  The bathrooms are easily messed up so go early versus later.  

Drinks are expensive but sometimes they have deals (like for Flogging Molly they had a shot of whiskey and a beer for a slightly better price than just a beer or just a shot.)

Seats are pretty comfortable on the main floor.  A little tighter in the balcony.  But the sightlines are good at any spot in the venue."}
{"text":"The theater itself is very old and classic inside.The balcony view is amazing. The people who work at Orpheum are very nice. I was not sure why they did a \"Early entry\" line for people for an extra fee. There was no indication of Early entry access to the venue on the website to buy tickets. That was really not cool of the venue. So there were 2 separate lines. I don't know why they allow crowd surfing too, which is dangerous. The security said they can't stop it from happening. That is a negative about this place. I had to be pulled out of the pit because the shoving and pushing was crushing me. The security does not do much at this venue."}
{"text":"I went to the Orpheum this past Saturday to see the Avett Bros and damn was the show incredible. The theater is incredibly beautiful and historic. The venue was large enough for my dad and aunt to sit in the balcony with a great view and for my cousins, sisters and I to dance in the FRONT ROW of the pit! My complaint is that there isn't a coat check; we're in Wisconsin people... Regardless, the theater seems to have come into much better hands and I hope to see more shows in the future"}
{"text":"My second time at the Orpheum and overall I have had good experiences. I have only been here for music concerts. The outside/inside is pretty classy/they are known for their big sign on the front state street entrance. Once inside, security is very thorough- but I would rather have them more thorough that not! There are many bars on different levels. Alcohol is pricey, but no more pricey then any other type of venue. They will usually fill up your water bottle for free after you purchase the first bottle. 

The inside is pretty neat from the old chandeliers and curtains- very old school and vintage looking. The music was loud and the video on the projector screen during the concert was clear/easy to see. The general admission is usually set up so that there is a large open area in front of the stage for standing. There are plenty of seats in the back or in the balcony to sit if you would like. The hallways to exit are pretty narrow, which can get to be pretty loud/hot/packed as everyone is trying to exit, but it is usually is pretty quick to leave. There is a merchandise table usually up front, and there is a coat check as well."}
{"text":"It's hard to imagine that the corporate buyout of the previously locally owned theater didn't have a negative impact on the business and having been to a few shows recently, it does seem like there's a lack of charm now.

My biggest complaint is the exorbitant price of alcohol at the venue. There weren't any drinks under $8 a piece, even beer! I get the concept of marking prices up because you can't bring drinks in, but for Madison standards, that is RIDICULOUS. The most recent time I was there, I opted not to drink because of it, but next time I'll make sure to have my drinks elsewhere (before the concert) if it's that kind of night.

Otherwise, Orpheum is a pretty standard venue for events and concerts. They have both seats and room in front of the stage for standing, but at the events I've been to, they've chosen one method of the other for the entire venue. For general admission shows, that usually results in tons of empty seats because everyone wants to stand. Alternatively, if GA was an option but sold out, I think I would skip buying tickets altogether (unless it was an artist I really wanted to see).

I will say that Orpheum brings a lot of top names to Madison. There aren't many other venues in the area that do that other than Alliant Energy Center, so props to Orpheum. I'm sure I'll be back sometime soon, just not purchasing any booze from them."}
{"text":"Went to see The Avett Brothers last night, it was a good time.  I stood towards the back of the standing room area and could see the entire show.  My only complaint is that there wasn't a coat check.  In the middle of winter, everyone has a jacket with them, with is pretty inconvenient to either wear or hold for 2+ hours.  I guess I'm just used to having a coat check option at venues in the twin cities, that I didn't think about it.  I wouldn't wear a jacket next time."}
{"text":"Kate and I recently held our wedding at the Orpheum (ceremony and all) and it was fantastic. The service, the food, the setting were all something special. 

Hats off to an excellent event coordinator, a helpful bar staff and some very tasty scallops (even if I was too busy to actually eat one)."}
{"text":"The venue was breathtaking and the staff was amazing.  They were super respectful and I even overheard one of them say \"If someone looks dehydrated, just go ahead and give them a water\". I would love to return to this venue some day."}
{"text":"Went to see Rusko perform this weekend. Management was relaxed and they didn't overly search you upon entering the establishment.

Overall it was a fun time, there is seating in the back (and a pretty decent balcony that I didn't care to explore) - always a plus to have a place to take a break from dancing.

Clearly the crowd was bound to be sweaty, and jam packed with people (it's kind of expected when you go to these concerts, shouldn't come as a surprise). One negative point was that a fight broke out between two guys in the middle of the crowd, and there was no security to really stop it (the crowd ended up pulling them apart)."}
{"text":"It would be nice if they had a working phone number and website. :/ irritating to get any information."}
