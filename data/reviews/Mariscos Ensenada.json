{"text":"Absolutely love the Aguachile shrimp and the loaded oysters.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me to mariscos Ensenada. We ordered two dishes to share. The grilled chicken and fish combination was $10.95, chicken was fantastic! Best chicken I have ever had in restaurants! Sea food combination was $14.95, full of goodies. The food was delicious and amount was more than we two can handle. I would like come back to try other dishes, and I will recommend to my friends!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the family and I loved it! I think I heard something about new management because you can definitely tell.. The service was outstanding, very kind and friendly staff! The food was great as well. The portions are more plentiful now!! Will definitely be coming more often and recommending it to all my friends!"}
{"text":"always sure to stop by this place when im in town. Love the marlin and fish tacos. Tostada de ceveche are so light and refreshing on a hot day. Good beer selection too :)"}
{"text":"The \"Fish and shrimp Ensenada style\" plate is amazing and the fish and chips are simple and perfect. 
Whenever I am here it is pretty empty for some reason, but the waitress is very nice and quick, I think more people need to stop in!"}
{"text":"This place is yummmmmmmmy! there are a ton of mariscos place in the area but this by far my favorite! I suggest everyone to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Very good shrimp the ceviche is bomb everything is great but a lil pricy but worth it"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood spot for ceviche... though if you want oysters go to the spot at McDowell and 18th St... no idea what the name is."}
{"text":"I had the sea snail tostada, the octopus tostada, and two  scallop tacos. Oh wow! It was so good! I've never had Ensenada style before, now I know where to get good seafood. My fianc√© had the chimichanga mariachis. It was savory and creamy and delectable- I know- she made me try some. Never had snail before. It was friggin delish! Plenty of meat on those tostadas. Very generous portions. Great tortillas age salsa also. Attentive polite courteous service. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We opted for this place because of the 4.5 stars and the lengthy fish menu.  What an excellent option! The exterior is nondescript, almost missable (granted, it was dark).  The interior is basic, if not borderline hole-in-the-wall. The parking lot was practically empty, though it was early (6:15p).  The service was great - super patient and friendly (and efficient). The food was really good!  Incredibly fresh.  Between five of us we ordered: a camarones taco, a carne asada taco, pescado alcaparrado (fish filet with capers and garlic sauce), camarones fantasia (shrimp stuffed with cheese and jalepeno, wrapped in bacon), caldo de pollo con verduras (chicken soup with vegetables), and a kids quesadilla. The portions are huge (easily 2 to 3 meals, depending on one's appetite).  The fish, shrimp, and quesadilla all came with Spanish rice, simple salad (shredded iceburg, a couple slices of cucumber and tomatoes), and refried beans. The shrimp also came with fries.  The soup was so classic (\"just like grandma's\") with comforting broth and a lot of chicken (also split between two ppl and still huge bowls). The tacos were accompanied with this amazing creamy salsa verde and something like a chipotle mayo that were great on top of everything (not just tacos).  We all left completely stuffed and utterly satisfied (and still had food on our plates).  It didn't help that they provided complimentary chips and salsa.  

Highly recommend and would definitely seek them out next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"LOVE their ceviche!! Also best chips and salsa on 16th st. Try their fish tacos (you can order them grilled FYI)"}
{"text":"food was good quite a drive from our home , had the oysters they where good !! the shrimp cocktail was kind of funky tho it tasted like it had horse radish or something not your regular cocktail. tostadas de ceviche where good both fish and shrimp... for my babe and his mom they seemed to enjoy the michiladas they had . the juke box had the right music to sit and reminisce of family over all it was all good"}
{"text":"We were here for the fist time about 10 days ago and both really, really liked the entrees we each ordered---Fried Shrimp and the other was Chicken Mole.  We are going to return today and each have the dish the other ordered last time.  The flan dessert was really fabulous and we will certainly have it again today.  In addition to wonderful food, our waitress, Elizabeth was totally charming and patient while assisting us to understand the menu.  One of the chefs came over to our table and was very welcoming too.  Great food and terrific staff made us want to become regulars.  This restaurant is a real treasure."}
{"text":"Food is ok.....I've tried better Marlin tacos so these where ok. My brother liked the fish tacos. Friendly service but not that clean. Salsa Verde and tortilla chips are good horchata was also good not too sweet or watered down. I give it a 3.5 stars :)"}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktail is enormous and so fresh tasting.  The michaladas were so refreshing.  Highly recommend the one on 16th street between McDowell and Thomas.  Delicious"}
{"text":"Pescado Relleno De Jaiva a La Crema and Chile Rellenos for delivery last night. Both were amazing...best rellenos I've ever eaten. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just came to Phoenix for business and found this on Yelp on our way home. We went in and gave it a try because of good reviews on here. Chips and salsa is good. Chips are fresh and crispy. salsa not spicy at all and has a hint of chipotle to it. I ordered shrimp tacos with rice and beans. That was good and just right. Hubby ordered a whole tilapia fish plate. He was happy. They have a variety of seafood in their menu and many to chose from. Overall, good experience. The food server was pleasant and attentive. She had a good personality and nice smile. We claimed our free dessert from yelp. The flan was good. Just right and not too sweet. This is a recommended place. Pls stop by and you will enjoy too!!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with great selections. On the search for fish tacos this restaurant came up with rave reviews and boy were they spot on. Being the klutz that I am, I spilled salsa all over my plate (and pants) and our server came over right away and replaced my plate (which was more than half way done). A+ for hospitality!

They offer a wide selection of Mexican seafood to keep you satisfied. Our server recommend shrimp ceviche and just do yourself a favor-and order it. It was delicious. 

My fish and shrimp tacos were yummy, but I was expecting a more flavor or kick. I had to drown these bad boys in salsa to add something more to it. However, that shrimp ceviche and churro dessert- amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here & the service was fast & employees were nice & friendly..seafood is fresh & the best I have tasted in a long time..this is the place to be..not to mention the atmosphere, the music is Cambia & it's awesome!!"}
{"text":"Its not a bad spot for Mexican ceviche along with other seafood plates. The menu offers a lot of options, the service is quick and friendly.  A no frills place but it does deliver. I ordered The pulpo  tostada along with the shrimp . Fresh ingredients with several hot sauce options.  The appetizer was my favorite part of dinner, it was the Toritos Rellenos ( Stuffed chili with cheese cream and shrimp) wrapped in Bacon.  The one star missing was for the mixed seafood cocktail which lacked in the sauce it sat in, not enough flavor. It's a quiet relaxed atmosphere.  Will return for the Toritos Rellenos for sure."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were very good, and were only $7 for   
3. The fish and vegetables were also very enjoyable. We also liked the friendly people and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had amazing food there. The fish tacos, shrimp tacos and the tostada emprezada they were so good. I cannot wait until the next time we are. The micheladas were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great ceviche tostadas and fish tacos. One of the best in the city."}
{"text":"Just delicious.  Spotlessly clean.  Fresh fish.  The service was a tiny bit slow but when the food came out, I knew why!  They were making it to order.  I went a little loose cannon and ordered the smoked marlin tacos!  They were amazing.  The rice and beans were spot on authentic and delicious.
Do yourself a favor and head on over."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  I recommend the fish tacos and ceviche tostadas.  The micheladas are just okay.  The building is pretty foul.  Kinda looks like a barred up shack that most people wouldn't want to eat at.  But if you are adventurous it is worth the risk.  

If you are looking for good mariscos then I would go to the other side of the freeway and hit up Mariscos Playa Hermosa."}
{"text":"We stopped here later at night because Two Hippies Beach House was closed.  I'm glad we did, because the food was pretty decent.  I was a little nervous walking in because the whole place was empty, but that might have been because it was about to close (which we unfortunately didn't realize...so we left a generous tip ;) ).

My fiance asked, as he always does: \"what's good here?\"  The guy at the counter responded \"anything seafood!\"  Of course. It's not called Mariscos for nothin'.

So I ordered two shrimp tacos and one grilled marlin taco, since I'd never had marlin before.  All were delicious.  I didn't realize the shrimp in the tacos would be breaded, which I usually don't like, but it was pretty good.  The shrimp tasted good and juicy, and the toppings were nice (cabbage, pico de gallo, and cilantro).  The horchata seemed like it was homemade, and it was delicious.  The chips weren't the best, and they gave us a green salsa, which my fiance said would be too hot for me, so I didn't try it.

I took a look at their full menu while I was waiting for my food and they have a very decent selection.  We will definitely be back. Soon :)"}
{"text":"Descent fish tacos but their ceviche had fake lime juice( the bottled kind) those were only ok"}
{"text":"Actually tried to have lunch at La Santisma down the street but the place was packed. On a whim my friend and I came here. We were the only customers so we were a little concerned at first. The food, however, was excellent. I had a chicken burrito and my friend had the chicken mole. Great value too. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Warm chips and good salsa . Delicious fish tacos that only cost $2 ! Highly recommend the chipotle con crema camarones pasta. If you are really hungry get it with pasta ! Soooo good"}
{"text":"Was looking for the right Mariscos place to go to and hang with friends. Thank god I found this place, we visit weekly (especially when hungover). Great food! Service can be slow at times but the food is just too good !"}
{"text":"This place... so good. Ceviche is on point and the fish tacos are el bomb. Bonus points if you eat here hung over on a Sunday morning, watching soccer while you nurse yourself back to health over a few cervezas and some tasty treats."}
{"text":"1st time here, was recommended by reviews on @Calle16PHX instagram.  Love this street and the latin culture feel it has. Went in on a Sat. afternoon their service was pretty fast.  Had an appetizer of the Toritos, shrimp & fish tacos and tostada de agua chile (green) and a shrimp tostada.  A friend and I tried a little of each which we weren't disappointed and the Micheladas we're good! Plus a $15 gift certificate I had made it all worth it :) will definitelty come again."}
{"text":"Very very good seafood! After my workout this morning all I wanted was some good fish. Came here with my buddy and got a fish taco, a shrimp taco, and a scallop taco. Was filled off of just two! Scallop and fish were DELICIOUS and I'm taking the shrimp home. And their fish taco sauce is absolutely divine. Salsa is good, needed a little salt. And their cheesecake! Wow, decadent. Will definitely be back here again. Great prices too"}
{"text":"Came Here for the first time as I saw it had a five star review and it lived up to the review, i live in Chandler which is an hour drive from me but well worth the trip. I had the filet fish stuffed with shrimp and crab only over crema of chipotle sauce. I live in Chandler and I would drive out of my way again, the tostadas de ceviche were just average though."}
{"text":"I really hate giving bad reviews, but the seafood was terrible here.  You could tell we were eating old shrimp. The salmon was also old and had a super strong, fish odor.  Cost was too expensive. We paid $50 for two dinners one pop and one margarita.  The salsa was just ok.  The only thing that was good was the margarita, but I went there for seafood. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good traditional food! My only complaint was I didn't know the fish was super spicy with the chicken/fish combo. And make sure you try the churro dessert!"}
{"text":"Good seafood I had a campechana it had plenty of seafood my wife had aguachile she wasn't a big fan of it. But we order a ceviche tostado first and that was really good and fresh. I also order a chelada with a Tecate Light with extra salt it was good!"}
{"text":"Whenever I want some seafood that reminds me of my visits to Sinaloa I drop by Marisco's.  Good solid Mexican seafood served by the Mexicans who know how to make it."}
{"text":"We got the fried red snapper & ceviche tostadas. Fried red snapper was awesome, the ceviche tostadas  were also good, one more so than the other but that was just personal preference. They do the staples well, but it's the other items that fall short. The fries, the rice, the salad... Luckily those aren't the highlights of why we went, and what we did go for we thoroughly enjoyed. Service was nice and quick, she checked up on us and made sure we were set on anything we needed."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been amazing! They have something for everyone on their well-sized menu. To start, the chips and salsa are top notch. The salsa has flavors that I would get from my Nana's kitchen. But don't fill up on chips alone, the best is yet to come. My mom tried the grilled fish in a spicy yet creamy red sauce, the flavor was amazing. And she is a very tough critic to please. My favorite dish is Aguachile De Camar√≥n, do yourself a favor and ask for fresh avocado on top. This dish has such a perfect balance of flavor, heat, and acidity. It has that wonderful taste of the ocean without even a hint of fishiness. The addition of avocado is just a bonus and not necessary but it does add a silky almost sweet flair. I've eaten this elsewhere and it's always been lacking flavor in one area or another, but not here! It's so delicious that I find myself craving it the very next day and wanting go back. Paired with a Michelada, and you're set. It takes me back to eating Mariscos in Mexico overlooking the ocean. Just soo damn good!"}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of Mexican food because I grew up picky and then when I acquired a taste for it, my hubby burnt me out on it since it's his favorite kind. But everyone else trumped me tonight, so this is where we ended up. I was SO pleasantly surprised! The food is fresh and flavorful and delicious! The staff are very nice. I will be happy to come back here. The food even made me cry. ;) (it's a bit spicy but worth it)"}
{"text":"Love coming here for some fresh Mexican seafood. This place may look like a little hole in the wall but the food is always delicious and the portions are generous for the low price. The scallop tacos are among my favorites. I also like the mixta tostada, it has octopus and and shrimp. Lots of seafood cocktail options and ceviches as well! I wish they had a larger bar selection, but you can get beers, bloody Marys, micheladas and pina coladas so that's cool. Service is decent. They aren't over the top here, but they are friendly and do their job well. Typically there is only one server for the whole place during the day."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday. We got the Shrimp quesadilla which was packed full of shrimp! and the Paella which was really tasty and packed full of mussels, octopus, a crab leg.. Unexpectedly good. They also have Micheladas, which I love, though I'm glad that she clarified that it's made with Clamato, because I just want the lime juice, salt, and beer, so had them hold the clamato. They won best chips and salsa from the New Times in 2004, but I thought the chips as well as the fish taco I got tasted like the fryer oil needed to be changed out :("}
{"text":"The \"Green Ceviche\" was as green as it gets but the chef the making it clearly wasn't. It was fresh, flavorful, with just the right amount of tang vs spice, and was just overflowing with fish, scallops and shrimp. It came with a nice side of tostadas and when those were gone we enjoyed scraping the remains of the ceviche up using the thick cucumber slices that accompanied the dish, not just a decoration but actually fresh and crispy and good to eat! The service was very attentive, great margarita. We also tried the Marlin tacos, fish tacos and shrimp taco... I will say that it wasn't clear from the menu that everything except the smoked Marlin would be battered and fried. There was way too much frying going on.... wouldn't order those again but the ceviche really was a meal in itself."}
{"text":"The shrimp ceviche with avocado on top is delicious. Also had the shrimp taco which was good but nothing out of this world. Will definitely be back to try some more. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"The seafood is fresh and the plates are huge, the prices are fair. This is my go to spot for the hangover the next day and their so friendly there too. Plenty of room to sit down and eat or to take to go too."}
{"text":"The two cons for Mariscos Ensenada is the loud music (there is no escape in the dining room) and long wait to get paid and get out. 

That said, it's a quality mariscos experience. A little on the pricey side but, hey, I don't always need the cheapest seafood. Cleaning up the two items listed above, it was a fine experience. Food was good, service was friendly and fast, and the place was clean. Give it a try if you've got that Mariscos hankerin'."}
{"text":"The fish and shrimp tacos are amazing. This is my favorite for fish tacos and I eat here whenever I'm in the area. I love the sauce for the tacos as well. Great place at great prices."}
{"text":"The place is unassuming but the menu is extensive. We had the Camarones estilo cucaracha (Grilled spicy shrimp) and the Paella con mariscos estilo Ensenada (Rice with seafood Ensenada style) which were amazing!! Really a bargain price for the quality and quantity of food. Surprisingly, the tacos, while good, were mediocre compared to the other amazing dishes they serve."}
{"text":"Tacos de camar√≥n tacos de pescado.  This place is amazing. Food is great. Service is great! Highly recommend. Great quality food for a great price. Definitely try the fish and shrimp tacos!!!  Definitely good for small groups and kids. This place holds its own against other seafood places."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It's convenient to my home in Coronado, nicely priced and delicious. Definitely going back for the beer specials."}
{"text":"They have the best shrimp tacos. They also have another amazing taco callled el emperador and it is amazing."}
{"text":"I went to this place because I had a restaurant.com certificate but they did not honor saying that the owner did not authorize it...which is fine i can get a refund. Anyway i love seafood...we ordered and it took a while to start getting our food. I got the coctel de camaron which was ok. Then my husband got his botana de camaron con pulpo...it was so small for the price i couldnt believe it! It tasted good though...my biggest dissappointment though was the ceviche de camaron...the moment i saw it i knew i was not going to eat that...it was so raw...like completely raw...i returned it and was told its because it takes a day to cook ot completely with the lemon...youre telling me? Ive been eating this all my life i know jow to make ceviche and it takes an hr or a little more...but its a restaurant it shouldve been ready for customer. People were nice...but wont be returning...at least to this location. Ill stick to Mariscos Playa Hermosa or Islas de Capitan both in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We love the fish tacos here. Stop in once a month on our trip between flagstaff and Tucson. The chef Martin sees us coming and knows exactly what we will order! Everything is always fresh and delicious. The service is friendly and efficient. Very convenient off highway I-17."}
{"text":"Some of the best stuffed fish I've ever had. Their variety is ridiculous, this was our first time and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I had the pasta primavera with shrimp and it came with 2 garlic breads.  My husband ordered 2 fish tacos and shrimp tostada and both my childrend ordered 2 fish tacos.  Everything was delicious!! The mechiladas with victoria beer was good too"}
{"text":"Great place for good seafood!! You have to try the Paella con mariscos estillo Ensenada!! AWESOME!!  The chips and salsa are the best we had since moving here from Dallas!!"}
{"text":"I was on a mission to have Mexican food that was NOT either tacos, tortas, or burritos. This was my first time having mariscos in Arizona and it was great!  Try the shrimp with the Veracruz sauce. Large portions, friendly service, great atmosphere (jukebox with ranchero music full blast!), 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family since I was a child, and this place has always been the best! Love that the owner is the one who does all the cooking and setting up of the plates! The lemonade is amazing too! Better than any other mariscos place!"}
{"text":"Server was quick and friendly. Seafood was fresh and made to order. I had the seafood stuffed filet & my friend had the meatball soup(she gave a thumbs up). We also had the churros w/ ice cream for dessert and it was DELICIOUS! (Free dessert too w/Yelp check-in). Definitly plan to return!"}
{"text":"This was one of my first introductions to Sonoran style seafood and it is still one of my favorites! My favorites are the ceviche verde de camaron, which is so far the only place in Phoenix I found this at, the pescado mojo de ajo and anything with smoked marlin. I have not had a bad thing there yet and been going there since about 1998. This is how I like to eat in Mexico and glad to know I don't have to wait to go there to enjoy some good Sonoran sea food."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot . looking for some Mariscos this place will come thru. Coctails filled to the top stuffed with shrimp and octopus ...the lunch plates we had the 3 tacos and rice and beans it was like 6 dollars and it was a plate shrimp fish carne asada no problem and no up charge.. If you haven't had a michelada get a few with your favorite imported beer delicious and goes well with the seafood hands down .. Server was good took good care of us definitely a spot to hit when rolling thru that side of town .."}
{"text":"Best Chimichanga I've ever had, shrimp and fish filling. Don't expect great decor but be assured the food makes up for any deficiencies in appearance. Staff is very pleasant and unobtrusive. An out if the way place we found by mistake."}
{"text":"Never will I go back to this place.

I love Mexican Style Seafood, and well, this is horrible.

I ordered some toritos, which is shrimp and cream cheese stuffed yellow chiles, and bacon wrapped. When they came out, they were the smallest chiles I've ever seen, and they were completely burnt...like the bacon was black! They came served over some decorative cabbage with some black sauce that tasted asian...the decorative cabbage tasted better than those toritos.

I ordered a campechana, which is a seafood cocktail, there was NO flavor, but at least it wasn't filled w/ veggies, it did have some shrimp, oysters, etc.

My boyfriend order a \"molcajete\", which is usually a campechana cocktail on steroids (as well as the price), and well, it had even less seafood than my campechana. Again, completely flavorless. 

The service was not great, the girl came to check on us twice on the entire time we were there, and she wasn't very polite.

The place looks old and dirty.

The prices are HIGH.

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Love the food here. I enjoy coming here all the time. The service is very good and friendly. The tacos are amazing and the carne asada."}
{"text":"I love this place! They're super friendly and FAST! I've gotten the cheese enchiladas a couple of times and they are SO good! The margaritas are strong, which I love. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat and good food ordered a shrimp and octopus al mojo de ajo I didn't like the flavor of it so I asked to order something else the lady said yes so from there she was taking her sweet time on my order and then I asked her for ranch and still was taking her sweet time on it as well after 10 min my husband went to ask for the ranch."}
{"text":"I am going to return here again and again. The shrimp tacos are my favorite and the prices are amazing. I recommend this place not only for the food but the customer service."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time at this particular restaurant and loved the authenticity of their food..their salsa was good! I had the fish tacos..they were fresh tasting, no fish flavor at all=]
I had a beer for only $2.25(i believe). My husband had an octopus tostada..which when i took a bite of, it was delicious.
So, if your looking for a yummy mariscos place to eat where they are friendly and it's clean, i would go back again, for sure!"}
{"text":"For my first time here with an Ethnic Dining Lunch MeetUp, I found my 3 taco lunch special (1 fried shrimp taco, 1 fried catfish taco, 1 shredded beef taco, all topped with diced tomatoes and cabbage), boring and unremarkable, not the 4.5 stars I read.  The bottoms of all 3 tacos fell out before I picked them up so had to ask for additional tortillas, even beans and rice, boring.  Server said the bottoms fell out because I put salsa in the tacos (I did that because I found the flavor boring). I think my fellow diners liked their selections better than I liked mine.  Guy who ordered the \"drunken shrimp\" (like a cerviche, the shrimp was raw) really loved his order, tho I thought the portion was very small for $16.95.  I guess I am comparing that price with AYCE shrimp cooked 5 different ways at an Asian buffet that you can eat for lunch for $8.  

Except for the lunch special items, I think the food here is kinda expensive for the building and area, and in some cases, the portion size, like  the actual size of the fish fillet on  the Veracruz order.      

I might come back to try something else, but really I think La Santisma's food just a few doors south on same street and side, is much better in taste, portion size (not  talking about beans and rice!), and La Santisma is also 4.5 Yelp stars.  I rate LS's food 5 stars, highly recommend the marlin quesadilla (a large empanada sealed and fried), that I made 3 dinners out of.   You could make a dinner just out of their 16 kinds of salsa, in the salsa bar, alone.   3 stars for Mariscos Ensenada for the food.   La Santisma was on Check Please, recently, too.  I'd be interested in people's comparison of LS's food to ME's since both are 4.5 stars.

I rate the service (we had 11 people at our table) today, when restaurant was NOT busy or packed, 1:30 pm, 4 stars."}
{"text":"First time. Had the tostada de Ceviche de Jaiba and ceviche de Cameron. So yummie. Had a craving and satisfied it for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is blah, nothing special and overpriced. Wished I liked since it's near me but probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"I am from San Diego and have spent my fair share of time eating my way down the Baja peninsula. Having said that, this is the best Mariscos I have had since moving to Arizona. Very authentic. How can you beat awesome Mexican paella for 14 bucks? The bacon wrapped shrimp were to die for. Large, plump, juicy shrimp wrapped with crispy bacon. Six of them plus rice and beans for 13 dollars is a very good deal.

The service was great. Three of us ate till we burst for about 50 bucks. I would give five stars but the location is remote and near the airport so not a great area. Still, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish n shrimp tacos and I was pretty disappointed! Not much flavor in the shrimp or fish. The salsa did help but overall they were weak tacos. I'd rather stick to rubio's for tacos. I didn't order anything else so this rating is just based off tacos."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! We ordered a carne asada burrito, carne asada tacos, fish tacos, and some ceviche mixta tostadas and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed with any of it. The portion sizes are decent too. You have to try the chipotle sauce, it's amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
