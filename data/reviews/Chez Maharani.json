{"text":"Not very impressed with this restaurant. Looks very clean and nice from the outside. However our dishes were dirty that the food was going to be served to us in. The food and tea took forever to come out.. as there were many guests and only one server for everyone. Food in terms of taste was mediocre. Would not come back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Just avoid the veggie thali it's was really bad. Food was swimming in oil. The naan was not fully cooked."}
{"text":"I came here for an unofficial soft opening party. The entrance is eaay to miss as it is located in the basement, under a hotel. Previously called Dhera, this place was bought out and renamed \"Chez Maharani\". I love the location conveniently situated on the Hipster St. Denis strip, as there aren't a lot of good Indian food stops on this area. 

Menu: you can dine in or have food to go. There are combos starting at 10$. 

We got to try an open buffet style - with a few of their selections, note house chef was away so review may not be accurate : 

Starters: mango lassi (4/5) really enjoyed this drink - wasn't too heavy on the yogurt either; fish pakoras (3/5) - very tender, lightly spiced batter served with a side of spice mayo; 

Main course :biryani (3/5) I liked how it wasn't too heavy on the ghee; potato puri (5/5)- delish! ; daal (4/5)- had a sweet spicy kick to it ; mixed vegetable \"Sabji\" (3/5)-cauliflower, cabbage, onions, potato (I usually don't like cauliflower but I actually cleaned my plate off); beef curry (5/5)- it was sauteed with peppers, very tender - not too spicy - meat melted off the bone; chicken curry (4/5) similar the  the beef curry with peppers but I enjoyed the beef more.

Dessert: gulab jamun honey balls (6/5) I overdosed on the sweetness, had to limit myself to one to be healthy ; rice tapioca (4/5) worked really nicely with the gulab jamun to balance out the sweetness. 

Service: great, minus the fact students work here - that always appear confused when serving food. 

We got a tour of the venue, highlight being the backyard 2 floored terasse - gorgeous for the summer if they upgrade their bar.

The owner mentioned there is a lot of work to be done to the venue, looking forward to what's to come!"}
