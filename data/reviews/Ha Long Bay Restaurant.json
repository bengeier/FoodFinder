{"text":"I was very disappointed about my lunch today. I chose to meet my friend at Ha Long Bay Restaurant because we were craving Vietnamese. It's a spot I eat at quite often when meeting a friend at a half-way point downtown. The place was not busy, but we waited a bit for our menus. When we received our meals, my friend was surprised because she thought she had ordered beef, not tofu. We asked the waiter if it was us who got it wrong and he promptly grabbed a menu to PROVE to us that it was what we ordered. When I asked if he could perhaps take it back, remove the tofu and add some beef, he shook his head and walked away. I traded some of my beef and took a few pieces of tofu only to discover it was cold and greasy! My vermicelli was cold too but I ate it. My friend had lost her appetite and didn't take more than a bite. I, very nicely,  suggested to the waiter that they might not charge for my friend's meal because it wasn't good. He started yelling at us! You order! You pay! We paid. We left and will never go back. For $1.00 worth of beef they could have kept a regular customer.   For a good meal at a place where they treat customers well, I suggest you head a few blocks north-east and eat in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is one of my first choices to quickly satisfy a Vietnamese craving attack which, like a ninja, comes fast and furious. While I appreciate the Vietnamese sub and other delights, I am fiend for pork and spring roll vermicelli noodle bowls (number 41 on their menu).  Chosen mainly for convenience (it's about a block away from my office), I can't praise the decor or the atmosphere; I usually get takeout to avoid being seen under the flourescent lights. And I will admit that there are probably better Vietnamese places around. But this is a quick, cheap, eat-at-your-desk lunch option for someone on the go."}
{"text":"JUST came back from lunch at this place. Food was quick but that's about the only positive thing I can say. The noodle beef I had lacked any real beef or noodles and it was $10.50 for something I can usually get for about $8. No basil leaves either. Service leaves much to be desired for -  server bumped into my friend and spill his water all over the table and my pants without much apology. Not surprising the accident happened as they try and fit as many people as they can into the establishment so it is very cramped! Right after we paid we were asked to leave so they could sit the imaginary line of customers. Sorry, will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love the beef sate soup here! The broth is one of the best I've had. Service is always quick and they get takeout orders ready quickly."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food. I love eating vermicelli and I love eating pho. I ordered the chicken and spring roll vermicelli and it was less than delicious.  It's not hard to please me when it comes to vermicelli but the bowl I had today was bland. The chicken didn't have much flavour and the fish sauce just made everything taste watered down.   Basically it's alright if you're in a pinch but it's also overpriced..."}
{"text":"Terrible Service, i didnt tip enough so the guy said \"F-Word \" to me. NEVER going back. Such high prices. I realize it is downtown but no excuse for rudeness. Let it be clear they only care about money.  Not recommended. Better Vietnamese food in Forest Lawn"}
{"text":"My coworkers like coming here - it's close by, efficient (esp when you're on a time constraint) and moderately priced for a downtown restaurant. If I choose a place for Viet food, Ha Long wouldn't be my first choice. I find the food quite westernized (esp the pho) and it's set up almost cafeteria style that you feel rushed when you eat here (could also be the hoard of people lined up at the door during peak lunch hours waiting to get in)  If I do come here, my go to is the spring rolls & pork with vermicelli. Can't go wrong with spring rolls right?"}
{"text":"Same ole story, recommended by co-workers, epic fail.  I thought I would give this place a try to form my own opinion to share with others.  I ordered the beef, chicken and shrimp rice vermicelli dish and substitute the shrimp for more chicken.  The woman at the counter said no problem, however getting back to the office it sure didn't look like more chicken.    The spring rolls were decent, the overall taste of the dish was bland, and an odd taste to the fish sauce.  The dish was expensive, totaling $15, $5 more than the food truck I had the week prior that had a much better offering of a similar dish.   If you are in a hurry and have a Vietnamese food fix as as you're running late for a meeting, then maybe give this place a try as it was fast service for take out.  However, I recommend to save your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Do not ever come here on your own free will. I can understand if you're dragged here by your co-workers and they may feel that this place is awesome to their untrained phoreign tongues. This place is probably one of the worst places I have ever had the displeasure of eating pho at.  You read my reviews and you know how much I love pho. I eat it everywhere and I eat it many times a week and I will never say no to trying anywhere that serves it.   My boss and I had so many opportunities to go anywhere but this place and after foolishly convincing me to hop on the ctrain for whatever reason (we had no real reason to get on besides the fact that it is free downtown) and ended up by Art Central and hopping on the train again and end up coming back to the 4th street station.  We walked over and saw Ha Long Bay as I have seen so many times walking to TD. Don't be fooled by the name as Ha Long Bay is a really beautiful place in Vietnam but unfortunately in Calgary its a sight for sore eyes.  I'm going to go right into the food and tell you how bland and boring the broth was. That basically ruins my meal right there. I should have known when we walked into the restaurant and there was literally just one table aside to ours in that place.  Normal good, decent, average Vietnamese restaurants will be jam packed at lunch time but this place wasn't and that sums it up.  Did I mention the price? Two bowls of pho, a plate of spring rolls and two coffees cost me about $50??? If you're going to charge downtown price then be sure your restaurant has downtown taste."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Atmosphere: 2.5/5 Service: 2.5/5 Overall experience: 2.5/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  As usual, the prices here are a tad pricey for Vietnamese and there is nothing unique about the place. The restaurant is dingy, unkempt, and has that icky fluorescent light feel to it. The servers were didn't seem too friendly, but the nice thing was that the food came out pretty fast.   My bf ordered their beef pho and I got the satay beef sub. I found the broth pretty tasty compared to some places, but the portions were too small for the price (~$10) which wasn't worth it. There was little noodles and a few meat pieces. I thought the subs were really pricey (~$7) but I enjoyed every bite of it. It had nice caramelized onions and the meat was super flavorful. The ratio of bread to filling was perfect and I love the addition of nuts  for texture and that extra oomf. One of the main reasons i gave this place a 3. There was the addition of lettuce in the sub which was odd since I don't think it's traditional and didn't really add anything to it.  Overall, Ha Long Bay is okay but I wouldn't come back except for their subs 'IF' i happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Again, one of those places I've past dozens of times, decided to finally stop in with a friend today.  Food - both of us ordered the raw beef and meatballs pho.  It was tasty, but a bit strange.  I can't put my finger on it, but I've had my share of pho at most places in Calgary and this didn't taste 100% \"authentic\".  It was lighter in color and taste that the other places that boil their soup recipes overnight, etc.  It tasted a little bit metallic and that told me it might have either some flavor enhancer in it or the broth is from boullion.  Either way, it was OK, but not great. Also had the fried Won Tons as appys - no.  That's it, just no. Price - was a big high for a bowl of pho, but could be the rent for DT core. Service - fast and efficient.  The turnaround from order to food was 5 minutes, at lunch time.  Very fast.  Overall - have to give it a 3.  Broth was good and hot, but something was off, just can't quite figure it out.  Price was a little high.  Place was packed, so they'll be around for a long time."}
{"text":"An average Vietnamese lunch.  I did not really like the vermicelli bowl that I had here, but I had to bump it up from two stars as my taro bubble tea was really good. My coworkers really like this place, but I do not. Maybe the subs are better?  Only pop in to grab a bubble tea if you happen to be walking by."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place. The place is not that busy and service is so so. So ordered the rare beef and well done beef pho. The soup doesn't have much flavor to it. It is definitely more expensive then their competitor and they are very skimpy on the beef.   It is funny to watch the owner. I noticed how he told one customer (table beside us) \"don't come back\" because the credit card machine kept on not working and the owner had to go back and forth to go get a new machine. When we heard it we were shocked.   The restaurant is somewhat run down. Quality and price doesn't match"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and it was ok...  Not the best Vietnamese place I have been, but is not bad... The location is very convenient; and the service fast at lunch time.. The spring rolls are good.."}
{"text":"This place has the best beef sate sub I can find in Calgary. They add this peanut sauce that is amazing. It's so good that my coworkers I've told about it keep going back!!! It's best done through takeout.  If you're not in the mood for a sub, the vermicelli and rice bowls come out really quick if you do takeout.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Proverbial \"noodle place\" in the downtown - with small, crowded, sticky tables, and shaky, worn chairs.  Millions of plates to choose from - on the menu - all of which being essentially the same, if you'd actually try to compare a few.  Food quality is very ordinary, though service was rather fast.  Can't really recommend Ha Long Bay for anything, unless you are on that particular corner of the downtown and feel like some noodles for lunch."}
