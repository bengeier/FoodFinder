{"text":"We went for restaurant week and the food was wonderful. Really delicious! Their signature cocktails aren't at all up my alley but some will enjoy, I'm sure. I took off one star because the interior looked less 'contemporary' and more 'cheap', and because a $10 glass of wine should be a full 6oz pour. The view is great, but the inside is loud, and the patio seating seems unfinished."}
{"text":"Getting caught up on some reviews after starting a crazy-busy job.  My first impression walking into Fresco was that the decor and table settings seemed a bit on the pretentious side.  But then I was blown away by the unique view of Madison, and then...the FOOD.  I ordered the short ribs, which were indescribably delectable and moist (I HATE that word, but, well...they WERE!).  I liked everything about this dish, right down to the smoky polenta.  My dining partner had the ricotta cheese gnocchi, which was perfectly toothy and delicious.  She mentioned that the sun-dried tomato detracted from the brown butter herb sauce, and after tasting it, I had to agree: they really didn't belong.  But everything else about the meal was so spot-on--great service, fantastic views, and transcendent food--that this goes down as a #1 date/birthday destination."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten at Fresco many times over the past couple of years. We only go when we attend the symphony since the restaurant is located in the same building on the rooftop. Food always excellent, perfectly portioned, and delicious! Service is always friendly and professional. In fact, we're going there tonight :)"}
{"text":"This place blew me away.  I can be a snob and my expectations for Madison restaurants are pretty low.  But WOW.  One of the 25 best meals of all time anywhere.  First of all, the place is gorgeous . . . but everyone knows that.  The service was perfect.  The food though . . . grilled pumpkin salad, perfect steak and the kale potato side that came with was excellent.  It's hard to explain how those very simple things could stand out so much, but go find out.  It's the first place I'll go next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Everything but the food was awesome!  The atmosphere and service were fantastic. The food was well-plated and pretty, but waaaay overpriced and uneven in preparation and flavor.  This did not feel \"farm to table\"... Won't go back a second time and will not be recommending this restaurant to friends. this place seems to be riding on the location, which is nice, and hype. If you are looking for freshness and a more locavore experience, head the GRAZE...."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often and when I do it's typically because I want to tell the world about an amazing experience I have had. This is my first negative review. Last night, we had 8pm reservations for my birthday. We were seated outside at about 750... It was somewhat busy. Looked like the 7pm rush was starting to turn over. A waitress came over after about 10 minutes and asked us if we would like drinks (she did know it was my birthday and said to save room for a complimentary dessert... That is the only positive thing I have to say). It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. She did come over during that 20 minutes and said that they were out of something and that our drinks would be coming soon. She took our order for a charcuterie plate and tempura. We did not order entrees at that point. We got our drinks. 30 MINUTES later we did not have our appetizers nor did the waitress come over once to apologize/check-in/ask us for our entree order. We watched table after table get their appetizers (even when they had sat down after us). I finally mentioned to the young man who looked like the manager if there was a hold up in the kitchen. He said he would check to see what was going on. At that point, we decided to leave so my entire night would not be ruined (first time we have EVER left mid-meal). The waitress came over to tell us our charcuterie would be out in a minute!!!!!!!!!!!!! (WTF it's meat and cheese with bread people!!!) I asked for the check. I called our fave Cento around the corner and they were willing to take us at closing and turned a disastrous birthday dining experience into an amazing one!!! In fairness, as I was on the phone with Cento, the man who I presumed to be the manager did ask if there was anything he could do. Too little, too late. I also should mention that Fresco went in and canceled our reservation on Open Table so that we would be unable to leave a review. Not only was the service awful but the establishment is Sneaky. Won't be returning...too many fabulous restaurants in this town to try it a 2nd time."}
{"text":"I've only been here on restaurant week and it is a fantastic deal but wouldn't pay full price for their normal menu. They have the best bread: soft, pillowy mounds of perfect buttery rolls of goodness. I want to go there just to have their bread! I normally get their chicken gnocchi and it never dissapoints. Their desserts are pretty good most of the time and they serve classic flavor combos with a creative twist."}
{"text":"If you live within 10 miles of this place and don't go at least once a week, you are doing yourself a disservice. Every time I am in the area, I MUST drop in for a bingsoo. It never disappoints. The word \"refreshing\" comes to mind every time. Can't go wrong with mango, pineapple, strawberries, with mango sauce. Top it off with boba and you've got the best dessert around. Seriously, you need to go... now."}
{"text":"I've been here about five times over the past couple of years.  Overall, I think it's a nice part of the Madison restaurant  scene.  The setting is fun...they are going for a sleek, big city, ultra modern kind of feel.  The view is great too, especially in the summer when you can sit outside.  

They have a nice drink list.  I've been happy with the wines I've tried and they have some fairly novel cocktails as well.  Drink prices are best if you can come for their late night happy hour.

As far as food, prices are in line with other mid-range restaurants in Madison, like Sardine, Muramoto, etc.  I've been satisfied with the food each time I've visited.  Never the best meal of my life, but definitely good.  They start with buttery parmesan rolls, and then you can chose from their rotating menu of seasonal options.  I've always gone with chicken, pork or fish, never tried the pasta or beef options.  Again, always happy with the entree.  I've tried dessert a few times and it was always tasty.

Never a problem with service, I would say it is average or slightly above for a place like this."}
{"text":"This can be a fantastic evening out between the cuisine, ambiance, view, cool beverages and neon vibe. It feels more Boston than Madison to me. Even when it is not fantastic it is still very good. I love the salmon. The prices are high but worth it. This is a great special occasion restaurant.
Just thinking about it makes me happy."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple of times now and it's one of my favourites in Madison. The menu changes frequently so there is no getting bored, and there is a dedicated gluten free menu, which is almost the same as the normal one (ie is not limited to a couple of choices). The food is really good, well-portioned, and fairly priced. The only tiny criticism I had last time is that the GF menu was very fish/shellfish heavy - all of the starters and half of the mains were fish or shellfish.

The wine selection is good and again fairly priced. The cocktails are also really tasty - I wish there were more of them! The service has also been great both times we were there. The setting is lovely - there is a limited view of the city from inside the restaurant but the outside terrace gets some cool views, especially of the capitol. Overall, we love it and we'll be back."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of trying new dishes and love desserts, this is the perfect place!  Fresco, located in Chandler, Arizona is known for their delicious dish of Korean dessert called \"Bingsoo\".  There are many different variations in making bingsoo and this is just one way of how it is made.  Bingsoo at Fresco consists of shaved ice, frozen yogurt or ice cream, selection of various different fresh fruits, and fruit puree.  What you do is select fruit toppings, either frozen yogurt or ice cream, (the yogurt is most commonly recommended) and your choice of fruit puree, which are strawberry, kiwi, mango or honey.  You mix it all together and once you take a bite, it is like you are in heaven.  It is so light and refreshing, not to mention a lot healthier than ice cream or any other desserts.  Not only is the bingsoo tasty, but the atmosphere is friendly as well.  The shop is very clean and well decorated with Korean music playing in the background.  The employees are very friendly and helpful if you are a first timer at Fresco and there is even a poster on the wall showing directions on how to order.  They even give out punch cards for frequent bingsoo buyers and on the 10th punch, you get one for free!  I highly recommend this place and give it two thumbs up and a five star rating."}
{"text":"We tend to go to fresco for special events.  The do \"market dinners\" in the summer where all of the food is sourced from the farmers market and several of the farmers will come and talk about the food.

The wine list is quite good, the staff is always very friendly and the food is good.  It also has one of the best views in Madison which results in us often going here just for drinks to enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just not that good for what they charge. For as much as we spent, I wanted to feel more than \"meh\" about the food. The chicken fresco was fine, but nothing earth shattering or even vaguely creative; my companion's steak was ordered medium rare and came out closer to medium well, which was a disappointment. Service was good, and of course the view is great - it's just the food that isn't worth another look. It just kind of feels like they're coasting on their location, which isn't enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"The service here was great and the food was delicious and done at a good price. More importantly though the view and the atmosphere are unparalleled in madison. Definitely a restaurant to have on your \"need to do\" list."}
{"text":"Some the best food I've had in the Midwest.  A bit loud environment but overall a nice dining experience.  Halibut was the bomb.!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime we go to Fresco we say the same thing, \"why don't we go more often?\"
Lovely restaurant, great view, but the star is the food.
Last Thursday we started with the port poached figs with cheve and apple,and the  jumbo garlic spicy shrimp. Both were wonderful.
For entrees we had the Fresco chicken and Pork Schnitzel. Each dish was beautifully presented and delish!"}
{"text":"Had a date night with my lady, I ordered the hanger steak, medium. Came out pretty rare/medium rare. Oh well, I can deal with that and it was pretty good. Girlfriend ordered the lamb. Came out absolutely raw!  Our server was great and did her best to remedy the situation. The manager realized that we were served raw meat and comped our meal. Can't blame anyone but the cooks. $30 for raw lamb. Great view from the restaurant. That's about it."}
{"text":"Waited 75 minutes for burnt quiche and wilted salad. My friend's chicken sandwich was also burnt. Never got any refills on my tea. My friend waited over 30 minutes for her Bloody Mary.  Terrible service, terrible food, no apologies.  Fixed price brunch, $25."}
{"text":"GNOCCHI! (and great service, too!)

Went in for Gnocchi Night one of the only specials that Fresco runs. Cheap plates of super rich, super creamy Gnocchi. They were serving the dish with a few new sauce choices: I tried the original and also the temporary broccoli cheese sauces. Both were incredible.

My friend and I sat at the bar and had great service. It was a fairly slow night for them, however, so that was helpful. 

The space is very dark but because of that it was super personal. It would be a great place to go on a date.  Overall totally enjoyed my time here and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This was the rare experience in which I was so satisfied with my meal that I had to come home and immediately write a review. I am visiting Madison and decided to try Fresco for dinner because of the excellent reviews and its cool views of the Capitol. I wasn't letdown.

I hesitantly ordered the Chicken Fresco, which was a roasted chicken breast on the bone with parsnips, carrots, roasted potatoes, and a butternut squash puree. I say 'hesitantly' because chicken breast is notoriously boring but I was wanting something lighter than beef and they were out of the salmon that night. I am glad I made the call for this dish because it was superb.

The chicken was perfectly crusted on the outside with simple seasonings, and surprisingly juicy and flavorful on the inside as well. The accompanying vegetables were delicious too-- full of flavor and cooked perfectly, maintaining firmness without being too raw. The butternut squash puree added an appropriately sweet balance to the sea salt on the chicken. I was impressed with all of it.

To top it all off, the staff were just the right mix of attentive without being overly solicitous. And the view was everything that was described. A random but welcomed surprise on this trip to Madison!"}
{"text":"Solid comfort food.  Generous portions.

Scallop app, beet salad, and halibut are all great.  NY Strip steak was over cooked but still flavorful.  

Not sure it lives up entirely to it's farm-to-table claims, but I still enjoyed our meal.  \"A\" for efort."}
{"text":"Great service. Had a wonderful piece of salmon, cooked to perfection. What a treat. Ceasar salad was good, but a bit wilty. My husband had the cioppino, it was good but not $26 worth of good; even with the few bites I had, I kept revisiting the taste throughout out the night, if you know what I mean. Can't understand why they resort to the dough ball bread, which resembles the taste of Olive Garden bread sticks. For the prices charged I want some fresh, outstanding bread! The chocolate cake with the peanut butter mousse was disappointing. That salmon I had is worth going back for."}
{"text":"The plating is really good~ great ambiance and great view, but in terms of good itself, I would say it's hit or miss. Good for date"}
{"text":"I was just in Madison for my brother's graduation and our family chose Fresco for a celebration dinner.

Ambiance:
Beautiful!! The first words that came out of my mouth: \"Wow! I can't believe a place like this exists in Madison.\" We might as well have been in a modern, sleek hotel in Manhattan or London. The floor-to-ceiling windows made it truly beautiful to dine amongst the night lights of nearby buildings, including the Capitol.

Food: 
The only reason that I'm not giving Fresco 5 stars is because although the food was good, I don't think any of us left the restaurant swept off our feet. I had a mixed greens salad with goat cheese and asparagus to start. I think my brother could have made it (he barely cooks). Then I had salmon with beets and crispy truffled potato chips. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the combination of flavor was great, but it was a bit too salty for all of our tastes.

Overall, a solid 4 stars! I would go back mostly for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Our Server was AMAZING (I wish I could recall her name!  oops!).  The food & drinks were really great!  Tough to get a reservation, but I'm glad we chose to have a 9:30 dinner just to get a table. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been here for a couple of years and had friends join us who had never been. It was a disappointment for everyone. My husband and I ordered soup and it was lukewarm at best. My husband ordered the mussels with frites. I had some of the frites and they are a bit greasy for my taste. The entree's were okay, but nothing exceptional based on the prices that are charged. I realize that a lot of it is the location and atmosphere but I expected the food to be much better. The service was great though - very friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner and it was great! We had Kelli as our server and she was awesome. Very attentive and kept a good conversation. We had the chicken and vegetable dumplings for an appetizer, they were good but the soy sauce was a little bit overpowering. For entrees we had the chicken breast and steak. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome ambience.  Decent wine list as well.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Dinner was OK.  Dessert was horrible.  I had the bacon wrapped pork, and it was good.  Wife had chicken and mashed potatoes.  Chicken was a bit dry and just a dollop of potatoes (should have been more).  Dessert was a disaster.  Chai tea creme brule was brutal.  No taste.  Consistency of old hardened gravy.  I had chocolate cake that had no chocolate taste and was dry.  Honestly, among the worst desserts we've ever had.  Had Taylor as our server and she was great (and her first night working there).  Could have given only 2 stars, but the setting was nice and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Great drinks, scenery, location. Food was a bit lacking. My food came out cold. The seafood pasta dish had a bland sauce. 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"Bingsoo is incredible. Yummy frozen yogurt and fruit - it seems healthy and tastes great. Warning - dont add the red beans to the bingsoo. Not sure why anyone would want it, but we tried it and it completely ruined the dessert. Go for the boba add-on instead"}
{"text":"My family and I had my 2nd graduation dinner here and we all loved the food, view and the service! Their muscles, steak and seafood pasta are awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying I only went here for drinks, so I can't judge the food. The drinks, however, were underwhelming. I had a mojito, and a lime/gin cocktail. My table mates had several other cocktails that I tried as well. All of them were overly sweet and tasted kind of watered down. My mojito was so sweet I could barely drink it, I think the bartender may have added more simple syrup instead of any alcohol, because I swear there was no booze in it. There's better places for cocktails around the capital area, this felt like an overpriced rip off. The patio was pretty though."}
{"text":"I love how this restaurant is encased by huge windows and offers beautiful views of the area.  I had dinner here last month and was very impressed.  Everything on the menu sounded so simple but was presented very artistically.  The Chips and Fish was a surprise.  I'd never had sea scallops prepared like flat potato chips.  It was delicious.  The Winter Squash Bisque was warm, velvety and awesome.  I liked how they used the almond brittle to add a different texture but I didn't prefer it that much.  The American Berkshire Pork was a little too salty from the salt and pepper crust for me, but it was very tasty and cooked perfectly along with the brussel sprouts.  The Organic Norwegian Salmon was perfect.  I loved the balsamic reduction and the crispy leeks - wow!  We didn't have room for dessert but we were given a complementary small box of two pieces of chocolate made by Madison chocolatier Gail Ambrosius.  The chocolate was incredible and  it was the perfect end to our Valentine's Day dinner!"}
{"text":"We decided to go for dinner downtown on a beautiful May Saturday night and my wife wanted to go to Fresco.  located on the top of the Overture center the view is great. As expected we had to wait for a table outside and found 4 seats at the bar.  The bartenders were very friendly and suggested some great drinks. 
We were seated outside and had a very friendly waitress.  She was great all night.  
Unfortunately we started ordering food and things went downhill.  Ordered the mussels and they were bland at best with a fair number not even open.  I ordered the Fettuccine and the noodles were sticky with again a bland taste.  My Daughter ordered the Cod and said it was very plain.
Also, an odd observation but a table of 8 or 10 people left about the time we sat down and their empty table was left uncleared throughout the majority of our dinner (as were several others).

Maybe we hit a bad night but I don't think we will be going back soon.  Too bad as it is a nice venue."}
{"text":"First of all, I never been a rooftop restaurant, it is awesome. The vibe with surrounding is amazing. You can see far away from.roof also the capitol. The food is amazing. Ordered salmon it was A plus. My friend order lobster risotto, that was another good choice. The waiter \"Jimmy\" was very nice and friendly even though today was his first day working."}
{"text":"The best part about Fresco is sitting outside during the summer and enjoying the weather while looking at the rest of Madison's downtown. The food is decent but nothing too great or creative. They use local and seasonal ingredients when possible, which I consider a plus. The late night specials are a good deal. Service is attentive and friendly. Bring someone you're trying to impress with the Madison area."}
{"text":"The food was decent - chicken was tasty even if the vegetables were a little over done.

My main complaint is the service. As soon as our server, Lori, realized that we were not ordering any cocktails (thus probably not a huge bill), she literally ignored us. It was to the point that we had to ask other servers for things. My standards for service are actually not that high, but it is ridiculous to not have a server attend to your table because they think they won't make enough money off of you.

I will not be coming back here the next time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"We recently dined here for dinner on New Year's Eve with a group of 9 people. We were promptly seated and greeted by our waitress who was pleasant and helpful with drink and food suggestions. She was also more than willing to divide the bill into separate checks which was helpful for a large group! We enjoyed crab cakes, diablo shrimp, pork sliders and risotto cakes for appetizers and each were delicious. We also enjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant as it felt upscale but not pretentious. Our waitress came and told us that there was a small miscommunication in the kitchen and that our food would take a little longer. She brought additional appetizers out while we waited which demonstrated Fresco's attention to customer service and satisfaction. Our meals arrived shortly after. The Chicken Fresco and Short Rib entrees were plated beautifully and were very tasty. Overall, our dining experience was very good and we would be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Priceless location, amazing views, awesome food! 

We were in Madison for a wedding which happened to be in the Overture Center and found out that they have a rooftop restaurant which was highly rated. We decided to give it a try and were not disappointed. 

The restaurant has two sections, indoor with wall-to-wall glass which is a more formal setting and an outdoor terrace section which is right next to the modern art sculpture garden. We went for the outdoor section and it was absolutely wonderful. Weather was great, the views were amazing. They had a fine selection of wines as well as top-shelf liquor. I had the pistachio crusted lamb chops & shank which was heavenly and my wife had the farmer's market salad which she really liked a lot. We also had the flatbread appetizer which in itself was a meal. Overall the portions were quite generous but we managed to wipe our plates clean .. it was that good! :-)

Of course that meant we didn't have space for the dessert :-( ... maybe next time. 

Highly recommended for a great fine dining experience."}
{"text":"This place really delivered for us.  We were here with a family party of three generations for a Mother's Day dinner.  All were very pleased with the food and the ambiance.  The space is on the third floor of the museum and has windows on three sides.  There is a rooftop deck (I believe I overheard the host saying that that seating is first come-first served).  The Capitol Dome pops up over the nearby buildings.  Sculpture is on view on the deck.  The decor is plainly white and just provides an appropriately simple background to the great views.  The service we enjoyed was attentive and relaxed.  Although the cuisine was very much up to par with any white-tablecloth establishment, the atmosphere was such as to make the shorts-wearing deck crowd comfortable.  Among dishes we enjoyed were steak, salmon, pasta, scallops, spring rolls, mussels, and three desserts.  The cocktail list is inventive, and the wine list brief but of a decent variety to offer good pairings.  The PEI mussels in green curry appetizer was easily large enough to share, so I ate it all myself!  The scallops were had by two of our party, and the preparation was outstanding.  Perfectly cooked, a little rare in the center, and paired with mild cauliflower and a buerre blanc; this was a well-thought out and executed dish.  But I sure am glad that we saved room for dessert.  The cheesecake was a super-cute little half-sphere served on a bed of graham cracker crumbs and surrounded by lime slices.  The presentation was matched by the taste of the dish.  The chocolate cake is often gluten-free, but this night was not.  It was paired with pistachio ice cream and roasted pistachios.  I enjoyed the Earl Grey Creme Brûlée.  This is a good and inventive flavor combo, often creme brûlée is just so painfully sweet that even I begin to get sugar overload, but the bitterness of the tea is a great balance to the flavors.  It also gives the dish a funky color, which I totally applaud.  This place is definitely on my list for my next visit to town!"}
{"text":"Our visit to Fresco was underwhelming. There are huge windows looking out on....not much of anything. If you love views of rooftops, then this is your place. It was cold and wet outside so the rooftop dining was not an option. Inside the space is small, noisy, cramped and white...white walls, white floor, white tabletops. Our table was 2 feet from another table making it possible to hear every word spoken by the adjoining table without effort. With all the hard surfaces this was one of the noisiest restaurants I have ever been in which made it difficult to have conversation. 

The food was generally \"blah\". The small plate Kale salad was Kale, a weak vinegrette and extremely thin slices of poached pears that I wouldn't have known they were pears in a blind taste test. The spring rolls were fine, but include only a few crumbles of salmon.

My dining partners salmon was mostly dry except for the very middle. My lamb chops were flavorless. Lamb needs help with herbs and spice as it is an extremely mild meat, and this serving had none. The rest of the plate was highlited by a large smeat of hummus and a small amount of demi glace that had whole pea pods, single peas and tiny pieces of mushrooms. 

The service was excellent, but didn't make up for the space or the less than satisfying meal. I'm guessing a lazy evening of drinks on the patio would be a great experience, but we won't be returning for another $130 meal and drinks that left us cold. Thankfully, we had tickets for \"The Book of Mormon\" which more than made up for the over-hyped food at Fresco."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate with Fresco. For the location (rooftop) and view (all of State Street and the Capitol), Fresco gets a five-- it's perhaps the best in those two categories in the city.
However, with what they DO with that amazing space, they get them a 2 or 3. With the fantastic rooftop location and outdoor patio space, they should have more outdoor furniture, a cocktail bar, and a lounge-esque DJ/music set-up EVERY night in the summer (at least on weekend nights). It's really such a shame.
Still, the food is excellent (if not a tad pretentious) and the cocktail menu is nice. They have a fantastic happy hour deal in the summer (Fresco Fives) and they also have a late night-ish cheaper dinner menu sometimes.
While there's really a lot of room for improvement, the location on the top of the art museum and the high quality food and drink still earns them a solid 4."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely stunning restaurant to eat at! I have been here 3 times now and it is still by far the best place I have ever eaten. It has a great modern-age atmosphere with even better food! Located right on top of the Overture Center in downtown Madison, you can pretty much see Madison in all its glory! Their food is amazing and made-to-order, even the smallest of details. Also, the bread they bring out is simply the best in the world (to me at least haha) it is perfectly warm and buttery and easily comes apart with a slight tug. Wonderful place to eat and a great romantic dining experience. If you haven't been here before. GO"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Fresco for quite some time so I finally made reservations for my birthday dinner. Great specialty cocktail, great view, good food. Everyone at our table ordered dessert and they were some of the best parts of the meal so if I had advice to give it would be this: definitely save room for dessert when dining at Fresco. Would love to come back when it's warmer and I can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Small shop in a strip mall.  Bingsoo is so tasty with frozen yogurt!  Owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"Finally got back to Fresco... It's been a while. Why? Their menu was decent, but boring, never changed (for what, 5 years?). They finally UPDATED their menu... fall is here and so is a new menu! I was excited to check it out. We went on a beautiful 75 degree evening, and their fall menu stared back at me. Wasn't sure if it would work out: heavy dishes in moderate breezes, but the dishes were not heavy, a good betrayal to my eyes.

pros: 
the food 

Rolls - PERFECT! If I could, this is the highlight of the meal. These are squishy, soft, moist, peel-apart, salt buttered-topped yummy buns. These are THE BEST rolls I've ever eaten, and I'm from the South. I double-dog dare anyone to send me a comment about another place that serves rolls this moist and fluffy (esp. if It's near Madison)! They were free. 5/5 stars

Pan Roasted Monkfish - Very Good! Not a fishy taste, good texture, excellent crisp on the 4 edges (panfried in oil, not a breading), seated on lightly salted purple potatoes (cooked down, to my perfection, about to mush with a fork) and cut Kalamata olives, then bathing in just-the-right amount of puttanesca sauce (pureed) (Guys, won't be enough for you if you think this is slathered Italian sauce). The Fish and Sauce go great together, the potatoes are just extra flair on how to cook a fancy potato my favorite way. 4.5/5 stars

Chicken Fresco - Very Good! Crispy Chicken on bone, good skin and juicy meat. Sitting on top of Fresco's version of a stew: croutons, big english peas, red potatoes, carrots, onions, and what I call a garlic, chicken, vinegar gravy. SO good... slurp it up with one of their rolls. 4/5 star

The View - inside or out (it's more fun out)... great view.

The Drinks - Author and Artist: bourbon drink, good blend on alcohol, lemon

cons: 
waitress - took 10 min to get my alcohol! Errrrgh. Then she was just... boring. No mention of specials, what's her favorites, no embellishments of any kind, no... umm... dining foreplay. The food service went better - timing was average and food still warm. 3/5 stars

Appetizer - savory tarte tatin, a puff pastry with pears, caramelized onions, swiss chard spouts, add duck, minus chevre. We were quite hungry by then, so overall, it's filling and average, we liked it but it could be so much better. The pastry and the duck were over-cooked, but you could actually taste the pears and onions, they popped. I'd give it 3/5 stars (duck meat shouldn't be dried out! It needs all that wonderful fat and juice)

Just wrong: according to Yelp: the Seafood \"Cioppino Pasta was one of the top dishes\" here. They have taken it OFF the menu. Bad idea. Just Wrong."}
{"text":"I finally tried bingsoo. I ordered mine with banana, mango and pineapple with mango sauce and frozen yogurt. The frozen yogurt is divine! I wish I would have discovered this when it was 115 degrees outside, but its still good when the weather is a chilly 80 degrees. The shop is a cute little place in a strip mall. It is very clean and inviting. This is a super tasty refreshing treat and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I read the reviews, which are somewhat mixed, and I honestly didn't know what to expect. I told my husband on the way to the restaurant, \"I think we'll either love this or hate it.\" Well, we LOVED IT.
The pros: 
1) location! Beautiful rooftop location on State street above the contemporary art museum. Sofas for relaxing with a drink, art to look at...it's just great, particularly on a nice weather day! The restaurant itself has clean lines and a minimalist feel that works perfectly for its location.

2) The food! Really, really surprised by how good the food was as I was worried this was the kind of place that could skate by on location/ambiance alone. Nope. We had the tuna tartare appetize, a charcuterie plate, an entree of scallops, and a fish entree. All were out of this world good. I have never had such delicious scallops! My husband said his fish was top-notch and loved be greens that it sat upon. 

3) the service!!! Our waiters name was Jimmy and he may have been the best server I've ever had. Very friendly, knowledgable, and skilled at asking the right questions to help us determine just which menu items we would like the best. When he heard we were celebrating our anniversary he treated us to a beignet dessert that was fabulous. He also recommended a great bottle of wine which paired wonderfully with our entire meal. It was truly dinner bliss!

I would HIGHLY recommend Fresco and I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Fresco is definitely one of the tastiest restaurants in Madison. It is a great place for a romantic meal or if you have friends in town looking for a more refined meal. The views are great, and being able to walk out and about the garden area is quite lovely in the summer months. I always highly recommend the restaurant to anyone visiting the area.

I want to give major props to the restaurants and it's staff for dealing with a potentially frustrating situation this past week. My parents were in town, and I've been wanting to show them how awesome Fresco is. I made a reservation for 3 at 8:15pm, but, as it is a pretty small restaurant, our table was tied up until about 8:45pm. The hostess was genuinely apologetic and was able to nab us 3 seats at the bar. She let us know that we were welcome to order whatever appetizer we wanted for free. Since we were kinda hungry, we got our free appetizer, and then also ordered a 2nd, along with some drinks. Eventually we got our table and had an awesome meal. When the bill finally came, we checked the numbers and found that we weren't charged at all for our items at the bar! 2 appetizers and 3 drinks for free! My parents and I are pretty easy-going people and were in no hurry to get seated, so the complimentary beverages and food were greatly appreciated!

Long story short: I. Love. Fresco. Though I am a bit confused that their menu states that they \"buy local,\" and none of their wines are from the state..."}
{"text":"First time at Fresco.  super cool room, with a classy but relaxed vibe.  Two out of the three dishes were really really good! The salmon tartare appetizer with quail egg, fermented blueberries, and fried capers was fresh, unique, colorful, and worked really well!  the pulled chicken sliders with peanut, cilantro, and green papaya were also very tasty, and the rolls were so tender.  Both of those plates were rewarding.

The main entree (braised short rib over homemade pasta) was ok.  Lacked flavor.  Huge portion, but really needed more spice.  This one fell a bit flag for me.  service was outstanding, not obtrusive, but very focused.  would definitely recommend, although I do not live in Madison.  Glad I tried Fresco nonetheless!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is way too over hyped. The setting of the restaurant was wonderful. But the food is another story. The portions are very small and not very flavorful. I order the lamb chops and I expected to be stuffed when my date and I left. We were so disappointed and hungry after eating we went to taco bell to curve our hunger. This is a good place to grab a drank and a appetizer but not worth the price paid for entrees."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Lovely atmosphere with rooftop views in downtown. Very good service. We started with several small plates & enjoyed them all. Brussel sprouts were great.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner -  one thought their pasta was a little too spicey (hot). The mushroom gnochi was fabulous - one of the best things I ever ate. Halibut also delicious. Deserts & cocktails also great."}
{"text":"This restaurant on top of the Madison art museum is definitely on the fancier side. Decent service and great views justify the pricier nature of the meal. I was a big fan of tomato soup as well as our cocktails (fall mule and apple aquavit). The brussel sprouts and mahi mahi were decent, as was the service."}
{"text":"The servers are always friendly and moderately attentive. The food is acceptable but never over the top. The highlights are the space and views of state street."}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday evening with a couple of girlfriends for their winter gnocchi Thursday special: $12 for a bowl of gnocchi. Here's the lowdown:

-The gnocchi portions are quite generous! I was a lot more full than I expected to be (and I can eat. Seriously.)
-The gnocchi is served with vegetables, which I would imagine are not always the same. The night I was there it was peas, sun dried tomatoes, and green beans. 
-There are a variety of sauces to choose from. The night we were there it was their classic brown butter sauce, tomato, sharp cheddar with broccoli, and Sriracha. You can also add shrimp, chicken, or short ribs (though it will cost you an extra $10). I had the Sriracha with shrimp, which was creamy, but not heavy, and with a nice kick. The waitress emphasized that heat level was negotiable, so I could have had it spicier if I had specified. My girlfriends had the brown butter sauce with short ribs (double yum) and the cheddar with broccoli (like a high-class mac and cheese, so yumm). 

Other highlights:
-The mussels were delightful, though the portion is not super huge. They come with chorizo, onions, and bell peppers, as well as cornbread croutons (which are great). 
-They have a gluten-free menu! The items are mostly the same as the regular menu, but with minor alterations (ex. the tuna sashimi comes without the aioli). 
-Fabulous cocktails featuring tons of local liquors and ingredients. My friend had their \"new fashioned,\" which was a citrusy, bright take on an old fashioned. Their \"Los Grandes Margarita\" with chipotle was also delicious. 
-Great wine list as well. 

Not-so-great:
-We were sitting at a table by the window overlooking the sculpture garden and the capitol, and this table was right in front of the kitchen window. All of these things would ordinarily be pluses, but the kitchen was emitting some pretty strong, smokey smells, and I came home smelling kinda smokey, kinda greasy...I would imagine that this was a fluke, and not something that happens usually. It wasn't a negative enough part of the night to affect my rating, and my friends didn't even mention it, so they might not have even noticed."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an early dinner here before a concert at the Orpheum Theater. What a view! It was a nice fall night so we were able to enjoy the outdoor seating but would have been happy with sitting inside as the atmosphere is really cool. I started off with the Wedge Salad which is one of my all time favorite salads. I loved how the bacon, cheese, eggs and carrots all were on the side of the dish. The dressing was just right. That is one thing I am so picky about is how much or how little a restaurant puts on. This was perfect. My husband tried the Roasted Squash Soup which he really liked. The hot bread that comes out with your first side is VERY hot and wonderful. For my main course I had the Chicken Fresco. YUM! The chicken was so juicy and tender and the flavor was wonderful. It came with buttermilk chive risotto, green beans, bacon, oven roasted tomato sauce, crispy shallots. I loved this so much that I didn't have enough left over to even take home for lunch the next day. My husband of course had a steak. He had the New York Strip which came with garlic mashed potato, green bean, basil dijonnaise, scallion butter. He said his steak was exactly how he ordered it and was very good. We rarely order dessert but thought we would try it here as our food was so good. We shared the Chocolate Cake. Loved that as well. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable as this was our first time dinning here and had a few questions about the menu. After we finished our dessert we headed in to the bar where I enjoyed a dirty martini and my husband had a spotted cow. Great place for dinner down on State Street in Madison."}
{"text":"We had a grand old evening at Fresco. If the weather is nice, and you're out on the roof, there is just no nicer location to eat in Madison. The view of the Capitol in the evening is lovely. 

They've just redone their menu. Everything we had was very good or great. The lobster risotto as a starter was garlicky with big hunks of lobster. The chickpea ragu is not totally appealing to the eye but went down yummy. I had the bayoubaise -  the shrimp just stole the show. My partner was blown away by the gnocchi. 

It was our anniversary, and they gave us a complimentary dessert to celebrate, which was very sweet of them. The rosemary honey creme brulee was as good as the version of the classic at Sardine,which. I think, says a lot. Romantic and fun. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty suspicious with restaurants in museums, hotels, etc., but fresco was pretty good. The concept is neat - simple and modern. I went for dinner and most of the food was pretty good and I think the price was decent. We went with a group of 8 and had a really great experience. Service was great and their cocktails were good too. When we went, it was very quiet and chill."}
{"text":"Your life would not truly be complete if you haven't tried bingsoo.

Go there with a few people and share the largest bowl, so you can get a sample of everything available.

It is as delicious as all the reviews has described it to be.

They have really good boba drinks as well.  

This place seriously and easily trumps any \"yo-go\" place out there.  It is in a league of its own."}
{"text":"I moved back to Madison a little over a year ago and have had one of the best meals I've ever had here at Fresco.  We came in Sunday, a little after 5:00, there were just a couple people at the bar so we had our choice of tables.  We got seating with a nice view of their sculpture garden and the capital.  My husband and I got a bottle of red, our friend a bottle of white.  We were impressed with the wine selection and were happy with our choices.  We started out with the Shrimp Diablo.  3 jumbo shrimp came pretty quickly.  The garlic and chilli sauce on top was very delicious as were the shrimp themselves.  Of course we wished there had been more and almost ordered another one, but decided not to since our food would be out soon.  The place filled up pretty fast and seemed full by 6.  

Our friend ordered the Short Rib, my husband the Grilled Salmon and I got the Cioppino Pasta.  We all loved our entrees and what we had of each others.  The Pasta had a nice kick to it and was loaded with seafood all of which was cooked to perfection.  It was a huge portion too (I took 1/2 home.)  We kept making a lot of positive noises with each bite of our food.  :)  Since the appetizer and entrees were so good, we had to get dessert.  We split the Buttermilk Beignets and got a side of the Rhubarb Sorbet.  The beignets were to die for, we were so happy with everything that came to our table.

In addition to how incredible the food was, the atmosphere was amazing too.  Great views, great lighting, great staff.  This made us so excited for the Madison food scene.  It really is one of the best meals we've ever had and we'll for sure be back.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Amazing all around. :)"}
{"text":"Fresco is located right on State Street, right above the Museum of Contemporary Art and adjacent to the Overture Center. Have you ever wanted to see the iconic Orpheum sign from above? Make a reservation at Fresco. Better yet, the great view comes with great food. In the summer you can sit outside and dine under the stars, but Fresco is worth visiting any time of the year. If you go right after an Overture performance, I hope you've made a reservation. You'll also need patience, but it's all well worth the wait. Ask for extra bread (the bread portions are small), and ask your server not to butter the top. The bread is served warm and it's tasty. We started with charred broccolini with pepitas and parmesan; an exceptional dish. The niçoise salad with peppercorn-crusted tuna was close to flawless.  We had the pan-roasted chicken with arugula and pine nuts; we'd order it again anytime. We saw a burger served at another table with thick-cut fries identical to those served at Ladurée in Paris, and made a mental note of it for our next visit; it looked irresistible. And then, since our main courses took a bit longer to serve, Fresco offered us complimentary heirloom potatoes and crispy brussels sprouts served with bacon and russian dressing. Now, I can't stand brussels sprouts, but these were delicious; they were perfectly roasted and tasted great even without the [wonderful] sauce. This was an unnecessary gesture; we went to Fresco immediately after a sold-out performance of Carmen at the Overture, and so did many others.  The wait wasn't terribly long, but the gesture itself was classy and a sign of great service. It's not surprising: I recognized the manager, Danielle; she had been my favorite server at another restaurant. Here she was, hustling, bringing food to the tables, checking things in the kitchen, being in three or four places at once. A manager who doesn't stand around when the going gets tough but still manages to look friendly instead of frantic, sets the standard for the staff and the restaurant soars.  Give Fresco a shot; you'll enjoy both the food and the service!"}
{"text":"Fresco is a restaurant known for its rooftop views that are especially \"fun\" when you can sit outside on a beautiful summer day and look at the Madison landscapes and sunset while watching \"street life\" down below. I was really looking forward to it. 

Side note that leads into an interesting \"ethical\" debate: we rushed to Fresco after getting off the phone with the staff who said there was ONE table left on their outside patio. Right before we got there, we saw two other people heading to the elevator taking people up to the restaurant. I worked to subtly \"obstruct\" their path to the host/hostess desk, but my friend Paul K. said not to do it, explaining later that they got their first and it wasn't fair. WHAT?! Sorry, but when it comes to getting hot seats at hot tables, I'm a mercenary. Ethics, schmethics. What do you think, reader?

Back to the food: got chicken/veggie dumplings as an appetizer (good but skimpy, not the fat stuff you get at an AZN establishment) and \"leg of lamb,\" which came with no bone and looked more like 5 lamb discs/sliders. My friend's salmon, which he remembered as a hearty portion that he couldn't even finish sometimes, now looked like half a salmon steak. Both our veggies were over grilled veggies, in my case asparagus. My friend was shocked at the portion size, and we both agreed that the P2P (price to portions) ratio was unacceptable. Indeed, portions were approaching prix fixe absurdities (the kinds of usually pretentious places where you see more OF THE DISH than a DISH). 

Paul K. (the guy I went with) stared wistfully at the Wisconsin landscape as the sunset. He was less angry than sad that a place he loved for so many years had changed so suddenly and without notice. Was it a new management? A new executive chef? Budget constraints that lead to portion trims as high prices stick? Or perhaps it was all an attempt to become a new type of place: less a spot for the discerning diner than a semi-\"lounge\" type places where expensive drinks and being seen are the priority? Who knows. 

Bonus for the pre-buttered bread. THAT was amazing, but not enough to push this place to a 4."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love Restaurant Week in Madison! Fresco can always be counted on to deliver, and last night was no exception. The view and ambience even in winter is worth the visit. Their cocktail menu always has a few intriguing options on it, and the fall mule I enjoyed (twice) earned a place on my favorites list. For my restaurant week menu selections, I started with crispy Brussels sprouts. If you don't think you are a fan of the sprout, do yourself a favor and try these. \"It's all about how you prepare them\" is totally true. The Russian dressing added a little bit of heat and this course was my favorite part of the meal. Next I had the pan-roasted chicken, which was good but nothing particularly outstanding - although the celeriac puree, roasted broccolini, and bacon beurre blanc left me wanting more. Perfectly seasoned. My only complaint regarding the dish was temperature; I felt like it came to the table warm rather than hot.  Last was the old standby - I've seen these before on their menu and perhaps they are always on - the buttermilk beignets.  A nice little sweet end to a good meal! 
The service was once again excellent. I'll be back again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend."}
{"text":"Utterly disappointed with the level of service.  We called in the early afternoon to reserve 2 for dinner to celebrate a special event.  We were told no reservations were needed and that we would be accommodated with problems.  When we got there at 6:30 pm July 31st, we were informed that Fresco was hosting a private event and was closed for the evening.

This is utterly disgusting that we had to drive for nearly an hr to reach the restaurant having called earlier in the day to be told that a private even was being held.  Are the staff so poorly trained that they can't even get the basics right like informing diners that there's a private event going on and that they would NOT be able to accommodate  us for the evening.  Truly a pathetic experience and the staff, the same one that I spoke to was unapologetic insinuating that it was someone else.  Getting caught in a lie and lying to cover her lies is insulting.

Fortunately, our evening was not wasted as we trek over to Harvest and had a wonderful meal, evening and memories to cherish.  Fresco, you're done!"}
{"text":"I have been to Fresco about 4 times and I was surprised to see that I had never written a review. I think I stopped going there after I retired, as my budget was somewhat tighter than it used to be.

I have a very generous friend who asked me to accompany her to see Steve Martin and Martin Short at Overture. I was super excited and it seemed that the evening deserved some fine dining. It was my pleasure to treat her for dinner.

The space is beautiful. Very avant garde. We arrived just as the clock struck 6 pm. We had a reservation and were immediately seated. We quickly ordered a glass of wine for my friend and a cocktail for me.  Both drinks were excellent. She ordered the Arctic Char and I ordered the Seafood Risotto. The dishes were expertly prepared with subtle flavors, fresh fish, shrimp and scallops and and a little bit of flair. The serving size was just right. We both cleaned our plates. I would be hard-pressed to order anything different in the future.

We did have one significant problem. It was just shy of 7pm (the show started at 7:30)when our food arrived. The waitress kept returning to the table saying our food would be ready in a \"couple of minutes\". Clearly that did not happen. I asked to speak to the manager. He was very apologetic and removed the entrees from the bill. 

If you want a refined and tasty dinner and a 5 minute walk to the theater, there is no better place to go. You must make a reservation on Overture nights and on the weekend. For me, this is a treat but this treat is worth it."}
{"text":"I really liked my visit to Fresco. The ambiance and view of the Capitol (and State Street) is awesome. Love the outside patio, if it was nicer outside I would have loved to enjoy some dinner and drinks out there!

Service was attentive though a bit slow. We started with the crispy Brussels sprouts and the Vietnamese spring rolls. Both were very good. I didn't think I'd enjoy the salmon in the spring rolls (I don't like salmon very much) but all of the flavors tasted delicious together. You get a pretty good portion with your order too. The Brussels sprouts are served with a side or Russian dressing which is always dangerous. On the menu it says they come with bacon however I couldn't find many pieces in our serving. 

For my entree I ordered the whipped burrata and the wine-poached beets. I hate, hate, hate cantaloupe so removed that from my plate immediately. The rest of the dish tasted very good though the toast could have been crispier. The beets were delicious with a perfect amount of beet and goat cheese in each bite! My dinner companions ordered the pan-roasted airline chicken breast and grilled hanger steak and both really liked their meals as well. 

We finished with their buttermilk beignets. No, they weren't as good as you can get in New Orleans but I wasn't mad at them either!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I did. The reviews I read were very good and I looked forward to dining at Fresco. However, my actual experience was not so great. Oh, I was greeted warmly and the wait staff seemed very welcoming and helpful. However, when I received my food, it all went downhill quickly.  I had ordered the chicken and it arrived cool to the touch. The sauce was cold, the chicken was cold, but I was told that the plate was very hot, but in reality, the plate edge was warm but cold food. That led me to believe that perhaps the prepared plate was kept under a heat lamp.  When I mentioned it to the server, she got me a new plate. This new one was warm. Merely warm. The manager came by later and asked me how everything was and I explained my disappointment in the chicken entree temperature.  He said that it was not a hot dish.  I find that comment very odd, who wants to eat cool or lukewarm chicken? In any event, the second plate barely had any sauce on it at all.  In addition, the chicken had some unidentifiable black material on the cut edge (see picture).  The serving size for the chicken was small; Not even the size of a decent chicken breast and it was tough and some of the burnt brown area under the crust was too hard to chew. The waitstaff avoided me for a little while after my dish was replaced and would not come by to refill my water. They eventually came over to inquire about a dessert and they were very gracious.

The hummus appetizer was odd in that they had vegetables all around the rim, except for one place where there was a big gap. It felt as if they were going to put another vegetable on the plate and didn't, or forgot to.  The guacamole was delicious, but only a small smear.

There are many wonderful places to eat in Madison, and this restaurant unfortunately, in my opinion, is not one of them based on my experience."}
{"text":"We had a lackluster experience this past weekend. I wrote the following feedback to their general managers and have yet to receive a response. They don't seem to care about their customers' experiences.

I visited Fresco with my boyfriend and another couple for dinner on Saturday (5/5) night. We love your restaurant and especially love how convenient it is to dine there prior to attending a symphony concert at the Overture. Our friends who were joining us had never been to Fresco before and we were excited for a fun date night together, and chose Fresco as the place.ding 

When I made the reservation, I made sure to note that we were attending the concert at 8 and the maitre'd indicated that should be plenty of time.

I must say, we were very disappointed. Our waitress did as well as she could, but we got the impression that the kitchen staff were having a hard time keeping up with the volume of orders (surprising, considering we'd seen it much busier than that before).

We were seated for dinner at 6, plenty of time for the concert at 8, but our food did not arrive until after 7:30. We felt very rushed, to say the least. Additionally, my salmon was on the colder side, as if it had been sitting for a while before I'd gotten it. The rolls, which are one of our absolute favorite things your restaurant does, were not gooey and warm and doughey when pulled apart, but were hard and dry inside, as if they had been sitting under a lamp for an extended period and made stale. We ordered two rounds of them, hoping the first were a fluke, but were perplexed when they all came out that way. Others around us got dark brown, almost toasted ones that looked like they'd been over-baked. Our friends couldn't understand why we'd raved so much about them ahead of time.

When we finally got the check -- only 10 minutes before 8 -- it was inaccurate and there was absolutely no time to talk to our server and try to get it corrected, which was frustrating because we'd clearly told her what we needed her to do (we had free glasses of wine, for joining the mailing list -- these remained on the bill; and the Museum Member discount we had was not applied). 

All of these things combined made for a much less enjoyable experience than we'd hoped. We hope to return to Fresco again, but we'll likely take a hiatus until we're sure that our next experience won't be like the last one.

Hopefully the feedback provides some suggestions for growth. If you have questions feel free to reach out to me."}
{"text":"Location great, food wonderful and well presented. But when I commented the tonic was bad - the bartender scoffed. Another drink confirmed it was bad. Maybe he was having a bad day but \"customer is always right\". I will be back but many other restaurants more gracious."}
{"text":"The great view from Fresco's dining room combined with the fact that the restaurant sits above the newly opened contemporary art museum makes you feel as though you're in one of the big cities.  The food and wine were excellent, but pricey.  A great place for a date before a show at the Overture Center."}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome view, romantic bar interior. One of the best places I've been to in Madison. Assortment of different American foods, pumpkin soup was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Just killed it tonight. New chef. 

Stopped in for a glass of wine at this rooftop restaurant with great views. Wine list has an excellent selection from around the world. Bartender was knowledgeable and very helpful and offered tastes. 
Asparagus white bean soup with dill, honey and truffle oil was outrageous. If I could marry a soup this one might have been the one I wanted to spend the next thirty years with. (Cha, ya're rilling your eyes but try it before ya judge me...). Great wedge salad - nice light buttermilk dressing. Bread is incomparable.  
Nice folks. Great view. Great food. Thanks for a nice Sunday evening!"}
{"text":"Great view while dining. The sliders are really tasty. My lamb 2 ways was awesome. The cocktails are ok, beer by the bottle only, also just ok, but this place is more of a wine spot. My wife wasn't crazy about he Ciopanna Pasta, but she has a cold, and after we had the creme brûlée (her favorite dessert), and she said this was just ok, I know her taste buds ads affected by the cold. B/c the creme brûlée was one of the best I've ever had. Also check out the children's art work displayed downstairs, also very rad. I recommend Fresco, cheers!"}
{"text":"Dinner at Fresco was a wonderful end to my Madison visit!  We went on a Saturday right before sunset and were immediately seated outside per our request. The views were incredible! We split the tuna tartare and ricotta gnocci. The tartare was delicious! Definitely wished there were more than 3 big taro chips to accompany it but that's fine dining for ya!  The ricotta gnocci was the perfect summer dish and the variety of rare mushrooms used really enhanced the texture. Our waitress didn't even know what one was called (it wasn't listed on the menu description and we originally thought it was a vegetable), but mentioned that they had just gotten that particular type in that day, which was cool.  
It was so difficult narrowing down a drink as all of them sounded amazing. I ended up getting the cuke cooler as I'm a fan of cucumber infused alcoholic drinks, and I was not disappointed.  If only my tolerance was better, I would've gotten the frose and winter in rio to follow! Oh well, guess I'll just have to come back next year :)"}
{"text":"Solid choice in the summertime since you can sit outside and get a good view of state street and potentially the capital. I have never been in the winter season because you can find better food and atmosphere for less money. 

That being said, the food is always good, but it is a little pricey. If you are looking for solid seafood (tough to find in the Midwest in general), then is a solid joint along with the Blue Marlin. The salmon, scallops, and grouper are very well done. Just remember: don't expect to get by on a student's wage for example."}
{"text":"One of the interesting things about dining at Fresco is getting a table next to the kitchen. The smell wafting in from metal-lined window connecting it to the dining room was very reminiscent of a gourmet restaurant I once worked in. And from there, you can see the kind of hard work that goes into making truly high-quality food.

Fresco focuses on smaller dishes that pack in a lot of unusual and potent flavors, rather than the massive portions of average food that many other restaurants offer. The result is that when you try something like the lamb or the salmon, you can practically taste the care that went into getting that perfect sear on the meat. In addition to those, I particularly recommend the flatbread, as it had a unique blend of vegetables and spices on top that made it unlike anything I've ever had. I also remember the bread basically being infused with the essence of butter - easily the best restaurant bread that I've ever eaten.

I ultimately ended up choosing four stars because for the gourmet style that Fresco is going for, it is not the best I've ever eaten. There's not much that makes it stand out; the menu lacks creativity. However, Fresco also offers some of the most affordable prices for food of this caliber that I've ever seen. Revel in the discount gourmet experience. Going to a restaurant like this in Chicago would cost you three times as much."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner as part of our Restaurant Week tour. We have been here before and had fond memories of the food and place. 

Location is superb. Roof top at theMadison Museum of Comtemporary Arts on State St. It was a hot day and a thunderstorm was brewing when we got there so we were seated inside. If you have a choice ask for window seats. As the thunderstorm progressed, we were treated to lightning shows and heavy rain hitting the glass windows. What an evening  

Food was alright. The chicken dumpling was tasty and I love the dumpling skins which were very soft and thin. My dining mate had the spring roll and it had a bitter tasting vegetable in it.  We both had the grilled salmon. Based on previous visits, we thought it would be as good but not so. A tad disappointed. The salmon was too grilled, no pink inside and on the dry side. The accompanying vege was grilled rapini. I like the taste of the charred leaves but the overall bitterness and tough stalks I can pass. Dessert was OK too. She had the creme brûlée and I had the beignets balls. The creme brûlée was too firm. Tasted more like custard but the lavender flavor was really good. The beignets balls were ordinary. I thought it was going to be puffy like the beignets I had in New Orleans."}
{"text":"All I can say is Lovely. Wonderful staff. One of the best places to go in Madison on any occasion. Barb"}
{"text":"Fresco is a  boutique restaurant on top of the famous MMoCA. It's located in a prime spot on state street with an outdoor rooftop patio for good drinks and view.

I went there for restaurant week with a good friend. The atmosphere is actually somewhat romantic. It's cozy, great lighting, simple and chic. There is also a bar area for people who want to come here for drinks and or waiting for a table.

The food was done well. I tried the brussel sprouts appetizer and the pork loin entrée. We were also given a nice basket of soft and buttery warm bread. They have a good drinks list with a wide selection of wine and cocktails. 

Price and portions were decent, it's definitely a good option for a date or a lovely someone to share an intimate time!"}
{"text":"This place is in the strip mall next to Target and Basha's.  It's kinda hard to spot so be patient and drive slowly to spot it.  The interior is really cute and it was pretty busy when we went around 9pm on Sat.  It is Korean owned and they are very friendly.  We ordered the 3 topping single bingsoo and milk tea with boba.  The frozen yogurt in the bingsoo was very yummy...it actually tasted like ice cream...really, it was good.  Boba on the other hand was horrible....I should have known when I saw other people ordering exclusively bingsoo but I couldn't help it.  I was curious to see if this place can be better than The Street.  

*Service = really nice
*Decor = cute
*Food = boba was horrible...believe me they were hard, tasteless, and starchy.
If you are still contemplating what to order after reading this review...let me make it clear + simple for you:
                      Bingsoo = GOOD GOOD GOOD
                      Boba = BAD BAD BAD"}
{"text":"During the summertime I live on bingsoo. In fact, during the wintertime I live on bingsoo as well. Because it's that damn good. Everyone here is super friendly too. That may be because I come in 3 times a week though. You can even get a little frequent buyers punch card and after your 10th bingsoo or whatever you get you get a free one. Awwwee yeeahh. I've heard that the bingsoo they serve here isn't \"authentic\", but who cares - it's to die for."}
{"text":"Terrific!  The flavors of the salads and entrees were incredible.  Just the right ambiance before heading on to an evening at the theatre."}
{"text":"I dined at Fresco March 9th and when I got home, I wrote an email to them which went unanswered until I sent it to a couple different addresses at Food Fight because it was \"in the spam folder\" (I have heard they aren't always so quick to respond to their emails). I went home starving and ate a box of cookies. As a vegetarian/vegan there are only so many salads you can eat, the wait person also said we could get risotto, but that never showed up on the plate...Of course after sending it to Food Fight, Fresco responded and it was a pretty general we're sorry please consider us in the future type of thing.


Vegans beware.

Here's the email I sent to Fresco:
 
I just wanted to write about my experience dining at your establishment tonight. I was part of a large party celebrating my friend's bachelorette party. I called around Feb 12th to verify if there was any possible way anything from the menu could be made vegan. I was lead to believe by the wonderful person I spoke with on the phone that many vegans have dined with you and they would put a note in the party reservation and it sounded like an entree would be made specially for vegans and that any other vegans in the party should call and have a note added so there was an idea how many vegans would be dining that night. I advised my friend to call and get it added, but she called today and was told to just tell the wait staff that we were vegan and order off the menu. 

I placed my order and was surprised how minimal it was. There were sautéed carrots and peas,  3 pieces of brussels sprouts, 3-4 pieces of green zucchini, 3 tiny pieces of mushrooms, and a couple red potatoes with seasoning and a pinch of greens on top. I understand this is higher end dining, but I was appalled at the cost vs what I received. I am floored by the 1-1.5 cup of food that was on my plate at the $17 cost. 

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to try your restaurant, but you have pretty much sealed the deal with me never setting foot there again, nor recommending it to anyone in the future."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about this rooftop restaurant and I am happy to say that I have finally made an appearance! Located above Overture Center, you can see out to the Capitol or down below to the long lines at the Orpheum before the show. I was there just before they screened a movie, I need to go back purposely for that! My friends had some cocktails that looked delicious. I enjoyed the food, but as I've learned from past experience - the more expensive the meal, the smaller the portion sizes (I guess it's harder to mess up when there's less?).

Also, those stairs to get to the top are a bit daunting... though, don't chicken out by taking the elevator. A little exercise goes a long way!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here recently on a visit to Madison. The ambience was very unique with a distinctly modern flair. The view of Madison you have while dining adds to the sophistication of the experience.

The food was contemporary American cuisine, and the menu was rotating/seasonal. The butternut squash soup was excellent. Drinks were great, too.

My only complaint is that my vegetarian gnocchi and the herb cream sauce were too rich. I wasn't able to finish it. But other than that, good restaurant, interesting atmosphere. I will just order a different entree when I return."}
{"text":"What is bingsoo? well, here's how it went down

you select 3 fresh fruits
1 fruit puree
yogurt or icecream (the yogurt isn't tart and what they recommend, it's sweet and delicious) 

then they take a bowl, put in shaved ice, the yogurt/ice cream, the fruits, and puree. you mix it all together and enjoy.

my recommendation is to ask for light to medium ice shavings, mine got a bit too cold and it started to numb all of the flavors. but i enjoy the texture from the ice so it's definitely a must. 

allll of this for less than $5!!! any other yogurt place would cost you much more for all of these fresh ingredients, even extra toppings are only $.25

the guy who was working was very sweet, great place. i cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Perched atop the museum of contemporary art in Madison, this hidden gem can boast fantastic food, service and views.

If you're not looking for it, you might miss this restaurant as it is up on the top floor of the museum.  There are windows all around to enjoy sunsets and glimpses of the capitol building lit up at night.  In the summer, an outdoor terrace would be perfect for drinks and appetizers.

A nice selection of wines by the glass, and a tempting menu of cocktails are a nice way to kick off the meal.  The scallops to start were tender and flavorful, and the lamb two-ways for my main - what could be better?

Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came for the first time for restaurant week and really enjoyed my time! It's a classy, modern, but not too fancy establishment. The large windows all around made the small space seem a bit bigger, even if it was dark and cold outside. Service was fine, although they did say that the whole table needed to choose between either restaurant week or their regular menu. So on to the food - I split everything with my boyfriend so I could cover 2/3 of the restaurant week menu :) 

Appetizer: The arugula fennel salad was nice and light, not very substantial but the truffle vinaigrette was delicious. The brussel sprouts were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft in the center, and came with a sweet tangy cherry sauce. The sauce was okay but honestly I liked the brussel sprouts better without. 

Entree: My braised short rib was my favorite item of the night! The meat was so fall-apart tender and flavorful. The polenta and beets that it came with were not very flavorful and I may have preferred just more meat but I guess it was good that they added some different textures in there. The salmon was also quite flavorful and I liked the poached apples it came with. 

Dessert: I got honey rosemary creme brulee, which I loved, but I'm also a sucker for custardy desserts so I may be biased. Didn't taste much of the rosemary, but the rest of it was just the right amount of sweetness, with a nice layer of crunchy caramelized sugar, and the custard was a bit softer than other creme brulees I've had which was fine by me. My boyfriend got buttermilk beignets, which were more like spherical funnel cakes, as he called them, than the airy puff that usually comes to mind. However, they were warm, buttery, and still very yummy. 

Hopefully I'll get a chance to come back when it's nicer outside and try their regular menu items!"}
{"text":"Another decent, seasonally menu-changing restaurant. Very chic and slick looking interior, and decked with modern decor. Fresco presents its guests with a lively and upbeat atmosphere.

The food is good, but I think I generally expect more from Fresco. There's not a lot of variety in their menu, and sometimes seems rather plain. I've had their salmon and steak dishes. Not amazing, not bad. I do recall one of their risotto dishes being quite tasty.

I think the bar area makes the place a little better, but as a whole, Fresco is A-OK."}
{"text":"Enjoyed pre-theater dinner on March 6. I had the seared tuna salad, and I tell you, it was off the charts! Perfectly seared tuna on a bed of fresh greens, with mushrooms, almonds, hard-boiled eggs, kalamata olives, grilled potato, black sheep truffle cheese and champagne vinaigrette. I was nervous to order a salad because I didn't think it would be filling enough, but it was perfection.

I also tried my husband's entree, which was their house made ricotta cheese gnocchi. That night's special sauce was bacon truffle. It was rich and wonderful!

The service was not as expected for such great food and ambiance. The server was friendly and helpful with the menu, but was not on top of her game. I asked to keep the wine list at the table so I could choose my wine prior to dinner arriving and then she walked off with it, never to return. After our food was delivered by another server I asked for the wine list and the person asked me what kind I thought I'd want. When I said Cabernet, she quickly said we only have one that comes by the glass and left to fetch it before I could tell her I still wanted to look at the menu. She was in a huge hurry to grab the wine, but it didn't arrive until I was nearly finished with my meal, at which point I was not particularly interested in drinking it."}
{"text":"For $25 a meal for Sunday brunch, I was very disappointed. Mostly, the service pretty much sucked. The brunch is a fixed price and you get two drinks, these little donuts, and an entree. My boyfriend got a burger and I got a quiche. The crust of the quiche was burnt and the egg of it was overcooked not fluffy. One of the friends with us was brought burnt toast. It was black, on both sides. 

I ordered a Diet Coke and it was definitely not Diet Coke, it tasted like flavored water... how do you mess up Diet Coke? 

According to the menu each meal gets an appetizer of shareable \"powdered donuts.\" The donuts didn't come out until our food was brought out and for a table of 6 people there were 5 donuts holes and no more were offered. They tasted great, but we all paid for our own shareable donuts, and they didn't even bring enough for us each to have one. They were very good though, and the only reason this place gets two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"The view is gorgeous! I loved looking at the new Orpheum sign as I sipped my Frosé and snacked on appetizers. We tried the  brussel sprouts and the fried chickpea hummus both were delicious! For two drinks and two appetizers we spent 40 with tip. I would definitely recommend popping up there to try their cocktails, appetizers and check out the awesome views!"}
{"text":"Fresco was definitely the place to end Restaurant Week!

Wild Mushroom Risotto Cake- 5 out of 5 stars
Crispy, flavorful, and hearty, left me wanting more. The Brie on top was an added bonus. 

Chilled Corn Chowder- 4 out of 5 stars
Tea party serving of chilled corn chowder with copious amounts of crab and bacon. This delightful appetizer was very refreshing, light, and meaty for a summer evening. A very calm and gracious start to a three course meal. I think this dish might have been better served warm. 

Grilled Salmon- 5 out of 5 stars
A marvelously plated fish. Laid upon a bed of buttermilk risotto, and topped with a sweet onion jam. The risotto was balanced with snap peas, carrots, and cherry tomatoes for a nice fresh taste. The salmon was cooked to perfection and came apart delicately with a fork. Good fish and risotto that was baby bear quality, just right. 

Sake Braised Crispy Pork Belly- 3 out of 5 stars
Exotic plate of pork and vegetables. The pickled carrots were the bomb. The bok choy and squash was pretty good too. The veggies were spiced and seasoned well and danced on your tongue. A bit heavy on the teriyaki sauce, which drowned out the pork's full flavor. 

Fresco Trio- 3 out of 5 stars
Interesting combination of peach crumble, ruby port sorbet, and corn pot de creme. It was a nice variety and opportunity to taste these desserts, but none really had that wow factor. The crumble was good on the peach crumble. The ruby port sorbet was very sugary, but you couldn't actually taste the port until it started to warm up and melt. The corn pot de creme was interesting and odd. Again, just fun to try. 

House Made Ice Cream Sandwich- 4 out of 5
Peanut butter cookies sandwiched a mound of chocolate mousse. Very rich and satisfying in flavor. The sandwich itself was a bit awkward to eat due to its height. Tried to ungracefully break it down with a fork and knife, the waiter offered to bring a steak knife over to cut it. 

Our waiter, Jon, was incredible. He could read our minds. He could tell I wasn't in love with my drink even though I said it was fine, and was persistent in asking and replaced the drink. Each course of the meal came speedily out of the kitchen. The ambiance was lovely, fresh flowers, a candle, darker lighting, wonderful window views, and neat modern red plates that held the dining plates. Only suggestion would be to get higher quality coasters, my water glass continuously sweat and got stuck. 

After dining went and explored the rooftop area. Nice artwork all about and a pretty view of state street."}
{"text":"We checked out Fresco for the first time for my birthday, and it did not disappoint! I loved the ambiance and how most of the light in the place was coming from the Orpheum sign across the street. The patio is beautiful, so I know I will need to make another trip in the summer...lots of bold patrons were braving the frigid temps in their party dresses to get pictures outside. We started with the crispy Brussel sprouts for an appetizer and they were amazing - brussels and bacon are a match made in heaven, and the app came with a dipping sauce that was mouth watering. My husband and I both had the seared scallops - the plate they brought out was a work of art in and of itself.  I'm not going to lie - I looked at it at first, and was like 'Is that going to fill me up?' but it did...the scallops were melt in your mouth tender, and the flavors were out of this world. Every element was meant to be together, from the grilled corn to the cherry tomatoes - I'm seriously drooling just thinking about it again. I sipped on one of their specialty drinks, the b-hive (barreled gin, honey syrup, lemon, up) the entire meal, and then enjoyed a cup of coffee with my birthday dessert (flourless chocolate cake). I wish I had snapped some pictures, but this is the type of place where I felt a little silly busting my camera out to take pictures of the food...it just felt like a night to just take in and sear into my memory, a rare treat!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for glam in the heart of historic Madison - ascend to Fresco. Located in the Madison Contemporary Museum of Art, climb the glass staircase to your right. If you have time, stop into an exhibit on your way up - it's free. Fresco is at the top. 

Modern ambiance - both indoor & outdoor dining. I prefer outdoor to enjoy their rooftop garden and a wonderful view of downtown.

New American fare (sample menus + drink lists on their website, including gluten free), an extensive wine list, 8 kinds of bottled beer + 1 non-alcoholic, specialty cocktails. 

My friend and I stopped by for a quick bite and had their crab cakes. They were amazing! Best I've had so far, packed full of wonderful flavors (see photos) and presented beautifully.

A great place to bring a date or hang out with friends."}
{"text":"This is the place to \"treat yo self.\" Be prepared to spend a pretty penny on amazing apps, drinks, and entrees. I'm a vegetarian so the menu options are limited, but it's worth it for the appetizers and booze! 
If it isn't reserved for a wedding, event, etc. make sure to check out the rooftop views!"}
{"text":"I had a totally solid dining experience here during restaurant week.  The atmosphere is nice and I bet it'd be beautiful on a warm summer evening to sit outside with the view of the Capitol.  The food was good, but I was hoping for a bit more originality.  I loved the option to have a half glass of wine so I could try two different types without having to drink 2 glasses.  Overall I will likely be back on an evening where the view and outdoor area could be enjoyed."}
{"text":"I traveled to Madison for work and came to Fresco on the advice of a coworker.  I am SO glad I did.  This place is hands down the BEST place I've EVER eaten at (and that's saying a lot seeing as I grew up in the Bay Area- San Francisco).  There food is farm fresh and you can definitely taste it.  I had the strawberry basil mojito (which tasted so fresh and had no artificial or syrup-like taste).  For the appetizer, I had the Kind Edwards mussels...it was so delicious that I drank the wine sauce it came in! (after running out of bread to soak up the sauce with).  I order the lamb which literally melted in my mouth- it was cooked to PERFECTION.  Then I had the strawberry creme brulee which had a perfectly crunchy top and could be described as smooth and having the perfect consistency.  I also had the riesling (which was also delicious) for my dessert wine.  I think I now have a favorite restaurant!  Now I just need to devise a plan to have my work send me over here for training more often or else I'll end up traveling 2000+ miles just to eat here on my own dime!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and some great views... I'm not sure I would go so far as to say 'great' food. There are some very tasty selections like the pork belly and some very average selections like the salmon... For what you get it's a little on the pricey side... This is definitely a restaurant to experience maybe once or twice a year...."}
{"text":"Indifferent service, overcooked, oversalted entree. Overpriced. The ricotta gnocchi  was just a soggy mess. They weren't that busy, and it was early in the evening, so  not sure why the entree was overcooked."}
{"text":"If you've never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out. I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place. I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house. If you've never heard of it, this is how it goes down. It's a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of \"sauce\" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey. You mix it all together and there you have it. A somewhat healthy dessert! They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =) 

This place isn't just all about the bingsoo though. They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a date night last night. It was our second time dining at Fresco, the first time being a few years ago. We had made a 5:00 reservation, so we were the first to arrive. We were given a seat right by the window, with a beautiful view of the Capitol and Orpheum. It was perfect! I had the risotto gnocchi and my husband ordered the tenderloin. For an appetizer we chose the arancini. Everything was delicious. The wine was equally amazing. Both times we dined here, we came in the winter. I'm excited to come back during summer to eat on the patio."}
{"text":"Fresco has been one of my favorite restaurants in Madison for a while and even a restaurant I've chosen for celebrating special events, like birthdays and wedding anniversary dinners. 

I've never had a bad meal at Fresco. The appetizers and entrees are all delicious, perfectly cooked and well-thought out. The usual food items that should always be fresh and not frozen -- like scallops and salmon -- are always fresh when I order them at Fresco. I like that a partial view of the kitchen is available at Fresco, too!

On my most recent trip, though, the red glass chargers on the tables were missing. When I think of Fresco, I always think of those red glass chargers on the tables! I was a little bummed to see that they were no longer placed on the tables."}
{"text":"First off we didn't have a reservation, we didn't even know the place existed. We decided to try it out. We had a party 10. I know who doesn't make reservations for a party of 10 right? Well everyone had different plans and at the last minute we decided to do Fresco. We went upstairs and went outside after notifying the hostess who seemed to have had better things to do. We admired the rooftop garden area then sat down at a table. They took our orders and left us to converse. It then began to rain... No big deal it's a Sunday afternoon at 3 PM how busy could the inside be? Well there were two tables occupied so we thought it shouldn't be a big deal for us to take a table. We notified the hostess and waitress that it was raining outside and we wanted to sit inside. They said ok but we don't have much time since we have alot of people coming in tonight who have reserved tables. We enjoyed a few akward faces from the hostess who was pissed because we took a table without reservations. Sorry people it's called customer service, roll with the punches. Our bill was $347.xx seemed a bit high but whatever, everyone enjoyed there food for the most part and drinks were pretty good. Prices for the portion size did seem a little high. Maybe offer a little more for the money?"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant. The atmosphere is IKEA-like. The brussel sprout appetizer was delicious and was a good portion size. I enjoy that the menu is seasonal. Our server was kind and accommodating. Only 4 stars because we stood at the host stand, in front of the hostess, for 2 minutes before she acknowledged us. She was busy looking at her seating chart and talking with a manager. I would have preferred for them to turn to us and say, \"Hi, I will be right with you.\" Not the best first impression but the rest of the experience made up for it."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this:  I used to work for Fresco as a bartender, and even after moving on, I still have to come back at least once every few months to eat.  I love the service and the delicious menu.  They have a great wine list, including well priced bottles (Layer Cake Shiraz is my fav).  

This is the perfect romantic date for the summer OR winter.  Even if you have to sit inside, the view and the atmosphere are intimate and refreshing.  

They have a late night bar menu consisting of $5 specialty drinks and cheap upscale appetizers.  When working there, I noticed the patrons to be a mix of East coast college students and middle to upper class 30-40 somethings.  

Either way, I suggest giving it at least one chance to see if it's your scene.
The seared sashimi scallops are always an excellent choice for an appetizer.  Past there, I recommend trying whatever is newest and freshest locally on their menu."}
{"text":"I went for a work dinner and while I liked everything, I expected better.

As a starter I had the flat bread with the confit duck, the duck was good, the pear were a tad too sweet and most importantly the bread itself tasted a bit stale.
Then I had the short ribs with the polenta. The short rib was delicious, but the polenta was a tad too sweet and the vegetables bland and too crunchy.
The lemon cheesecake was good, but nothing memorable and not lemon-y enough form me.
Now food was still good and what I am complaining about is mostly nitpicking but from a restaurant of this caliber I would expect perfection.

What was really good was the wine and the space. View is great and the building is guaranteed to make an impression!

I would still bring people here on work occasions because of the location and as I said the food was OK, but not for impressing a foodie."}
{"text":"On the Saturday night we were here the outdoor area was closed because of the storms that were going through. Indoors is nice but we would have preferred to eat outside. My foursome all had something from the restaurant week menu and it was ok but not great. I guess average would be my rating on the chicken dish I had. I couldn't remember it ten minutes after eating it to give you the idea! The service was very good and  professional. A wedding was booked for the outside that night and since it was closed they were moved to the  entrance on the street level. Rather than fight our way though to the elevator and chance being forced on the dance floor by the party goers we hoofed it up the stairs and found out how far three sets of stairs can be. Us baby boomers don't need that kind of exercise without an EMS truck just outside but we all managed it. Great view of the new Orpheum sign which is very close to the windows or garden area."}
{"text":"Fresco wasn't the easiest place to find for an out-of-towner.  However, I did like the style when I did make it in!  I went later in the evening (within an hour of closing) so maybe that explains the attitude of the bartender.  I did not feel very welcomed, the bartender wasn't helpful in ordering, or suggesting anything.  He acted like he didn't want to be bothered. I went alone, and I was in and out before the place closed -- so his attitude was unwarranted... and there was kind of an odd smell to the place.  However, the food turned was great and I enjoyed it very much.  And a manager came and spoke to me to ask how my food was, and was very friendly and kind.  I really didn't want to throw the bartender under the bus at the time, though, because he was standing nearby.  I would consider and returning to try it again, but I'd hope next time the service is a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Went on a double date and when we wanted a dessert place with a view, we opted for Fresco. While the view can't be beat, the dessert menu was a little meh. I had the flourless chocolate cake which was little more than six very small brownies served with drops of the fancy reduction mentioned on the menu. Two of our party got the blueberry crumble which would have been better described as blueberry crunch - it was much more the consistency of a peanut brittle than a traditional crumble. 

I don't mind food innovation and experimentation, but if a chef is going to do that, I think it would be better not to use words that already have deep food connotations and expectations."}
{"text":"A great date-night destination. Nice view, hip room, and good service. The food is on the pricey side though portions aren't bad. 

The cheddar risotto cake has stood up as 'good' two times. Something keeps it from being great though, perhaps a lack of additional sauce or a nibble on the side? Potato leek soup is very good but was served lukewarm both times. Perhaps that's how it's served but I like my soup hot and I don't think that's being picky. The panko-crusted salmon is a wonderful simple dish that could potentially be prepared at home. It manages to be very good yet misses 'impressive'. That said, I'd eat it again and again. Their gnocchi is great, I just wish there was more per serving, but this is a pretty regular occurrence with handmade pasta at any restaurant. 

If prices were a little lower here I'd give it 5 stars. You're paying to eat on top of the museum and for the fancy room, but the food is basically just solid and tasty homestyle fare with a few flairs. Indeed it's a strength of the restaurant that it manages to avoid pretense in spite of its surroundings."}
{"text":"Been planning to come here for a long time and finally got a chance to do so recently. This place impressed me and is officially on the top of our restaurant list.

Service was beyond expectations. View from the corner of the restaurant against the windows was great. Food was FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!

1. Gnocchi -- brown butter, pesto, and a tomato sauce (three separate dishes). Our favorite was the brown butter pesto....we like creamy and it definitely satisfied.

2. prince edward island mussels -- (parmesan-bacon fondue, potato, grilled bread) OK, seriously? That parmesan-bacon fondue was a nice touch to the usual \"fishy\" taste mussels can have sometimes. Perfect combination and using the fondue as a bread dip is very tasty as well.

3. dry aged new york strip -- (roasted garlic mashed potato, shaved brussel sprouts,
hook's blue paradise cheese, bacon, herb compound butter) Bf had this plate; he enjoyed it and I got a chance to taste the side dish of the shaved brussel sprouts with bacon. It's got BACON. I can eat a full meal with just that side dish. 

4. cioppino pasta -- (scallops, shrimp, mussels, mahi-mahi, salmon, clams, linguine, spiced tomato broth, parmesan cheese, grilled bread) Seafood galore! Tasted even better the next day at work.

5. buttermilk beignets -- (milk chocolate center, vanilla crème anglaise) Perfect way to end the meal. Nice crisp to the beignets. 

Salivating. The end!"}
{"text":"Great date night spot! Great views, amazing food, all around romantic place to visit!"}
{"text":"Three words to sum up my thoughts on Fresco: phenomenal dining experience! The menu is made up of local, fresh produce so their menu is seasonal and changes based on what is available. My family came with a group of 7 and they were able to seat us without a reservation within 40 minutes on a Friday night. They have an outdoor lounge area where we waited with some drinks, which was perfect while looking over the menu. 

Once we were seated, we ordered our food, appetizers and more drinks. The manager stopped by several times to ensure we were happy which I appreciated. There was a bit of a wait on the entrees but, to be fair, they were busy and we had a large group with varying orders. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt as the food was amazing! I ordered the scallops and others went with the rack of lamb, ribeye steak, risotto gnocchi and seared halibut. We started with the fried artichokes and Brussels sprouts which were perfect to share. The bacon in the Brussel sprouts dish was flavorful and crispy--I'm still dreaming about it :) I was able to sample everyone else's dish and I have to say I believe my scallops were the best! They had a nice crust on them, they were huge and paired nicely with fresh vegetables. 

Afterwards, we ordered some desserts. My favorite was the flourless chocolate cake. I was expecting a thick and condensed cake but I was pleasantly surprised it was light, airy and moist! I also sampled the blueberry crumble and beignets and their s'mores ice cream, but preferred mine over the rest. If you're a s'mores fan and like the smokey and campfire-y taste, try out their ice cream! 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Fresco! This was a wonderful way to spend time with family and not feel so rushed to leave, though it took awhile to get the entrees out. Our server was nice thought she forgot a few things, but quickly fixed it when we brought it to her attention. And lastly, the view from the outdoor rooftop seating is amazing! I also appreciate the ambiance as it was the perfect seating for a family dinner. Highly recommend Fresco if you're looking for a quality and unique dining experience in Madison, WI!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my absolute favorite places to go during a Madison summer. The rooftop view is beautiful and the food is just as pretty. The strawberry sangria is delicious and refreshing, but it was honestly so hard to choose from all the amazing sounding cocktails! Every entree I've had here has been tasty, my halibut this time around was tender and well seasoned. Don't forget to save room for dessert! The beignets are freaking awesome (not pictured because we ate them too quickly)"}
{"text":"Came for a birthday dinner while I was traveling in Madison. Really lovely space with the right ambiance: lighting not too dim and without loud music so you could actually hear. Great service from start to finish.

 I had the following:

creamy potato soup: great way to start a meal in this wintry weather. Not overly creamy and not overly dressed with finishing oils. Bacon bits were a good touch, but I think they could have done something more to pull out the flavor.

short rib: recommended by my server as the best dish of the entrees for this current seasonal menu. You can taste the 6-hour cook time, and it really is an ample portion size. Lots of veggies to go with it and sauce. The truffle creme fraiche really sealed the deal.

Would love to come back whenever I return for a visit. Never would have expected a restaurant at the rooftop of the museum."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Fresco for a long and finally had the chance to do so last weekend on a beautiful spring night.  The roof deck is awesome....very spacious, unique, and great views.  We did not eat anything but the pitchers of sangria were the perfect compliment to the night.  I will be back in the future for the food!"}
{"text":"Great surprise beautiful setting. Great staff. Will defiantly return here. The tartare was fantastic. The drink of the day was so fun. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and the view. Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"I was here in early February with a group of 20 people.  The service was great, the food was wonderful and everyone had a great time.  The view is beautiful as well"}
{"text":"Technically named Fresco Juice, anyone-who- is-anyone simply knows the place as \"BingSoo.\" A small, simple spot in an inauspicious Chandler strip-mall, Fresco's has the corner on the BingSoo market in the Phoenix area. Come to think of it, I don't think there even is another BingSoo place in Phoenix... But if there was, Fresco could beat them blindfolded and with it's hands tied behind it's back. 

What?? You've never heard of BingSoo? Then friend, you are in for a better-than-sex (sorry, honey) taste sensation. BingSoo is an Asian-inspired dessert made of shaved ice, your choice of fresh sliced fruits and fruit sauces, and frozen yogurt or ice cream on the top. Fresco's sports a Starbuck's-style ambience, plus the Korean music videos projected on the wall. The sandwiches are fresh although nothing too spectacular, but the quality of the BingSoo alone deserves the 5-star rating."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why some of the reviewers here are all up in arms about the food quality.  I thought the food was excellent!  It was by no means the greatest meal I've ever had, but it was delicious.

The boy and I got to sit out outside and take in the (COMPLETELY STUNNING) view.  Since it was sunset-time, we got to see the Capitol building light up and be all breathtakingly gorgeous and what have you.  Yes, you do mostly pay for the views at Fresco, but it was worth it.

Our adorable and wonderful spiky-haired waitress gave us all the time we needed to pick drinks from their extensive menu.   I tried the pear-lemon martini (which tasted just like an alcoholic pear-flavored Jelly Belly).  The boy tried the blueberry-thyme cocktail, which he didn't care for, but I thought it was tasty (it has a lot of club soda, which is why he didn't like it).  Also, they have the greatest free bread EVER.  It's like a warm pull-apart dinner roll with butter and pretzel salt on top!  *drool*

I tried the \"lamb lollipop chops\" entree, and the boy got the salmon.  Both were really, really tasty.  He thought the salad that accompanied his salmon was too salty, due to an excess of feta, but it was still edible.  I had no complaints whatsoever about my entree or the awesome salad that came with it.

We were then beguiled by the dessert menu.  We tried the chocolate beignets.  The waitress informed us that it would take 10-15 minutes, was that alright?  Heck yeah, woman!  This view can't be beat!  Take all the time you need!  The beignets were brought out, piping hot, full of oozing chocolatey goodness and a saucer of creme anglaise.  The boy almost licked out the bowl of creme anglaise.  The beignets were really phenomenal, and I highly recommend trying them.

All said, dinner was $70 before a tip.  Expensive?  Yes.  Worth it?  Probably, yes.  I certainly don't regret it!"}
{"text":"Fresco is my new favorite summer spot! This spot reminds me of a certain restaurant that used to sit atop the Graduate Hotel. Same open air, coastal, fusion of casual and fancy vibes but with much better food and service. That restaurant has since closed, but Fresco feels like a reincarnation with a destiny to outperform its competitors. Though, in all actuality, what beats a rooftop dining experience: very few things, if you ask me. Let your mood be lifted, your appetite be sated, and your thirst be quenched with their fabulous fare. Here are some suggestions I've collected from just one visit to Fresco: 

1) Are you vegan? Do the brussels sprouts! I'm told the accompanying Russian dressing is dairy free. Not into brussels? The hummus plate was not only a marvel to behold, but also a treat to eat. 

2) On the lookout for a dazzlingly refreshing summer drink? Fresco's Frose is just what the doctor ordered. I'm told they've been tweaking their recipe, so your first frose might be different from the next, but I'm confident you'll be satisfied each time. :-) 

3) I didn't get a chance to try out the Crispy Salmon, but I did catch a glimpse of it. It looked so pretty, and the patron's facial expressions during and after eating it lead me to believe it was a full on culinary success.   

Crossing my fingers Fresco is here to stay!"}
{"text":"OMG!  I am a boba addict.  When I read about Fresco here on Yelp! and saw how close it was to my home, I just had to try it.  I went there and ordered the Bingsoo.  

I asked the gentleman behind the counter if he suggested yogurt or ice cream, and he said yogurt.  I'm not a huge fan of exotic fruits (or berries for that matter) and he told me I could choose 3 fruits and one fruit sauce.  Being the boring fruit eater that I am, I chose banana and double pineapple with strawberry sauce.  And, of course BOBA.  

I asked him if there was a specific way to eat it and he told me to mix it all up.  I did and was in heaven from the first bite.  It was amazingly refreshing, as well as just downright delish.  I will be visiting this place regularly on the weekends for a bingsoo fix, but this morning I will try their milk tea with, of course ... BOBA!

I HIGHLY recommend this place.  5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We went there on a recommendation because I was looking for fabulous Gnocci. The gnocci was tough and chewy which made me quite sad.

On the other hand, the room was nice, the waiter was nice, the hostess just fine, the scallop appetizer was really very good. Our cocktails were of the super-hip \"we like to be non-traditional and add weird stuff to them\" style. Sometimes that is tragic but they turned out well, I would suggest the chipotle margarita for a little kick of something different. My friend said the lamp pops were really very good and the little beignets for dessert were fine. Just not fabulous.

I actually sent the gnocci back after my companion tried them and agreed that they were not good. I told the waiter I was vegetarian and he offered me a vegetarian risotto, I said fine and it turned out to be vegan so no cheese like a normal risotto. It was bland but OK. When we got the bill the gnocci was still on it but the waiter fixed it. By 9 or so it kind of turned into a hip bar type atmosphere.

Would I go back? Nope. Given all the amazing food Madison has to offer spending $100 on two entrees, 2 drinks, one appetizer and one dessert is fine, but it should be pretty fabulous. It wasn't."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was lovely and the chocolate mousse was decadent and satisfying!"}
{"text":"Went back again on two subsequent Scottsdale trips. It doesn't matter how far we have to drive, who we can get to go with us, we are going here. And this place never lets us down. The boba pearls on my BingSoo are perfect. The fruit is SOOO fresh. And now they know that Travis buck and one of the players from the Dodgers come here and proudly display their autographed ball caps. I love this place and will make a special trip out here every time we go!"}
{"text":"Maybe 2 1/2.  

I tried Fresco on two separate occasions this summer for the Fresco Fives -- perfect for grad students who want nice dining and drinks but can't afford the full menu.  But why?  Why on earth do they close so early!?  The last hour of the day, Fresco offers a $5 menu with a limited (very limited and even more limited on my second visit!) selection of wine, martinis, and small plates.  I had the scallops, tuna, lamb \"sliders\", and mushroom and leek tartlet.  The tuna is good and packed with flavorful fried capers but I like my sashimi thick!  The lamb sliders were, well, a bit weird.  The beet flavor threw me off but hey, I like beets.  The mushroom and leek tartlet is a bit bland but the scallops?  Awesome!  Can't go wrong with Nueske's bacon!  Before I ordered I made sure to check that they were flown in that day, fresh as possible for Madison.  They were and they *were* delicious!   The $5 wine selection is okay but the view is fantastic.  My dining partner had a refreshing but potent 50/50 martini.  Pass on certain desserts -- the honey-poached pear brulee was substandard with a weird aftertaste.  The thought of Fresco Fives in the winter is much less appealing to me.    To sum it up, any future visit might involve two plates of bacon wrapped scallops, a glass of wine or a martini, a view, and moving on to better things at the Tornado Room or other alternative late night menus.

PS  A friend of mine has raved about  the lamb lollipop chops."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week with my girlfriend so we made sure to not get the same thing for any of the courses.. 

To begin, appetizer:
Risotto cakes and potato soup. Both were very good. Lots of flavor. Both of us enjoyed the cakes aka little risotto balls more.

Entree:
I had the braised beef with mini potatoes, onions and carrots with creme fraiche. She had the salmon with crab and bacon polenta. Both were good but the braised beef was amazing! So yummy, I found myself wiping the bowl with my fork to get more sauce.

Desert;
I had the chocolate mousse and she had the berry cheesecake. Both of us agreed the mousse was the better of the two.

Overall, awesome restaurant with good food and good service. Great place to go for date night. My only gripe is that I specifically made a reservation for 845 on a Friday night during restaurant week. When we arrived 10 minutes early, they told me the owner of the overture center took my table and I had to wait till 915 to finally be seated. Not too happy but between food and service, Fresco still gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork sliders and pea/risotto cakes were fantastic as are the little rolls that they bring to the table. 
I had the strip steak. It was over-salted as was the accompanying basil dijonnaise sauce. I tasted a friend's salmon dish which was fantastic. 
Dessert - choc. cake with peanut butter mousse was just ok. Good idea, but no wow factor. 
Decent table service. We, a table of 9, sometimes waited for refills of cocktails or water, but...for the most part...the service and timing were good."}
{"text":"love the decor here.  The rooftop patio is bomb.  Grab a drink the blackberry old fashioned was the unique and tasty.  They have good happy hours & such.  I only tried an appetizer but it was delish.  Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We went here for date night and everything was delicious! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fresco several times and I have that each visit the food is consistently good. Definitely try the Brussels sprouts and the burrata cheese appetizers. Decent wine collection as well. But the best part of the restaurant is definitely the view of downtown Madison. Try and get a window seat if you can and go around dusk and see the magic hour of the city."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars

Overhyped for what I considerd to be barely Fine Dining. We went for their New Yea's Eve Dinner (Prix Fix Menu - $50 pp). The ambiance was more clubby than elegant. To our shock, the tables were almost brushing shoulders with bar stools, thus making the whole place a drunken laughter charade! Not what you expect when you want a romantic dinner with your loved one.

The food on its own was OK with nothing really shining out. The appetizer round had \"1\" Scallop!! It's like a slap on your face for not shelling out more money and going to a \"Proper\" Fine Dining place. My Halibut Entree had the fish overcooked to a rather tough consistency. My wife's lamp chops were fine. They had a meager 3 options for Dessert, of which they ran out of Creme Brulee. Great!, talk about making compromises AFTER getting limited choices already.

All in all, not worth the money. Please venture to other establishments in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Just went there once but it was great. Gorgeous location, atmosphere, and everybody's selection was delicious. Great Bloody Mary's too."}
{"text":"My roommates and I just went to Fresco for Madison Restaurant Week. As recent college graduates, our wallets are very slim so we took this opportunity to sample one of the finer dining options in Madison. Overall, we were very pleased with the food. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the service.

For Restaurant Week, we had the choice of three options for three courses. First course, we each picked something different. I had the tomato-red pepper soup, Andee (roommate) had the risotto cake and Jennifer (roommate) had the salad. Andee's cake was good, but I thought it could be warmer. It tasted kind of like a potato pancake. Jenn's salad had fresh vegetables, but I thought it could have had a little more to it. She found a bug in it (we're not sure if it crawled up from the bottom of the salad or if it hopped on the plate) so she sent it back and got the soup instead. The soup was divine. It reminded me of the soup served abroad by our little Italian cook. I'd have it again and again. Simple, but delicious. 

For the main course, we all ordered the tomato braised shirt rib pasta which was very good. I got shafted on the tomatoes which was disappointing because I love tomatoes. But it was still very tasty. Other people ordered the salmon and halibut (not on Restaurant Week menu) which made me want to order it, even though I'm not a huge fan of fish.

For desert, we all originally ordered the key lime creme brulee. However, they were out of it by the end of the night which made me very sad. The replacement of brown butter cake with almonds was very good though. I would have preferred the creme brulee, but the cake didn't disappoint. Andee and Jenn loved it.  

All in all the food was outstanding. The service was slow which was probably due to the kitchen. Very cute for a date, especially if you sit outdoors because the view is pretty awesome. I will definitely go again if I can earn some extra cash."}
{"text":"Beautiful view, beautiful food, and amazing service. I had heard such amazing things about Fresco, and I'm delighted my dinner lived up to my expectations.

I came here last Thursday for my birthday, and we were immediately seated outside (granted, we had a reservation). The view of the capitol is just amazing from the roof. Our server served us our waters and our drinks very quickly. I had the rhubarb cocktail (I can see why people would like it, but I personally didn't enjoy the bitterness) and my boyfriend had the Malbec. Our appetizers were the grilled peach and the grilled tuna. Grilled peach with honey, balsamic, arugula, and goat cheese: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! We were told this plate was one of the most popular dishes, and I completely agree that it deserves its popularity. Tart, savory, sweet goodness with a perfect goat cheese bite. YUM! Grilled tuna: very overshadowed by the peach.

For entrees, I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the scallops. My salmon was crispy and savory, though slightly too salty but very delicious. The potato crisps and beet pairing was my favorite part. My boyfriend enjoyed his scallops but he liked my salmon more.

And for dessert, Fresco allowed me to choose any dessert item for my birthday! Hooray! Beignets with chocolate and creme anglaise: Yes, yes! Note for the future: Definitely have a lactaid beforehand because the dairy filled desserts are worth it. Warm creme with hot beignets were sweet balls of perfection. We also had the chocolate mousse, which was also very delicious. Airy, creamy mousse with a spicy bite! We were pleasantly surprised, though I would order the beignets over the mousse any day.

Amazing service, delicious food, incredible environment. I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was served the Fresco catering last night at the No Reservations: An Evening with Anthony Bourdain event. I'd really like to go and try the restaurant because the items they served were just divine:

+ Cheddar cheese soup shooters
+ Venison lollipops-ish (not actual candy, but venison on a bone)
+ Little brats on a toasted bun
+ Perch with a bread-like coating with tartar sauce on top
+ Pecan pie

Our table kept getting ignored, which is the reason I dropped it to 4. Other than that, the food was consistently good and well enjoyed by my group of friends.

The only other reason I have to drop it to a four is that while this food served was great (in addition to the two complimentary glasses of wine, soda, or beer--I had a white and red, both very good!), the initial food they had laid out was lackluster (except for the cheese spreads and salmon--and I am not a fish-eater.)

I definitely plan on coming here one day when I can; that pecan pie is still haunting my thoughts."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars

Whenever a restaurant group starts to develop an empire of restaurants around a city I tend to worry that they are not going to be up to snuff from a culinary standpoint. such is not the case at Food Fight's flagship restaurant, Fresco. I've dined here a half dozen or more times now and I think it's a very fine restaurant.

Fresco enjoys a very unique location atop the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art adjacent to the world-class Overture Center on State Street. The facility is both indoor and outdoor. The outdoor terrace provides unique views of State Street and the State Capitol as well as a sculpture garden which provides a beautiful space for both public dining as well as private events. the inside space has three glass walls that also provide nice views. White tables (no cloths) and contemporary touches create a modern, vibrant and comfortable atmosphere. If the weather is nice definitely eat outdoors. 

I like to eat family style. In the last visit we had four people and we passed around several dishes from the app menu and then two entrees. On this night there was a crab cake special. These were divine with a hale portion of crab and creamy but citrusy bright sauce. The risotto cakes are a favorite and were also delicious. The Shrimp Diablo gives you three large shrimp with garlic, chili, jicama-carrot red pepper slaw, calamansi lime vinaigrette. A beautiful and delicious dish. The dish that really sent eyes rolling and toes curling on this night was the short rib with smoked butter polenta, seasonal vegetables, beef reduction. This may be the best short rib I've ever had. Rich and delicious. The polenta was perfectly cooked and creamy. So outrageous!

The place always has some great drinks that are many times themed to what is going on in the museum. On this night there were some outstanding margaritas. In the summer I've enjoyed a wonderful spin on a mojito with berries.

Overall I have only one, perhaps odd, suggestion for this place: slow down. The pace was too fast. Dishes were arriving too close to or even on top of each other. I would personally like a tablecloth. There were a few small spills on the Formica topped table and nobody wiped these even before dessert. Also, the Sambuca had either gone bad or that wasn't Sambuca. These are small issues and really here for the restaurant's benefit. 

Service was friendly and attentive if a little over-eager. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic space.  Friendly service.  Wonderful patio.  Our meals were all tasty.  Not a cheap place, but worth the money, to be sure."}
{"text":"Beautiful outlook and atmosphere, a little to much white to the point of sterile,  but the view was more than enough to make up for it.  What can I say,  I'm a sucker for rooftops.  

Food was good,  creative,  and really aesthetic. I had the scallops with lentils and a curry paste, all the flavors were spot on, even if the scallops were,  how shall I say, Midwestern. But that is to be expected around here. 

Grilled Peaches with goat cheese, pecans, honey,  and arugula sounded awesome,  looked great,  and want bad,  but something seemed missing in the mouth.  

Come for the decently fancy food,  come back for the view"}
{"text":"The view and atmosphere are perfectly lovely. The food is usually not quite worth the price. I recommend the New York strip. I do not recommend the diablo shrimp appetizer."}
{"text":"I brought my family to Fresco in an attempt to convince them that local restaurants are a lot more fun, delicious and equally affordable as a Red Lobster or TGIF sort of chain. After a wonderful dinner at here I think they'll trust my judgement a little more next time.

To set the stage they have a very cool, modern vibe. The dining area is all black and red, with low lighting that reminded my sister of a nightclub, but looked like a perfect date night spot to me. The patio also looked incredible, I only wish I had dined here during the summer to get a glance at the state street area at night. 

The cocktails here were fantastic. The waitress mentioned most ingredients were made in house, and you could tell based on the flavor they provided. I had the Few and Far between which was a bourbon drink with super fresh raspberry purée and mint. It kind of reminded me of a mojito, just a little on the fruitier side than the minty one. I got to try my Mom's \"new\" fashioned which was a delicious take on the classic. Local cherries and a very strong orangey flavor made this one delicious as well.

I had a starter of the shrimp diablo which was good but not great. I'm a spicy food lover and typically \"Diablo\" would tip me off that something will be right up my alley, but this app was more garlic than heat. The shrimp were really huge and the slaw beneath was good, carrots and jicama very thinly sliced. My sister started with the Caesar salad which came with an awesomely large crunchy piece of Parmesan on top (and a few anchovies - eek!). All of our entrees though were incredible. I had the lamb that was charred, but fell right off the bone with light couscous and tomatoes. My grandmother had the pork chop with apples, cider and bacon and it was huge! I couldn't believe how generous a portion we got for that price. Her husband got the honey glazed salmon which he enjoyed very much too. My sister had the option to order off their gluten free menu and opted for the cioppino entree which is typically served over pasta, but came for her like a stew in a tomato broth. It had seared scallops, shrimp and mussels in it which I was able to steal bites of and were very tasty.

Everyone else took advantage of their Thursday night special which was gnocchi. Their regular gnocchi comes with a butter cream sauce and vegetables for $17 (which is a portion big enough to fill up my hungry dad and boyfriend), but on Thursdays you can get it for $12 and get three other options for sauces! It's a steal really. My dad got the traditional sauce but added a chicken breast which he said was very good with the skin still on. My aunt got the cheesy broccoli sauce as a vegetarian option and my mother added a short rib to hers which had a sweeter cream sauce and was paired with walnuts and cranberries. Both said their choices were great. My boyfriend got the creamy poblano and spicy sriracha sauce which was also very fantastic. I was very impressed with the variety of dishes that could come off that one base menu item.

I would come here for a special occasion again without question. Great restaurant for dates or family dinners."}
{"text":"Always outstanding. I've eaten here at least 8 times and always had a memorable experience. You really can't order a bad thing on the menu. Service is excellent. 

Great for a date before a show at the oveture."}
{"text":"Pleasantly reminded how good this place is on a recent visit. Extra star for the very creative cocktail menu and the impressive implementation of said menu.

Nice menu choices and everything is well prepared and tasty.

Really the bar here should be packed until late every night. You are missing out people!"}
{"text":"Came up to Fresco sort of on a whim this past Saturday night. They had availability for two so we headed on over (and up).
The location is fantastic, inside the MMoCA and up on the 3rd(ish) floor. Outside, especially in the summer, the view is amazing of the capitol and downtown.
The decor completely fits as though its inside of a modern art museum. Very modern, with bright colors and sharp lines. A little trite, but fits the overall vibe.
The food was delicious-- we had some scallions to start which were devoured instantly. I had the chicken in a pea/leek risotto and pureed cauliflower, which was much more interesting than it could have been. Girlfriend had a wedge salad that she really enjoyed.
Overall, modern american cuisine in a modern museum environment-- the food, while not insanely unique, was definitely good, and goes well with a very cool ambiance and a great view."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Fresco for our anniversary. The location is beautiful and the view of Madison from the rooftop is also quite nice. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and the specials, as well as the wines. Everyone from the host to the servers were friendly and helpful. The food itself was delicious. We had the Vietnamese spring rolls, crisped skin salmon and bucatini pasta. The spring rolls came with 2 sauces (peanut and fish sauce). The peanut was our favorite and really brought out the flavors. The fish was well cooked and delicious. The sauce for the bucatini was just amazing. Needless to say, the 2 of us will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Bingsoo is so good. I totally love this place. My wife and I will drive from Ahwatukee at the drop of a hat to get our fix. My only suggestion would be to call ahead if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewers that the view is the best part of dining at Fresco. The food is equally delicious and very portion conscience as well. The lamb chops here are absolutely delicious, I'd highly recommend them to anyone dining here.
The bar is always fully stocked and the bartenders can make pretty much anything you ask them for, even if its not on the menu, so kudos to them!
Getting to the restaurant can be tedious climbing the glass stairs, so if your afraid of heights, take the elevator."}
{"text":"The View? Great.  Service-attentive.  Proximity to Overture-close.  The apple salad was the only other high point, which was obscured by two overpriced and pedestrian entrees, marring what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner.  The salmon was dry and fishy tasting.  The NY Strip was a very bad joke in terms of quality and uninspired preparation.  The Madison-based Food Fight Co. has a reputation for being proactive about cutting corners after a restaurant opens and is stable (according to numerous former employees I have spoken with).  If this is the case, then the kitchen staff cannot be held responsible for being dealt a \"bad hand\" with regard to the resources with which they are working.   This place would do well to start including organic entree items from local and regional farms.  Many Madison diners will pay a little more for this upgrade.

One last note-the room ambiance borders on deafening if they are at capacity.  If this is the case on your visit, plan to communicate with your dinner companions via texting."}
{"text":"We ended up here around 4pm on Easter afternoon.  We were out walking around the Capitol and State St, and our kids were complaining of being cold.  We were hoping to find a place where my husband and I could get a cocktail and the kids could have a snack, but there were far less businesses open than I expected.  We noticed Fresco was open, so we made the trek up the beautiful, light-filled staircase.  Their Easter brunch had already ended, and we were the only ones there.  I felt a little awkward walking into such a pristine, fine dinning restaurant with my energetic kids and our casual attire, but the staff was SO welcoming.  Our server brought warm bread and asked the chef if he could make a kid friendly snack.  We didn't even ask him for this, he just did it.  He was so nice and accommodating.  

My husband ordered the Fall Mule, which was from their specialty cocktail menu, and I ordered a Brandy Old Fashioned Sweet.  Both were exceptional.  The Old Fashioned was the best I've ever had.  They really put extra care and attention into the details.  Even the garnish cherries were specially soaked in spices and gave the drink an unique and TASTY flare.  I ordered another round, and the server gave us a small bowl of the spiced cherries for my kids.  So thoughtful!

I can't review the food from the menu since we just had snacks, but I can only imagine it's amazing if they put this much attention into the bread, drinks and snacks!  I can't wait to come back and explore the entrees and soak up some sun on their amazing rooftop patio."}
{"text":"This was one of the best restaurants that I tried in Madison. I ended up getting:

gin & ginger smash ($8) st george dry rye gin, goose island spicy ginger soda, ginger simple syrup, mint, lemon

bbq pulled pork tostadas ($9) roasted poblano crema, jalapeño honey-grilled pineapple, cilantro pickled onion slaw 

watermelon cucumber salad ($8) mixed greens, mint, chevre cheese, watermelon vinaigrette

chicken fresco ($20) nueske's ham, polenta, broccoli, green bean, tomato, hook's swiss cheese cream

and mixed berry cheesecake to go ($6) lemon curd

The pulled pork tostadas and watermelon cucumber salad could have been a meal in itself. Three tostadas came with the appetizer and it was a little difficult to eat with a fork and a knife. the jalapeno honey-grilled pineapple was not overwhelming and added great flavor to the dish. I finished my gin & ginger smash beverage went well with both tostadas and salad.

Then I got the chicken fresco - I was already full when the meal came so I ate all of the vegetables and a piece of the chicken. The chicken was very tender and the skin was crispy. Even when ate the leftovers in my room it was still delicious. 

The mixed berry cheesecake was not that great..but it didn't warrant for any stars to come off. I'm sure if it was just a simple New York cheesecake with some chocolate sauce I would have liked it better. The crust was yummy."}
{"text":"Flush your money down the toilet it is much more satisfying then eating at Fresco. We were there for a UW Commencement dinner, and three of us in the party contemplated leaving. We climbed to the roof and it was packed! To get to the rooftop you walk through the restaurant which means squeezing past poor patrons trying to enjoy their meal. Not a lot of room to move around. We were seated and right away I knew this was going to be all bad. Our waiter Johnny was so annoying that literally it was like nails on a chalkboard every time he said anything. Unfortunately for us he was a major talker and it seemed like he was working too hard for a big tip. Just thinking about him now makes me cringe. I don't care about what you like or what you did this past year when you graduated college, stop trying so hard!!

Now the food. SNL needs to make a comedy script out of this place. The menu was fixed- $35/person for a salad and an entree. Please be forewarned that squirrels eat bigger portions than what you will be offered at Fresco. We all ordered the Caesar salad and it came without dressing! On purpose! How can it be called a Caesar salad without dressing? Try calling it dried iceberg lettuce with flakes of cheese. We all asked for dressing because the idea of eating dried lettuce is just all wrong. We waited and waited and waited some more for them to bring out the teeny tiny cups of dressing. This place is hilarious. I think they are having some kind of identity crisis and it feels all of Madison is having. Newsflash, you are a restaurant in a town in the Midwest, you are not in New York City. Get over yourselves Fresco. 

The main course gets even better. My step-kids' grandfather orders the flank steak medium and it came out so rare I was worried it was going to hop off his plate and smack me in the face. He sent it back to actually have some heat put on it. I had the gnocchi which was meh at best. Full disclosure, other members in our party had the salmon and they raved about it so maybe there is one bright star at Fresco. The chicken was dry and overcooked.

Then the super annoying waiter decided it would be a good time to ask if we were interested in dessert and proceeded to show us the menu that consisted of three items. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake and the blueberry crumble. The chocolate cake was mini and the blueberry crumble honestly looked so gross and mushy I couldn't even try a taste of and I am a fruit crumble fanatic!

$500 later we left feeling underwhelmed and robbed. The whole meal was probably worth $150 max. Save yourself the time, the money, and the hassle and go to some of the other restaurants that Madison has to offer. The rooftop views look directly at other buildings so even the view is a sad disappointment!"}
{"text":"I can never choose a favorite restaurant in Madison but after dining at Fresco for the second time I'm almost sure this is it. The atmosphere and the food create an exceptional experience that I'm not sure anywhere else in town can match. Last night we had one of those meals that was so perfect in every way that I'm still beaming. 

Ambiance:
Fresco makes you feel like you're in South Beach but instead of the people you'd find in South Beach you have nice Madisonians. On top of the Contemporary Art Museum, you have to walk up a beautiful spiral staircase surrounded by giant windows up the atrium to get to the restaurant. The inside is very modern and hip looking, but not sterile. Because the walls are windows, everything is light and you get a beautiful view. Therefore, you can dine here in the winter and still sort of feel like you're eating outside. 

However, if the weather is nice and there's a table available, you should absolutely sit on the rooftop patio. The patio has a garden and some interesting statues. As I mentioned earlier, it feels like a more laid back version of a lounge at a boutique hotel in Miami. It's unique and beautiful. The highlight is the view of state street's signs, nearby churches and the Capitol building (lit up at night!). If you have guests in town, this is the perfect place to take them to show them how pretty our city can be. This would also be a wonderful venue to host a party. I cannot speak more highly of it.

They hold events here in the summer that are really fun. Last summer we went to a Riesling tasting here and even if we weren't sampling a ton of awesome wine, the combination of the open, window surrounded interior and the fun patio would've been enough for a fabulous evening. Definitely recommend checking their event calendar. 

Food:
I haven't tried anything I didn't like here. The menu is creative but not trying quite so hard like some of Madison's other upscale, foodie spots. It's possible to order an appetizer and an entree or enjoy a tapas style meal by sharing the awesome small plates with your group. I love that they have so many salads and vegetable dishes on the menu that are actually inventive and appealing. No need to feel like you're making a sacrifice by being \"good\". They use a lot of fresh ingredients and portion sizes are such that you walk out satisfied without being in a food coma. 

The menu changes seasonally, and when I returned for the second time I was really disappointed that the risotto cakes were no longer on the menu because they ROCKED. At the end of the day this just meant I got to try a whole new set of amazing dishes. Highlights included the grilled peach, scallops, salmon and lobster Cobb salad. They briefly grill the romaine in the salad and subsequently chill it. I've never been so excited about eating lettuce; it was delicious. We shared the chocolate filled beignets for dessert which were fabulous.

I can't review Fresco without mentioning the awesome cocktails. The Rhubarb was one of the best cocktails I've tried in Madison. The flavors complimented each other in a very sophisticated way, the tartness of the rhubarb with the spice of the pepper infused vodka. This impressed both my mother who enjoys girly, tropical drinks and my father who usually dislikes sweet cocktails. He actually wanted his own! But he stuck with a Hungarian wine which he tried and loved off the unique wine list. 

Wrap up:
The service was just as excellent as the food and the atmosphere. Our server was really helpful and attentive. The best part was when my dad was talking about how he saw all of these gorgeous radishes at farmer's market and how he'd love to just munch on one before we ordered food, and a few minutes later our waitress returned with a sliced radish in a dish as a snack. He loved it! 

The prices are super reasonable. I think it's one of the more affordable \"nice\" restaurants in Madison. Fresco is a perfect date spot, girls night spot, birthday dinner spot...really anything. I love it."}
{"text":"Fresco is definitely on my rotation of restaurants to frequent when i don't feel like cooking and if i'm hanging out downtown. The ambiance is casual and relaxing, and the food is solid. My recent favorites are the scallops and the pork medallions. The chefs are good at changing up the menu and keeping things interesting, however sometimes their combinations don't work. I generally stay away from ethnic inspired dishes. Also the menu is not very kids friendly so take that into consideration if you have small children. Luckily my three year old is just as adventurous (or should I say gullible) as her mama so I'm not too concerned about that."}
{"text":"COST:
$8 (Cocktail)

I already forgot exactly what we had lol (there's a photo attached) but it had whiskey and ginger beer in it, and it was delicious! The drink was on the stiff side as well so I got what I paid for. 

Their dinners looked delicious as well but unfortunately I didn't get to try them. The bar/restaurant is located at the top of the museum and you have access to their outdoor rooftop while you're at it. I recommend going outside after some drinks to take on some beautiful views."}
{"text":"The bartender makes a great martini. I had the short ribs - not what I expected (I should have read the description better - but I couldn't stop eating it. YUM! The appetizers were fine. I would go right to the entree an save room for dessert."}
{"text":"I think about Fresco the way others may think about Disneyworld: it's the most magical place on earth but it can be expensive planning a trip there (at least it is for a college student). The price honestly doesn't matter much because it. is. so. worth. it. This is the ONLY place my friends and I are willing to splurge our money on (again, broke college students). 

The view is beautiful, the drinks are tasty, the waitstaff are great, and the food is amazing. My favorites are the wild mushroom risotto cake (although the pea risotto cake they have in the winter time is also delicious) and the halibut. The cioppino pasta is okay... it sounds amazing with all of the different kinds of seafood, but it felt more like a messy mixture of things that would probably taste better individually. Their beignets are also really great. I'm actually sad because my first time trying beignets was at Fresco, and it was so good that I became disappointed when I tried beignets anywhere else. :(

The next time I'm in Wisconsin, I am most certainly making a trip to Fresco.

Side note: I wonder if they sometimes take nibblets of our food when we ask to get it packed. There was a time I went to Fresco after recovering from pneumonia and literally only took two bites of my entree because I still hadn't gained back my appetite. I got my food boxed and noticed the day after that half of the seafood in my pasta was gone."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review of this place? 

A favorite of my husbands and mine, it was our first \"formal date\" and we take all our out of town guests. 

The menu changes quarterly I'd say but that always have the classics. (A few fish options, steak, chicken, pork, veggie) 

The first time I had the Salmon Risotto. Hands down the best meal of my life. My husband had the Seared Tuna salad, also very good. 

Since we've had the Chicken Fresco, Pork Schnitzel, Gnocchi, Steak, Scallops, Fresh Pasta, Crispy Skin Salmon. Many appetizers and amazing desserts. (Chocolate Lava Cake always wins) You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

Make sure you check out the Brunch on Sunday's. They take reservations which is rare for brunch. $25, you get donuts with their monthly dipping sauce, a main course, and two beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic options) Try the Green Bloody Mary if it's still an option ;) 

P.S. Never pass on the bread. Don't even share it if you can help it."}
{"text":"Rooftops will forever have a special place in my heart and that's the experience you pay for here. Not many great roof top venues in the flat Mid-west. But this one's a good venue for an experience factor. Their gnocchi is the best, but their other entrees are not a disappointment either. Lots of wine choices."}
{"text":"I came here for my last supper with my SEASSI Family. Ever since I saw this place on State Street I knew I wanted to come here. Any restaurant attached to an art gallery is sure to be good. And it was. The interior of this place is to die for, complete with a rooftop patio.

The manager here was also very accommodating for a group of 12 people who needed last minute reservations! So thankful because this really is the only place that I wanted to try. 

I got some sparkling water for my drink. It's actually VOSS, which I thought was very trendy. I went with the Salmon for my dinner. It was great. Food came out at a decent time and we weren't stuck waiting around too long. Server was attentive to our table. 

Hopefully the next time I get back to Wisconsin I will have the opportunity to try more food here! I would absolutely love to go here again, it's definitely my style to say the least!"}
{"text":"This place is why I have a rule about not ordering seafood when I can't see an ocean. Chef needs to take the bloodline out of the bass!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and cocktails on the roof in downtown Madison. Food was good, they provided a complimentary dessert for Olga celebrating her birthday."}
{"text":"Menu changes seasonally.  Fall-off-the-bone tender lamb.  Served medium.  Delicious.  Great views from the balcony of the 3rd floor.  Nice wine list.  Great service."}
{"text":"My friends from Madison took me here on a beautiful June night for the views. We had already had dinner, so we were just there to enjoy cocktails and dessert. 

Service was great. Our waitress was attentive without being overbearing and was very friendly and sweet. We each started off with summer cocktails- between us we had the strawberry basil mojito, the blueberry lemonade (I think that's what it was- it was very very sweet), and some concoction made with clementines and summer in a glass. All were pretty good. 

We also had some desserts- the deconstructed snickers bar tart and the buttermilk beignets. Both were delicious. 

The menu looked interesting but friends told me it's better for just apps or just dessert. I'd definitely go back though."}
{"text":"I was thinking I was going to give this place 4 stars, but I can't. I've been there twice and while it's not the first place you consider for a fine dining experience, it was exceptional both times. I've had the duck and the dry-aged strip steak and both were excellent, my wife also really likes their fish. It also has a great atmosphere with great views of State Street and the Capitol. Like I said, I went in anticipating giving this place a 4, but can't think of a good reason not to give it a 5...I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We ordered many of the small plate items and they were ALL tasty. The sugar snap pea cheffanade was so delicious. The lobster risotto with chive oil was totally satisfying. We cleaned our plates! 
The gnocchi was wonderful. All the flavored were spot on! 
I would five stars except I felt the patio seating could have been cleaner. More charming. It's such a great space, it just needs a little TLC. But I would go back for the food any day!"}
{"text":"Suffering from a bout of cabin fever due to lingering effect of the polar vortex, the WaunaQueen and I decided to pay Fresco a visit for a date night excursion.  We also had a $50 Food Fight gift card burning a hole in our pocket as added incentive to brave the elements and journey from our Waunakee lair.

Even when outdoor seating is not an option, Fresco delivers plenty of romantic ambiance as a date night venue.  With three sides of the restaurant encased by glass walls, Fresco provides its patrons with unique, panoramic views of downtown and the Capitol.  Throw in romantic lighting, a simple yet elegant black and white interior and a bar that emanates a ruby-red glow and you have one the best romantic dining sites in Madison.  The only drawback is that Fresco densely packs its tables together so at times it feels you are on a blind double date with the adjoining table. 

I appreciate Fresco's unpretentious drink menu.  The wine options are affordable (due to extensive use of New World reds) and pair well with the entrée options on the dinner menu.  I am also a fan of their array of cocktail options.  I usually do not order an Old Fashioned when out on the town, but the house-made maraschino door county tart cherries caught my eye.  I loved the drink, especially the citrus note from the bittercube orange bitter.  Finally, kudos for our ever-so-helpful server who deftly helped us navigate the wine list based on our entrees and our wine preferences.

As for the food, there is much to like.  However, the spotty execution of the dishes means Fresco falls a notch below the upper echelon of Madison restaurants.  I do appreciate the heavy reliance on locally grown produce and the seasonal nature of the menu.  The roasted vegetables in both entrees were deeply caramelized on the exterior adding texture and allowing to natural sweetness of the winter vegetable to sing.  And two thumbs up for the preparation of sauces; both the brown butter herb sauce on the gnocchi and the truffle crème fraiche on the short ribs elevated their respective dishes.  

Overall, our food lacked the shock and awe that befits such a chic setting.  The creamy potato soup was under-seasoned and felt watered down.  At $6 for a tiny serving, it was not a good value.  The gnocchi was chewy and cut extremely large.  My first order of short ribs came out cold.  After mentioning this to our server, she apologized and took the plate away with no further explanation.  This created a dining dilemma since we did not know how long it would take my entrée to return.  Should my wife hold off eating her entrée and risk it getting cold or does she start eating her meal and risk finishing her dish before mine returns.  Next time I will know to ask how long it will take to replace my dish, but the server should have handled that problem more proactively.  To the kitchen's credit, after ten minutes, I received a fork-tender plate of unctuous braised beef.  The serving sizes are extremely generous and made for wonderful dining the following day.

Due to the drawn out nature of our meal, we had room for dessert and ordered the superbly plated buttermilk beignets.  These pillowy morsels ended our meal on a high note as the milk chocolate filling paired flawlessly with the silky crème anglaise sauce.

Even factoring in the misfires by the kitchen, the strength of the venue and the bar warrants a four star rating."}
{"text":"Loved it! I came during restaurant week - I know, this review is SUPER late - and the menu was fantastic! All for a very reasonable price, as well. The three course meal was a really great way to try out desserts/appetizers that I'm usually too cheap to order myself (unless the meal is on someone else...JUST KIDDING!). 

The service is great. Very attentive, but not to the point of smothering. The waitress was also able to provide recommendations for each of the choices on the menu, which my friend and I both found very helpful.  

The restaurant is situated on the 3rd floor of MMOCA right next to the sculpture garden, making for a great view during dinner while the sun is setting. I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I had a really good time here. The food was absolutely delicious. One of the best meals I've had in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Great views of the Capitol! Our waiter was very nice and knowledgable, and the food was amazing. There aren't very many options, so three of us at the table ended up getting the pesto gnocchi... None of us were disappointed. It was the best gnocchi I've ever had, and one of the best pasta + pesto combinations I've had. The service was a little slow and the restaurant wasn't that crowded, but they'll give you plenty of bread to distract your hunger!"}
{"text":"That is some tasty bingsoo.  Mango sauce.  Yogurt.  Boba.  Now I just need me some green tea to top it off and I'll be good to go.

The two IKEA springy cushion chairs on the wood deck in the front door are pretty sweet if you are lucky enough to score them.  The rule is that when people walk by the store, you need to freeze and pretend like you're a store display."}
{"text":"We tried Fresco for the first time tonight, selecting their Food Week menu.  All the items were drawn from their dinner menu, with the cheaper of the entree items.  First of all, we had no idea how to get into the place, and wandered with another couple lost in the Overture hallway until finding a buzzer to request entry from the back.  For future reference, it is easily accessed from the front entrance of the Museum of Contemporary Art.  

It was a snowy day, so we took advantage of a portable coat rack they kept at the front desk - a nice convenience, but did make it feel a bit crowded and awkward to enter the restaurant.  It was quite busy, and I would strongly recommend getting reservations well in advance.

Service was good - attentive without hovering.  In addition to our server, two different managers stopped by to check on our experience.  Seating is definitely cozy - don't leave the most private discussions for this restaurant.  We didn't feel rushed at all on courses, and food was served at a good pace.  We took a total of 45 minutes from seating to out the door.

Food was very nice, served in a minimalist style without too much fuss.  We both started with the tomato and red pepper soup.  The soup had a very fresh red pepper taste, with the tomato flavor coming on more strong later in the bite.  But the best part of the soup was the crostini topper with fresh mozzarella, basil, and roasted cherry tomatoes - I could have eaten a whole meal of just these crusty, cheesy delights.  I chose the butternut squash.  It was a generous, but not overwhelming portion and cooked to perfection.  I personally found the sage oil a bit overwhelming, but loved the toasted walnuts on top - they made the dish.  My husband had a mushroom and sausage pasta dish, which he enjoyed - commenting it was very \"earthy\".  Dessert was nice and light.  I chose the beignet plate - three golfball sized fried dough fritters with a small shot of milk chocolate inside (just a dime-sized amount).  They were good, but never having had a beignet before, I have no idea if they were authentic.  My husband went with the fresh sherbets, saying the raspberry was good, while the lime was exceptionally refreshing.

My only real negative on the experience was the menu was nearly impossible to read - light ink in a frilly font behind a plastic cover and in a darkly lit room.  Bring your glasses!  That, and the close seating arrangements that really made for awkward silences as we could not help but hear conversations at neighboring tables."}
{"text":"Light!  Refreshing!    We tried Fresco (and bingsoo) for the first time Saturday night.  Did I mention it was light and refreshing?

These folks take pride in the product they sell.  Light, refreshing (did I mention that yet) frozen yogurt and carefully sliced fresh fruit on top of finely shaved ice with a drizzle of mango glaze.  Light and refreshing and so much healthier than DQ.  

We'll be back for more and to try the boba."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and was overall happy with the experience. I wish there was an option for fractions of a star so I could rate it 3.5 or 3.75 because there was definitely room for improvement. I know they use local and fresh ingredients but a lot of the menu was not available and even the majority of the beers on tap were out. I did however love my snap pea salad with prosciutto.  For dinner I had the chicken and my boyfriend the pork. The chicken and vegetables were really delicious but every once in a while I'd get a super salty bite that was slightly off putting. The pork was good as well but nothing I'd rave about. The service was decent but I did notice our water glasses did not get refilled throughout our entire meal. Would come but to explore more of the menu but hopefully get better service next time."}
{"text":"We met our daughter here for dinner. I can't say enough how great this place was!

We shared a flatbread with cheese and mushrooms. I had the salmon which was perfectly cooked. It came with potatoes cooked in a to die for tarragon sauce. Hubby had a pork dish. He ate it so fast, that I couldn't get a picture! He loved it. Daughter had a wonderful veggie option; gnocchi. 

We shared mini donuts with sauce for dessert. 

The service was great....

We will be back again in the summer. I can't wait to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Visited three times...Wonderful food, tastefully done without excessive portions or overly fat-ladden sauces. They are excellent with fish. Incredibly fresh salads and cheese selections...food was excellent each time. Emphasis on locally grown everything. Excellent ambience, generally. Can be a bit overcrowded at times which can put a strain on staff, but food is totally worth the trip. Definitely a special occasion adventure on my budget, but well worth it."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight with a large group so perhaps the food may have been different had we not. Overall, it was a good experience and one I'd repeat despite the mediocrity affecting some of the dishes ordered. We started with the tuna tartare and it was beautiful but lacked a bit of salt. My husband settled on the gnocchi. The sauce had good flavor but the gnocchi itself were mushy unlike the old preparation that had an even, golden sear that added a huge flavor component that is now all too lacking. I ordered the lamb and found it to be perfectly cooked, beautiful in its presentation and well seasoned. We ordered 2 specialty cocktails as well, my husband got the bourbon peach and I got the tequila, pineapple, poblano. I very much enjoyed mine, it reminded me of a margarita variation served up. 
We had friends that ordered the brussel sprouts (they loved them), the spring rolls with cooked salmon (they would not reorder due to the fact that the salmon was cooked and threw off the flavors) and the burger (the fries were outstanding). Lastly, we visited the bar (it's quite small) and learned they have 3 house infused spirits, all of them sounded interesting and worth trying. The staff was patient and friendly with our huge group and never made us feel like we were a burden."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have dined here on visits to Madison.  This time it was a bitter cold night so outdoor dining was not an option like the previous visit.  We had a big group of 14 celebrating my in-laws anniversary.  Given the weather and holiday it was pretty quiet here.

Our waiter did a good job of herding the group including two young children.  We sampled some of their specialty drinks and all were tasty. The butter leaf wedge salad was nice - loved the candied nuts on it - as were some of the apps we ordered like the Brussels sprouts. For an entree a number of us ordered the salmon and it was excellent (perfectly prepared) as were the reports on the scallops. 

They also prepared a dessert sampler platter so everyone could get a taste.  Overall a very pleasant experience and a nice way for the family to celebrate together."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Fresco! This is my favorite restaurant in Madison. 

I've been there twice, once for a my anniversary and more recently for a work anniversary. 

I had their braised short rib dish which had an amazing sauce with a hint of truffle oil. There were also snap peas, pea greens, and mushrooms, and this amazing handmade pasta. The whole dish was absolute perfection.

You can tell that the chefs put a lot of thought into each dish on the menu."}
{"text":"I believe people go here for the view, not the food. That should say enough about Fresco. 

If you must go here are some tips:

1. Outdoor seating is a must and try to get a chair at the table that is facing the capitol. 
2. Try to go before all the college kids are back on campus-otherwise friday/saturday night partying = lots of sirens. ;)
3. If you're hungry get the seafood pasta dish, the lamb chops that the fiance got were a small portion that he ended up eating off my plate too!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant for an upscale dinner or a casual evening with friends. I was in town for work and met up with a friend and he high my recommended this place. The wait staff was amazing, not to mention the view skyline view of the city. The restaurant is located atop a museum. We enjoyed the halibut, broccoli, Brussels sprouts (to die for), 2 glasses of wine and the gnocchi. Would def visit again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Fresco last weekend with high hopes. The food wasn't great, but that was the least of our troubles. The experience was terrible. 

My boyfriend ordered the bayoubaisse and thought it was ok. I, on the other hand, ordered the gnocchi, which came out stone cold. Anyone who knows much about food/cooking will understand that being cold is an especially huge problem for potato-based foods (just imagine how mashed potatoes get rock hard when refrigerated). They were literally inedible.

At first, I thought it want going to be a big deal: our waiter would be return in a few minutes to ask how it was, I would explain the issue, and he would fix it. Not so. An hour went by before I saw my waiter again, at which point he didn't even question me as to why I had eaten only one bite of my entree. My first glimpse of him was when my uneaten food whisked away without asking (even though he was not yet clearing my boyfriends food). He then paused for a moment, my food already in his hands, and asked \"can I wrap this up for you?\" 

At no point did anyone working in this restaurant stop to ask if I had left all my food uneaten for a reason.

After running off with my food, we never saw our waiter again. We finally got our check when one of the hostesses noticed us scrambling for the attention of a server, asked what she could do to help, and then brought us the check herself. It is worth noting that, despite being in her first week at Fresco, this new hostess was by far the most helpful and accommodating person we met all night. She was truly lovely.

In conclusion, I worked as a waitress for 4 years and am pretty understanding of mistakes, but this was just atrocious. There is no excuse for this kind of quality and service, particularly coming from a higher end restaurant."}
{"text":"After flaming the hell out of the Overture Center, I guess I *SHOULD* find something good about it.

And Fresco is definitely that.  Not because it's particularly a good restaurant (it isn't actually) but because the decor and the drinks AND THE VIEW (especially at dusk) is just breathtaking.

It's good for drinks before the show.  

That's it."}
{"text":"I never knew Madison had any rooftop restaurants. I really loved the vibe of this place. The food was really good, service was beyond excellent (I wish I could remember the name of our waiter), and then there's the beautiful view from the rooftop. It reminds me a little of some of the places I frequent in New York where I live. Next time I'm back in Madison I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I have really loved going to Fresco at dinner for quite some time, but we recently went for brunch and it was one of the worst brunches I've had in Madison. I'm keeping it at a 2 instead of a 1 because their brunch is quite the deal price-wise. 

For brunch, they have an entirely fixed menu, which means everyone pays $25 and you get a small donut, 2 drinks, and an entree. The value is great, as long as you get the boozy drinks. Their brunch menu should really offer more flexibility for those who don't drink or only want the entrees. 

I was hoping the \"donut appetizer\" would be a bit more generous than it actually was. They were carefully counted at 1 per person, as evidenced by one person in our party who arrived late and was served a single small donut hole. 

I tried the margarita for my first drink and the prosecco for my second drink. Both were fine. Another person at our table ordered the sparkling rose and it came out flat. 

I got the quiche as my entree and that was the most disappointing. The egg part of the quiche was chewy and inedible; I ended up not finishing it. The salad that came on the side was fine, but had barely any dressing on it.

The place was dead and we went on a Sunday at 11am (prime brunch time). Perhaps the rest of this town has already figured out it isn't the best brunch spot."}
{"text":"Was here twice very recently. Food was very good, highly recommend the pulled pork sliders and the new york strip. The service was very sweet and the environment is just awesome. Made my reservation through opentable and the process was just easy and smooth. The dessert could use some improvement but 5 stars is my recognition of this place as a solid choice for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food! From out of town and found this place on yelp.  Great find.  The mussels were fantastic as was the pork loin and dry new york strip.  Great views and nice staff.  Best meal I have had in months.  Will visit again when back in town for sure."}
{"text":"Fresco is a fun spot to rub shoulders with your fellow Madison sophisticates. I enjoy stopping in here for a scotch or martini before doing some less structured and well behaved drinking later on. It's also a good spot at which to stop after a show at the Overture Center.

They make sizable martinis, and they are only slightly overpriced, undoubtedly to help price out the \"riff raff.\" The only drawbacks are that their hours are a bit unpredictable - sometimes they are open late, but other times they are closed by the time I go out.

All in all, Fresco is one of the many spots that make up a well rounded evening in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"I've been to Fresco twice now and have been absolutely enamored both visits. This last weekend my boyfriend and I went to a late dinner at Fresco for Madison Restaurant Week. The restaurant is located at the top of the Overture Museum and has a really nice and relaxing vibe. The space is quite small but that definitely makes it cozier. 

For the appetizer I had roasted brussel sprouts with a gouda fondue and pistachios.  The brussels were served as a salad and the gouda fondue was perfectly flavored, a little smoky, and really added a richness to the simple vegetable. 

For the main course I had the salmon with a lemon dill sauce served over a mix of roasted root vegetables. The salmon was cooked absolutely perfectly and the vegetables added a nice texture to the dish.  The lemon dill sauce may have been one of my favorite parts of this meal due to it's amazing flavor and ability to bring the whole dish together.  

For the dessert (I was quite full at this point!), I had the earl grey creme brulee. As a lactose intolerant I could only eat about 1/4 of this dish unfortunately because it was so rich and creamy.  The earl grey flavor really shined through. 

Overall, I will always come back to Fresco. It's the perfect restaurant for a date night or girl's night out."}
{"text":"Yikes, that was disappointing....New Years Eve dinner at Fresco left a lot to be desired.  My husband had the chicken and it was like rubber.  Looked like something they ordered for hot lunch at school.  I had the lobster which was supplemented with potato.  The prawns were mushy.  The server thought they messed up the order.  They ran out of Creme brulee.  Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"I came here for Summer Restaurant Week on Monday. I had an awesome time. The rooftop area is great. It's fun to be able to see the Capitol and State Street while eating.

For my appetizer, I picked a baby kale salad with hazelnuts. Needless to say, I'd like to add hazelnuts to all my salads now. The vinaigrette was pretty light and had just enough acidity to it.

I got the Mushroom Ricotta Gnocchi as my entree. It was heavenly. The sauce wasn't too heavy, so it worked out great. There were enoki mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms in it, and the mushrooms were super fresh.

For dessert, I got the Honey Lavender Crème Brûlée with raw almonds on top. I cannot say enough good things about this. I'm usually so wary of getting things with lavender, only because I associate it with soap and candles and such, but the flavor wasn't overwhelming at all, and it was just so good.

I regret not getting the frosé (yes, frozen rosé!!)... So I think I am going to have to come back for that."}
{"text":"Fresco is an awesome place to go for a great meal once a year.  It has a super classy environment and a beautiful view of downtown Madison.  The food is exceptional and everything about the place was elegant and pleasant.  Make sure to try the appetizers, they're delicious."}
{"text":"The chicken fresco was awesome, but the food was overpriced. A wonderful atmosphere for the family and easily accessible.  The staff was completely helpful in helping to pick out gluten free food.  They have a separate section of drinks to accommodate gluten free individuals.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great view of the downtown area and equally creative cocktails. Food portions are small, but this is the perfect place to kick it with your girlfriends."}
{"text":"Perched in the rooftop sculpture garden of Madison's new arts center, the Overture, Fresco has one of the best views in town.  Warmed by two glasses of red and three good friends, my experience there was pleasant (ifnot also slightly blurred by the syrah). Some fantastic scallops were followed by a fine beef tenderloin.  The sides (potatoes and a seasonal veggie) were a bit bland but nothing offensive.

However, like so many FoodFight locations, Fresco is big on style and not much else. The price tags here don't equal the quality.  Head there to impress a date or out-of-towner with the view but don't expect too much from the meal."}
{"text":"It is my second time to visit Fresco. We stopped by during Restaurant week. It is very nice that the restaurant offers both restaurant week menu and moral menu. It is not bad to try both options.

The server is really nice and checked us for several times. The restaurant has very beautiful view. You could see the capital through the window. Fresco offers wine pairing for each dish and there exist small/large glass options.

From my view, one special property of Fresco is the beautiful and delicate Food layout. However, this time the food itself kind of disappoints me comparing to the previous visiting. The grilled chicken is a little dry and not juicy. The crisp salmon is better but also just an average level. The appetizers tomato soup and wedge salads are better than the main entrees. The flourless chocolate cake is my favorite that night, not very sweet and milky/silky taste(not sure it is the right description).

The plate layout is not as beautiful and delicate as before. Maybe the overall level of the restaurant decreases or different season has different layout style(my previous visit is during summer) or what I tried is restaurant menu instead of normal. I still give it 4 stars though all disadvantages I mentions before, I really love the feeling and style of this restaurant and I enjoyed dinner here with my lover and friends. If you never visit here before, you deserve to try one time!"}
{"text":"I came here with a corporate party. I would otherwise not have come here because the food is too expensive for what you get. It is unfortunate because I think the ingredients are good, but the preparation is not. I would not come here again. If I had this kind of money to spend on a restaurant I would rather go to Tornado Room."}
{"text":"Bing-effing-Soo. My new favorite thing in life. If you're like me, you've probably never heard of \"Bingsoo\" before. It's one of those things that makes me feel like I'm not as culturally aware as I think I am. Bingsoo is a Korean dessert which works like this: 

-You take a bowl and fill the bottom portion with shaved ice. 
-You take some frozen yogurt and plop it on top of the shaved ice. 
-Sprinkle in a healthy serving of fresh fruit into the mix. (your choice of what) 
-Finally add a fruit puree to top it off. 

...now if you're a finicky eater like me, then your first instinct might be to try and eat the Bingsoo as it is served in different layers...don't do it...this is one instance where you wanna bring back your inner first grader, and just mix it all up into a mush. Trust me...it's absolutely delicious that way. If you're a bit crazy...add some boba balls into the mix, to top it all off...why not. If you mix it all up, you'll be left with a blissful bowl of icy/fruity goodness. I can't believe it took me 27 years of walking this earth to discover that shaved ice mixed with yogurt and fruit could be such a heavenly (and healthy) treat. 

They also serve boba tea and all sorts of other random smoothies, drinks and desserts...but you come here for the Bingsoo. I really hope Bingsoo catches on, because if the mainstream public could taste this stuff they'd be hooked...most people in America just haven't heard of it I'm assuming, so they don't know what they're missing. I'm not aware of any other place in the valley that serves this up besides Fresco...I could be wrong though. 

You heard it here... 

Add Bingsoo to your 'toodoo' list. 

4/5"}
{"text":"I have had dinner here more times than I can remember and I have yet to find something on their menu I didn't like or a bad server. The food is excellent and is always cooked to perfection. If you're a drinker the alcohol selection is pretty good. But the thing that sets fresco apart from every other restaurant in Madison is the atmosphere. It is on top of an art museum to start with. The lights are dim except the red glow from the bar and inside walls. Every table comes with candles and flowers and to make things even better.... The outside wall is all glass. You can enjoy the inside and stare out into the beautiful downtown area with the capital building in the background. O ya did I mention there is outdoor seating too? Go to fresco and I promise no matter what the meal is you will love it. Don't forget your date!"}

the yogurt makes the shaved ice deliciously creamy and the shaved ice keeps the yogurt frozen longer so you can enjoy it more. the fruits look, smell, and taste great, but they kinda get frozen in the mix. also, the place was deserted when we went, which gave it a somewhat depressing feel."}
