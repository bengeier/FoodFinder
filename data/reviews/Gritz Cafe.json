{"text":"I put my previous review n the wrong area, so this will be pretty short...great food at great prices! Make sure you order ahead if you have no patience, food takes a while to come out but oh so worth it when you get it. Clean environment, friendly staff. Place is super small"}
{"text":"Gritz is the best for classic soul food and great service. I went with the BLT the last time and loved it. Thank you to the owners and workers for making such fine food and building a great culture!"}
{"text":"Very good!  The Gritz were amazing chicken and waffles on point! I need this in Texas lol"}
{"text":"this restaurant was very good. the service was good. the place is knida small so get there early"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Friendly staff and the food was ridiculously good! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Perfect! Not on a main road location is kinda hidden. Service was great and fast! Food was delicious couldn't even finish all of it. Only minus is women's bathroom was out of order and its small inside. Also you order off a paper menu thats not available unless your looking for it. For ppl that have never been there before it would b better to have the menus out in plain site."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! We had the fried catfish and chicken; gritz and potatoes. Everything was GREAT"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing southern food - the catfish, grits & greens were delicious. We were on our way out of Vegas looking for a place for breakfast and found this place online. It's the kind of gem you find from time to time, small, friendly, no frills, hugely popular with the locals, and incredibly tasty food."}
{"text":"I love this place! The grits taste like my mommas and usually need nothing added to them. The chicken and catfish is also amazing! Staff is friendly as well. SN: On my last visit I was dissapointed. The grits were watery and flavorless. I'm not sure if they had someone different making them but I'm hoping this will not be a regular occurrence. I've been here several times and was never disappointed before so I'm going to try not to let this one bad experience turn me off."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their food. But had to take away a star for the long wait for some chicken wings. and another star taken for how expensive the price is."}
{"text":"Really small place its best to know what you want walking in the door and come with at least two people so one can get a table. Food is ok mad fresh"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer at Grits Cafe.  The food is awesome, with one exception; the grits.  I'm a Chef, with breakfast food being at the top of my favorite things to prepare.  Growing up my mother made grits that were thick and creamy, in a sense like cream of wheat.  Well at Grits Cafe, the grits always have a thin film of water on top, and lack the creamy-ness I grew so fond of as a child.  So I usually order the home fries with catfish, and eggs.  Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.  If you go, I  promise you will like..."}
{"text":"Great place to end after going to Gilcrest Orchard. The best chicken wings and waffles. Its worth a drive. It is a small restaurant and the workers are super friendly A lot of people order to go!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite breakfast spots ive been too. This place has a southern feel, flavor, and atmosphere! This place is a most!!"}
{"text":"Big Grits Breakfast/ Chicken & Waffles  Everything was cooked to perfection! I have never been able to say that about any restaurant. I had the big Grits with Fried catfish, grits, a waffle, and scrambled eggs everything was fresh and seasoned well. The hubby had chicken and waffles that he's still raving about, and he's from the home of chicken and waffles. He said it's the best Chicken and Waffle he's had in Vegas and he's been here 12yrs. We will definitely be returning.   You can dine in however it's a small place. We actually had to wait for an available table and there is only like 12 max. They offer pick up and carry out. The staff is super! And attentive."}
{"text":"OMG!  Soooo good!  The place is small but the food is as sood as it gets.  The portions are just right -- actually, a little on the 'too much' side, so you'll definitely get your money's worth and leave FULL!  We were pleasantly surprised that someone came out to greet each customer at their table and ask how everything was and if we needed anything.  Since you order and pay at the register, this level of personal service wasn't expected, but definitely appreciated.  Gritz Cafe will now be a staple when we visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest it's a very small space, so if your coming with a large party you may have to wait. However it's worth the wait ! The waffles were so freshly made, light & fluffy with a little crisp to the edges. The waffle batter must be perfectly put together. My eggs could've been cooked a little longer !! But they were still very tasty ! Grits were amazing and perfectly made ! Lastly I originally started with fish that had a great taste but wasn't for me so I traded for chicken it too tasted great !! Great customer service ! Very accommodating to my group of 14 people ! Thank you for the patience and out standing service to me and my family :-)"}
{"text":"Emma and Kunta were awesome. This was Our first time and we arrived there 20 minutes before closing. We were not rushed in fact they encouraged us to stay and enjoy our meals while they closed the shop up. The food was amazing, my apologies, I forgot to get the chefs name but whomever was cooking was did a great job. Great place, and great service. If ever back in town we will most definitely be back. 5/5 experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had the Arkansas (chicken fried steak) eggs, biscuit...and MAC & CHEESE!!!! What's not to love people? My wife and her sister had the chicken and waffles (sorry no pic they were gone too fast). If your in a 20 mile radius of this place try it!"}
{"text":"I'm really torn to say whether I would give them two or three stars. For the most part I always get the turkey sausage grits bowl and its awesome the sausage is juicy and the eggs cheese and grits is that perfect compliment although it can seem a bit pricey for the portion just 1 small patty just doesn't stretch through your bowl well.   But on the other hand service means everything to me and I have to say the people working there are so ungrateful when it comes to you giving them your hard earned money. I find the cashiers to always be smug and cold very brief and unapproachable. I think that they should be required to go through some sort of customer service skills review or course or maybe the owner should reevaluate who behind the register because the are the first impression to their business."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, I had their chicken and waffles and my husband had their catfish.We waited for 20 min for our food but it was worth it because everything is fresh and made to order. The food is nicely flavored no hot sauce or special condiment needed. As far as the service, nothing to complain about . The only thing is they open at 7am-3pm I just don't understand why they would close so early with all the business they get.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat there again."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!!! I would rate them 5 stars however it did take FOREVER, to get our food.. BUT, it was so worth it and everything is made to order!!! If you come to Vegas and want some Bomb ass soul food, this is the place to try.. This will forever be on my to do list when I come to Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Everything was delicious!! We ordered: 1. Chicken & Waffles- waffles are similar to Roscoes ( for those of you that are familiar), but not as good as Roscoes but still very yummy!! Chicken wings were plump, crispy and cooked to perfection!!!  2. Ordered the link, fish, grits With sautéed onions & mushrooms and Mac n cheese!! The link had a little spice to it, but still BOMB!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, delicious food and a comfortable relaxed environment.  I had the po boy which was great, not too greasy but nice and crispy. Also had the mac and cheese and lemon cake, both good but the cake was so moist and big enough for three people to split.  The staff are great, so sweet and welcoming.  I will definately be going back soon."}
{"text":"One of the best hidden gems in Vegas. Great food,  shrimp & Grits to die for.  Grilled or Fried. Turkey saugage,  catfish, chicken, hot links,  potatoes etc. If your in Las Vegas and want something more for your this id the pkace."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend forgot to hit post but nevertheless..... Gritz Cafe was on point! Thick and creamy grits,  chicken seasoned well and fried RIGHT! My husband and the kids loved the waffles! It's small a small establishment but the friendliness, service, and great food make up for it! Will return when I come back to sin city."}
{"text":"When Looking at the reviews for this spot I was very compelled to reach out and try them.  First impressions are everything.  So I contacted them to cater for a party I was hosting.  Needless to say, after speaking with the owner.  She never fulfilled what she said she would do.  She never sent the quote to me.   I have tried to contact this person but never got a response back. It has been weeks and still no response.  Business owners need to know how important customer service is to preserve their business. At this point I am disgusted and have decided not to ever do business with this restaurant."}
{"text":"OMG... This place is a must try for breakfast... MY goodness, the grits are always on point (everytime I've had them), the cheese eggs and the fried catfish. yum yum yum... Delicious... Everytime I visit Vegas I make my way to Gritz.. :) Love this place...  The chicken wings are just as good. Yum yum yum.. Go ahead and try it. It's a hidden little place but it's worth finding and dining. The staff are always pleasant as well. Enjoy and happy eating.."}
{"text":"The Food is really good, Chicken wings are very big and juicy the grits are on point.  Every time I come to Vegas I will be back"}
{"text":"Gritz Cafe did not disappoint! While I was visiting Vegas I was able to put my west coast friends onto good grits!"}
{"text":"Good soul food! A order at the counter and take to go place, or stay and eat. It's a small place however there is a nice outdoor patio. There was a line, and a wait for the food, but that's to be expected for cooked to order food.   The food and service is what makes it 5 Stars! We had the country fried steak and the grits with eggs & bacon. My eggs were cooked perfectly over medium, the grits were perfect, and the country fried steak was delicious."}
{"text":"The food is great .. Lacks customer service.. I called to place a phone order i place half my order then said one sec and sneezed the girl on the line  said could you hold on because you dont know what you want and i got customers in front of me.. I thought that was rude  and immediately hung up.. Words of advice everyone that may call or come in may not  be familiar with the menu so patience and education is key,, educate customer on the menu they don't know if something is fried or grilled and be patient"}
{"text":"Make the trek to this side of town. unmatched hospitality and incredible food. group of 6 and we covered the menu with selections...everything was epic!  I personally had the Arkansas with eggs and home potatoes. best chicken fried steak around!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for sometime now, but was very disappointed.  The customer service is definitely lacking.  A mistake was made upon my order and when I mentioned it to the cashier, she appeared \"bothered\" , but proceeded to tell the cook the order change.  I then mentioned yhe price difference and she proceeded to tell me its the same price.  When I showed her the $2 difference, she was annoyed.  She then calculated my correct order plus tax and deducted it fron the price of my original order but neglected to add the tax i had already paid and proceeded to give me $1.27 back in change.  I mentioned it should be over $2 with tax because there is a $2 difference from the menu prices alone.  She disagreed and i just said forget it.  Mind you it is only $1 difference but it is the principle.  I should have kept my tip.  The food was average at best and the order came out wrong for both our dishes.  One had the wrong meat and the other had no cheese.  The server applogized, but the whole experience was disappointing and I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Gritz Cafe. I had no idea that it's been around for 8 years, wow! Getting here was easy, however, my GPS instructed me to turn left on Jimmy Ave. (which is actually to the right). Mount Moriah Dr is to the left (same street different name; Vegas be crazy like that, lol). Any who, Gritz Cafe is modest restaurant with dine-in or take-out options.  The cashier and wait staff were pleasant and quick. The prices are pretty awesome and you get nice sized portions. I had a State Plate, The Mississippi. So much food I was able to take some home for lunch.  Visit Gritz Cafe, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in the deep south, this place would be be one of the best restaurants back home. Can't be missed if this is your thing. Went for the first time and had catfish the catfish breakfast with potatoes and chicken and waffles with cheese grits.  Notice how virtually none of the \"bad\" ratings came from people who have actually been to this kind of restaurant before."}
{"text":"My friends and I live down the street from Roscoe's on Pico in LA and are big fan's but Gritz Cafe has won us over. We come to Vegas often  and Gritz Cafe had become part of our Vegas routine. We love this place and the staff is also very good. The short wait for a table or to get your food is very well worth it!!! Once at your table the staff is very good at anticipating your needs. This is a huge thing to me and they do a great job!!!"}
{"text":"Had the grits, greens and bacon. My man had the catfish...to die for! I will be back."}
{"text":"The grits were right at every turn: Right texture, right flavor, and right serving size. The chicken and waffles were both golden brown an very flavorful . Emma, our server was efficient and friendly. She made a great impression on us out-of-towners !!"}
{"text":"Gritz is very good. In fact it was surprisingly good! When your away from home, and can enjoy a \"home cooked\", affordable meal its impressive. I will definitely come back when in-town. The seating was not too bad. I believe the owners are truly on to something and can possibly expand or even franchise. One note of constructive criticism for the owners.....The young ladies that either were cleaning the tables or bringing the food to tables...well they were not the friendliest. A smile and a kind face goes along way. It can make or break a business. Honestly the only reason I did not rate it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had the catfish and grits and my husband ordered the burger with sweet potatoe fries. Delicious and fresh! We both enjoyed our lunch to the last bite. Good job ladies!!!!"}
{"text":"What a place grate food we are bright white got greeted and treated Grate. ! food was grate   !!! Southern sole food made with love baked in !! Super clean.  !!! Cute waitresses !!!"}
{"text":"Great service and not a long wait, we were greeted at the door and complimentary drinks but the food was plain and bland. Wouldn't recommend eating here"}
{"text":"This place has really great food and great service. The employees are down to earth. The only downside to this place is that it's a very small restaurant and it can get a little busy during certain times of the day, so you may have to wait a while for seating. Also the seating is very cramped. But their food is so good. I love home cooked style food. I think they need to relocate to a larger facility to accommodate more patrons. I would definitely recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"I came out to Vegas from the Bay Area for my 18th never been so was absolutely lost on where to go . My mom found gritz and from there we were in love. The hometown hospitality was awesome right when you walk in the greet you and talk to you the whole way. Absolutely great customer service and suck great workers and awesome fried gritz and gritz in general. If you need breakfast definitely come."}
{"text":"I constantly miss Southern food. Came by with a friend because I seriously needed a sweet tea and grits fix. Small restaurant, but nice layout. Friendly cashier and servers. Had a Groupon so the price was great. Got the Georgia (have to show some love to my home state) and a peach cobbler. The pork chops (grilled) were great, juicy and not too chewy. The eggs were perfect and the grits were great for dunking my pork chops in (there is no right or wrong way to eat grits). The cobbler had a lot of peach and was awesome!!! Super!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is hot,seasoned, and well portioned. It's nice to have soul food done right in Vegas. The staff is personable and attentive. The dining area is kind of small so no big parties but the turnover is quick so I've never had a problem finding a place to sit. Definitely a must visit if you are on the north side of Vegas"}
{"text":"Never having experienced \"soul food,\" I can only allow my review to go so far.  The staff was fantastic: polite, considerate. They made me feel warm and cuddly with their constant checking in. The propieter even made a round of the tables, asking the guests if they wanted water, a to-go box, etc.  I ordered their catfish basket with french fries; a Sprite on the side. My total was $11.35 for a good handful of seasoned fries, 4 pieces of free-range catfish that were at least 6\" in length and a huge soda. I could be prickly about the expensivity of the meal; however, ingredient costs have skyrocketed in recent months, so it's totally understandable.  Surrounded by good company and good food, I will definitely come here again. Thank you, Gritz Cafe!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant meet the owner Trina. Her customer service and the food defiantly will be back. I had the catfish filet and wings Mac and cheese and candy yams!! Everything was great will be back small location so you might wait but it's worth it. To go orders where moving fast though orders where coming out."}
{"text":"hit gritz for brunch last weekend.  pleasant little cafe, southern influenced.  sad to say, i could not try some of the southern specialties - had to settle for scrambled eggs, a hot link and some turkey sausage.  eggs - boring, but i don't hold that against them, the link - tasty, the turkey sausage was a little rubbery.  my guess, pre-cooked then reheated via the micro.  disappointed that they use all plastyic utensils, plates, etc.  but again, not a biggie.  this is the kind of local place that you hope will succeed.  and sorry, had to pass on the grits.  low carbin'"}
{"text":"Ordered the gritz bowl with chicken and cornbread,  and the mix and match with chicken, catfish, gritz with cheddar cheese, eggs and waffle on the side. Everything was perfect.  Small black owned and operated eith amazing food and service. I will Def go back. Excited to try the peach cobbler and a few other food items."}
{"text":"My SIL took us to Gritz while we were visiting. The chicken was delicious, I liked the waffle. After standing in line for a while and finally ordering we received our food fast.   The place is small but they seem to have a system that works. No holding tables and by the time you food is ready there should be a seat available. I did see them kick a couple of people of people out of their seats because they were holding tables while there were others who had already placed their order. The lady was really nice about asking her to allow the other people to sit down.   They can use a large menu so that it can be viewed while your standing in line."}
{"text":"I'm from Sacramento, ca and every time I'm in Las Vegas this is my first and last stop. This place is amazing"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a girls weekend and we were looking for a yummy breakfast spot and we found it. Its not located on the Strip and it was nice to wind down a bit during breakfast. The food was good and the added bonus was a nice lady outside selling soaps and body scrubs."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in North Las Vegas.  Delicious chicken and waffles. Friendly service,definitely a must on next visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had the healthy breakfast with egg white and turkey sausage and my bf had hot links, grits and eggs. We also shared a couple peices of catfish...all of it was delicious! The owner Trina and her staff really make you feel like family and come over to personally greet you! Love this place..will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food...I came here on an early Saturday afternoon with expectations to be waiting forever and the wait was not that bad. I've honestly waited far longer for food. The inside is pretty cramped and you have to keep an eye out in order to find a seat. However, because it was just me and one other person, we were able to snag a small, two seat table before our food came out.  I ordered the mix and match which comes with choice of two meats, two sides and a bread. I chose chicken wings, catfish, cheese eggs, grits and a biscuit. And, being the gluttonous person that I am, I also ordered a waffle because I really wanted one! I am glad that I did, because it was my favorite part of the meal. It is was slightly crispy but yet soft and it had a great taste. My only small gripe was the syrup wasn't high quality, but I am a little dramatic when it comes to syrup. Either way, the waffle was still bomb. So, after I crushed over the waffle for a while, I got to my main entree and it was delicious. The grits were perfect. In case you didn't know, grits are a science, but they got it right. The fish and chicken was crispy and flavorful and the eggs were perfect. No extra charge for cheese! Score. Unfortunately, I was overambitious and was full before I was even halfway through, but it was so worth it. The leftovers weren't as good, sadly, but I also didn't have anything to heat them up. So, don't let that stop you from munching on yours throughout the day, because it is likely you will have leftovers.  There was an awkward moment when, who I assume was a manager, became irritated with the cashier. I felt a tad bad for the lady because she was doing her best to keep the line moving and I didn't like how she made these comments in front of customers.  Anyway, I will definitely visit Gritz when I am back in Vegas. It is great food for reasonable prices and it is a pretty cheap Uber or Lyft ride from the strip, if you are from out of town. And, it is a relief from some of the other food options in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"I wouldn't necessarily consider them to be authentic as of late now that I've seen that majority of their food comes from CostCo. Not to mention, that they seemed to be using instant Gritz for their famous Gritz bowls. This saddens me as I've been a customer for years and the quality of the food seems to heading downward; especially with the premium prices they charge."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ten stars, I would! My boyfriend and I are originally from Mississippi and we felt right at home. Yes. The food is AMAZING. I got the grits bowl with a hot link and biscuit. He got the Alabama with thick cut bacon. The grits. Omg the grits. Absolutely nothing had to be added. Butter salt pepper, nothing. They were PERFECT. The biscuits were so soft and fluffy!! (My mouth is watering as I type) the hot link and bacon both surpassed expectations. walking in we were greeted warmly & asked if it was our first time.  We stated yes and were handed menus. Bc we went early around 8, only one table was taken. (The place is bigger inside that I thought after reading reviews so don't let that sway your opinion without going) We originally sat at the table for two Bc I knew from the reviews that they would fill up quickly and I didn't want us wasting a table for 4. We were approached and told to get a bigger table for elbow room! Lol Love it. The hospitality supersedes the food and that's saying a lot since the food is so good. Having the the talks with laughter with the workers and regular customers in the background while eating made the atmosphere so homey. & the music is bomb! My boyfriend had to tell me that I was singing along to every song while eating Bc I didn't even notice. Haha We will definitely make going the Gritz a weekly thing! As we were leaving we were told that they get busy around ten so try to make it before then. They open at 7. I've had it bookmarked for months and I regret not going earlier since it's only 2 miles away from me!!! LOVE IT! GO NOW!! NOW!"}
{"text":"Got the catfish pop boy my wife order the chick wing combo 8 wings with fries both us had fries .. The fish was greasy my sandwich was falling apart when I bit into it I can taste the grease in my mouth .. Our fries was soggy .. The wings didn't have flavor no sauce for the price she paid for the wings , wing stop would have been the best bet ... They said it was a good soul food spot in Vegas  sip my tea on that I've had better I will never be going back to this place the food was to greasy and soggy fries for the price I paid 28.00 could have ate better"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and it was on the way to work so figured we've give it a shot. It's kind of a hole in the wall place but the food was actually pretty good. I had the hot link and eggs and my friend had the 'Po Boy'. It was my first time trying catfish and I would definitely try it again. Staff was nice and the manager stopped by the table to see how everything was. An enjoyable breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"Finally made it, went for my cousins birthday.. small & I do mean very ! The food was good"}
{"text":"....a vendor delivered delicious chicken and waffles catered breakfast to the office.   Very good. The food traveled well. Waffels had good texture even after being packed up. Chicken was crisp and well seasoned. Grits were buttery and light.  Browsing the menu, the food must be great coming out hot from the kitchen and straight to the table."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough for the Vegas area. Whether you're a local or someone visiting you would be impressed by the food here. If you're visiting and don't have a car it's merely a $10 Uber ride which is more than worth it. If you do live in Vegas then it's literally five or 10 minutes from the strip.  It's family-owned which I always love because not only is it mom and pop can definitely see the mom-and-pop feeling here. It's like being in your own grandma's kitchen. The staff is friendly and will answer and help you out with any questions you may have. The food after the experience simply awesome. It taste like it was made with the personal touch and will keep you wanting more. We ordered everything from fish two waffles to fry chicken and we loved it all.  If you're looking for something outside of the norm of the normal dining in Vegas and don't mind going off script for a second then this is the perfect place for you!!  #EatHereOrNot"}
{"text":"The grits bowl is really good bacon cheese eggs over top of it had a side piece of fish and fried shrimp the (bomb)!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after reading a few reviews and I'm glad we did! It's a small little place so don't be surprised if you can't find seating for more than maybe 3-4 people. We went on a Sunday and it was definitely their busiest time and even though you order and seat yourself the staff is very attentive in making sure you have everything you need. We ordered the chicken and waffles and were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food but very limited space could barely fit the food for a table of 2 and I enjoy the grits bowl with a link an a over medium egg what I don't like is when it's cooked like a hard boiled egg"}
{"text":"When we visit Vegas we must stop here for a delicious down home style breakfast. The grits, eggs with cheese, fried catfish, fried chicken wings, homefried potatoes are FABULOUS!! Nice friendly environment, all smiles, just Good stuff. I will continue to come here when in town."}
{"text":"I like the food; I think I ordered a 'rich boy' sandwich.  It was really crowded when I went and there isn't a lot of parking because it's next to a beauty school.  I'd probably call-in  my order next time and just pick it up."}
{"text":"In town for a dance explosion and heard someone talking about delicious grits. Sooo we made the journey and was not disappointed.  PROS:  Fried catfish looked crispy n golden brown (I'm told it was seasoned very well). Grits very creamy n delish Bacon n wheat toast were standard Friendly service Served quickly Clean facility CONS: Small but quaint spot Under staffed (3) people to assist a full house (1 taking orders and delivering meals) 1 cooking and 1 ringing up the order  Would I go back? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Heading down South for my virtual lunch today. Ordered the fried catfish and grits with sweet tea. Crispy and creamy are always a great combo. Lunch was awesome, staff was friendly. Not an empty table in the place on a Wednesday. Finished it off with some scrumptious peach cobbler on a hot summer's day!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it. I wanted to fall in love all over again with chicken and waffles. But that was not to be. This love story fell apart well before the food arrived.   The store is crowded but I didn't mind standing. Unfortunately, a multitude of people came in with call-In orders that slowed the line down considerably.   We finally got a seat and the table was dirty. No worries, 20 minutes later it was cleaned. Another 20 minutes and the food was ready.   The order was the famous chicken and waffles, grits, sweet potatoes, bacon, and chicken. Being the first visit we wanted to sample most of everything.   The chicken was decent. A tad over fried and lacking seasoning but edible. The waffles/pancakes were terrible and tasted like they hopped from the Jiffy box straight to the plate. Another first date crushed.   For the lice, we were disappointed and the wait made it even worse. Save your dollars and keep looking. Perhaps a different menu item would be better but we went for the famous chicken and waffles and like the shiny casinos, left with less than we can with."}
{"text":"Good food , huge portions, I had the Chicken, Grits and Potato, food prepared well nothing undercooked, although they can lighten up on the Salt, the Grits were too salty. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"My husband & I had breakfast here on August 28, 2017 on advice from a friend. We were not disappointed. The food was amazing good hot and just Southern wonderful. Grits with Cheddar and fried chicken wings was a good meal for us. We will be back. The place is small best to order on line and pick up."}
{"text":"Just left Gritz cafe ordered 2 Bubbas ( Turkey Burgers ). It was thee WORST $16 I've ever spent. The menu says homemade but the patties were clearly frozen. The bun was old and hard. And on top of that it's extremely small. I counted 9 tables. The service was terrible. It took forever. I will not be returning. If you're from California you could compare the burger to a Tams turkey burger. Don't do it!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and Service!  I had the chicken and waffles with a side of grits.  Everything was seasoned perfectly!!!!  I absolutely Love well seasoned food...they nailed it."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I first rolled in and tasted a Grits Bowl with pork.  Fast forward a few years as the Breakfast Club was prepping to assemble..The question is pitched....\"Where we gonna eat?\"  And so it was Gritz.  Located across the street from the FBI building, you blink and you just might miss it.  If located, Gritz is small, clean and takes on home cooking in a simple yet sophisticated manner.  It's at the counter ordering and this includes the drinks.  When the cup (containing coffee) run empty, head to the counter.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  I ordered up the biscuits and gravy, each topped with a country sausage gravy and comes with two eggs (any style).  The biscuits were soft and the gravy divine. There is just enough to satisfy without saturating your plate.  Upon further reflection there is just enough gravy to keep you from going and ordering another batch, even though deep down inside you want to put yourself into a gravy coma.  NOW..for the name sake minus a slight change in spelling.  The grits are the best I have ever had.  They are of perfect consistency all the way through.  They do not convert to a slushy cream of wheat mixture the further down the bowl you go.  PLUS-you can add grits toppings for an additional 75 cents each.  Those toppings are cheese, bacon, mushrooms, onions or jalapeños.  I had cheese and bacon.....it was awesome.  The plasticware kind of sucks as I flicked a piece of biscuit in my hair BUT I get how it can keep cost down."}
{"text":"I usually never do reviews because places are usually just alright. However, this place is amazing! It reminded me so much of little cafes that I used to go to when I lived in savannah, Georgia. I ordered the chicken and waffles, the chicken was falling off the bone and super crispy as well as juicy. The hospitality by the employees was very friendly and I felt welcomed. I'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast restaurant once we arrive in Las Vegas. Always amazing food whatever we order."}
{"text":"We went to Gritz today for lunch it was an okay experience.  We didn't get get the good customer service everyone else's review described.  The food was good, but being a girl raised in the south I have had better.  The shrimp lacked taste. However; the grits with cheddar cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and onions were really good. The fried chicken was also good."}
{"text":"Heads up, this place is only open til 3PM on weekdays, making it difficult to hit Mon-Fri. I strategized and called in a takeout order as I left the office, and swung in at 3:05 full of apologies. They do open early for weekend brunches though, and serve breakfast all day.  Ordered the Richboy- a poorboy with fried shrimp, lettuce and tomatoes, and special sauce. Comes with a side of either grits or fries, and I went with the former as they're the namesake of this restaurant- added American cheese. Other add-on options include bacon, caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, jalapenos, egg, etc.- they def know variety with their grits. Total came to under $11.  Portion is enormous. 6\" hoagie doesn't look like a monster, but it's packed with 8 large fried shrimp and though my belly wasn't full after eating half, it was bursting at the seams after I forced myself to finish. Grits have great flavor and texture, and adding American cheese was delicious- would try with mushrooms and onions in the future, I've got my eye on the Grits Bowl for my next visit."}
{"text":"Great food but very limited seating if the place is busy it's very cramped and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I love Grits!!!!!! And this place has pretty awesome grits, now I don't have much to compare to within the valley, but I have had my share of bad grits.    Here you can get them with several toppings and the first topping is free. I got mine without any toppings and like I mentioned mmm -Awesome! We also tried the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was very good while unfortunately there was nothing spectacular about the waffle. We also had the \"Rich Boy\" which consisted of a generous amount of lightly battered shrimp on a hoagie with lettuce/tomato and their special sauce and this to my friends was so flavorsome!  I came here by a friend's recommendation to try their catfish and too bad we did not get to try it as we always over order so stay tuned cause we'll be back.  Can't WAIT!!!!   TIP: you can call and pre-order your food and be prepared to wait for a seat as the place is quite small and always packed so get there early!"}
{"text":"Bomb dot com! Is the best phrase to describe this establishment. My goodness the food here is amazing. I'm from New Orleans, LA and haven't found a good soul food resturaunt in Vegas yet. Every place I've been is all imitation. But Gritz Cafe, the best soul food business in town!  I order the Louisiana special for breakfast on my visit. Four grilled hot links, scrambled eggs with cheese, butter biscuits, and southern style potatoes were on my plate baby. I ate it all in about 3 minutes with room for seconds lol. The best breakfast I've had in years since my mama's cooking.  The sitting area is pretty small and seating is limited. The place was packed and we had to wait til a table cleared before we got to sit down. Thankfully a family was leaving before our food was ready or else we would've been forced to take our food to go. The pricing of the food was expected and worth every penny. But you can always call in your order before arriving.  I will definitely visit this resturaunt again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"The food there was excellent and the staff was great highly recommended if your ever in Las Vegas check them out"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I def stop here! Good vibes and good food! I love the catfish! Fried so bomb ! Everything be hot! Like I can't race enough about this place !   Yes they have cons kind of. It's small. But you know what they say about small packages !!   I do not like the seating situation... i feel it can be fixed with outdoor seating and music playing in dinning area.  Besides that it's clean efficient and smoke transactions.   :) thank you guys for hosting my family breakfast !!"}
{"text":"Nice food great parking. Clean and very friendly. With a Southern Flair. I think everyone every person should eat here at least once."}
{"text":"Delicious catfish! The eggs and english muffin that came with them were also good. Tried my friend's sausage and it was delicious too.   Service was friendly and the staff came by our table often. The only thing I was not sold on was the desserts. They said their grandma makes them, but they tasted store-bought and the sweet potato pie I had was frozen in the middle."}
{"text":"First timer here!   A small breakfast nook, with good food ! This was my first time trying chicken and waffles! The food was tasty, although the wait was a little disconcerting.   The staff was very nice !   One point of contention, we were charged a tip of .50 cents three times and I am not sure why?? We didn't order anything extra, or on the side.. The young lady charged us twice on our ticket .50 extra (twice) and the after our ticket printed another .50. It was almost as if she was building her own tips without our knowledge. Why am I tipping the person who just took my order? I would prefer to tip the waitress.   IF I decide to go back I will definitely watch out for this!"}
{"text":"wait time was good, staff very pleasant. the food looked promising. So my fiance ordered the Kentucky which is chicken wings with 2sides (potato & eggs) blah  I ordered the mix & match 2 meats 2 sides: 2wings, 2catfish with yams, greens, added mac n cheese and 6 butterfly fried shrimp. Everything was bland. the greens juice was damn near clear no seasoning what so ever. the yams were good needed more sugar. Overall not impressed and won't be back. I really want to find a good soul food place. I obviously have leftovers and when I get home I'll whip out some black & cayenne pepper and garlic for the greens for sure."}
{"text":"Super solid place. I would recommend this spot to anyone in Las Vegas trying to find a genuine southern meal. The sweet tea is fire get the muddy water (Arnold Palmer for the city folks)."}
{"text":"FINALLY!! I found chicken and waffles, that have made my life here in Vegas complete!! The food was well seasoned and the waffle was perfection!!   The staff was all smiles and genuine. It's a small place, in North Las Vegas. If you didn't know it was there, you'd probably drive right past it. I found my new spot to grub and be happy. I will definitely return for many visits in the near future to try the rest of the menu.   Southern comfort food at a great price!!"}
{"text":"The grits and fish were excellent. Service was good took and clean environment. They made us feel comfortable and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Out here in Vegas from LBC and man this is a must go to place every time we in town! Was recommended by locals while we were staying at hooters casino....."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing places to get your Soul food fix. Yummy and scrumptious, Gritz Cafe boasts of friendly staff members and down to earth customer service.  When we arrived the establishment is almost full of patrons, you order first and pay and get your seats while they deliver the food to your table when it has been cooked.  My sister who visited from San Diego is the one who told is about this place and naturally, we came here to give her what she wanted. It was a trip worth made! The food was made fresh and hot and the flavors of our dishes were all very savory. We were cared for very well by the staff.  This place is well and highly recommend by me to anyone who love Soul food. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I wanted chicken and waffle in Las Vegas and goggle to find it, read a few reviews and decided to try it out. It is off the beaten path, only locals knows this place, as it is not that near the strip and nestled in residential area and some offices. Who knew that this place would have the best fried chicken and waffle. The batter on the chicken was very good, they ran out of whole chicken parts and used wings instead - no complain there. It was \"oh..so..good\"! Beside the chicken and waffles, we tried the chicken fried steak with gravy and finish off with a peach cobbler. Pricing is reasonable. I rather eat here than stand in the buffet line to eat mediocre food. Gritz café, you have my 110% vote!"}
{"text":"One of my friends recommended that we try this place while in Vegas. It is located in the Arts District and only a 15 min drive from the strip.  We were lucky enough to get in before the crowd.  I ordered chicken and waffles and my boyfriend ordered Catfish with a Louisana link on the side. We both agreed that the grits were absolutely phenomenal. We know and love grits. I had my with cheese and it was so good. It was creamy and just right. So A+ for the grits.  The chicken was seasoned well. So well that even my \"to-go\" several hours later was still tasty. The fish was piping hot and my boyfriend vacuumed that all up. LOL! He was literally inhaling his meal.  I would say my only disappointment was the waffle. It was a little overcooked and I didn't enjoy as much as my other food.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful. They gave me an at home type of feel. I recommend making your way to the Arts District and trying Gritz Cafe."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Service was *****!! However...... food took too long and was  cold by the time it hit our table. We need to do better my colored folks.  Just make a meal at home Thanks"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm a good and this is the perfect place for me. The catfish is to die for. An their portion sizes are large as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is literally in the neighborhood, so I am constantly there. The Gritz bowl is my favorite and the Kentucky is the runner up! They are now selling rice Krispy treats, so my desserts are covered! I wish they would stay open later so I wouldn't have to go anywhere else to eat! Trina! Help a sister out! Lol"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle is better than Roscoes!!! I just couldn't eat a lot of the chicken because they had steroid wings, but the taste and seasoning was delicious. Waffle was delicious! Also would prefer to eat with glass plates and real utensils. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"I first came here in 2013 at the recommendation of an old lady who helped me at the local post office as I prepared to go overseas for a few years. Upon coming back to Las Vegas for vacation, I really wanted to see if this place was as good as I remember from 3-4 years ago. It was.  This is an African-American owned establishment that excels in very good savory cuisine. I absolutely LOVE chicken and waffles and have had them at Roscoe's in LA and Harlem at multiple joints, and this place hands down is better.  Since I stay on the new strip for vacation, it is about a $6-10 UBER to get here but well worth it.  They have ample parking if you have a car on your vacation, so that saves you on the taxi fare.   The establishment is decently sized, as you come in there is a trash can to your right and clean bathrooms for men and women behind a partition wall. As you look ahead from the entrance you see the counter where a nice person always greets you. 3-4 years ago it was a elderly lady, this time it was a younger lady, both were amazingly nice. You order at the counter and grab a seat. Unfortunately, their Credit Card machine does not allow you to leave a tip, so if you intend to use card, I recommend bringing some cash to drop in the tip jar.  There are about 5-8 4 person tables and a few 2 person tables in the joint but I would not call the seating area huge. Your orders are made from scratch so expect to wait about 15-20 minutes for them to get your order together. As I said above, I love chicken and waffles so I always get it with the wife. It runs about $11 an order, you get 4 giant wings (flat & leg) with a waffle. With 2 drinks and a side order of a red hot, the bill came out to $33 after taxes.   The food as always comes out hot, to order and amazing. The hot sauce goes perfect with the nice crispy hot wings. I will be back again in the future as long as this place stays open. While we were eating about 10 other couples rolled through so it is really popular.  Just realize they close at 3pm, so make sure you plan accordingly if you intend to stop by."}
{"text":"Yesss lawd, YES! Everything was delicious and soulful. Catfish fried to perfection, light crispy and seasoned exactly right. Waffle so delicious and my eggs are cooked exactly as I requested. Our service was on point and our food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. I was very impressed with the robust flavor in every bite. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Omg! Better than Waffle House, better than Roscoes chicken and waffles. If I could give them 10 stars I would. Everything on the menu looked so good. Had the chicken wings and cat fish. Soo soo good. Can't wait to take the drive back to Vegas for this spot !!  All the staffs members are so sweet and welcoming"}
{"text":"If you like a southern breakfast this little cafe is a must go.  Nice decor, friendly and welcoming staff.  I had a breakfast with eggs, potatoes and catfish - all good and the catfish was amazing with their super delicious hot sauce.  Biscuits and gravy fantastic too.  My only small complaint would be that the unsweetened iced tea is actually sweetened."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but always get my food to go. I decided to dine in today. Food was good; cooked to order, very flavorful, and moderately priced. No complaints about the service, everyone seemed to be very attentive and helpful.   Only reason that I won't give 5 stars is because of the size of the restaurant and the hours of operation. There's only about 8-10 tables available, so you're lucky if you're able to get a seat. Gritz closes at 3 pm, so this is definitely not a dinner option."}
{"text":"I was ready to go in the back to see if my grandmother was cooking. I hadnt had gritz in so long too!!! It tastes like love. There is not scimping on the portionm size these servers are generous. LOL i had the Kentucky plate and my GF had the fish ( which ever plate that is) but it was crazy delicious and we were stuffed. The waitress turned the tables over pretty fast and its a place for all ages. xoxoxoxo we love yall and will be back soon"}
{"text":"I could literally never get sick or tired of this place from the amazingly golden fried chicken to the perfect battered catfish and thick creamy buttery grits in their cheesy cheesy macaroni and cheese to everyone who works there with their awesome energy and spirit I feel like I'm at my moms kitchen although I'm not I love the Arkansas plate grits bowl fried chicken platter fried fish platter hotlinks cornbread waffle everything"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Customer service was great. Place was very busy. Dine in area could use more space. Pork chops a bit fatty but customer service made up for it. Good experience for my first time."}
{"text":"Officially my fave Vegas breakfast spot w/o alcohol. Grits were great,  large portions, and prices are fair. I didn't care for the waffle (too dense) but wings and catfish were well seasoned. It is small inside and they may benefit from accepting online orders. Also need wifi."}
{"text":"OMG! I need this place to expand to the bay area and LA. The food here is amazing. If I lived out there in Vegas, I would come everyday. Came here with my friends, and we each ordered something different so we can try out multiple items. Had their gritz, catfish, chicken, shrimp, waffle, and biscuits, and everything was excellent. Didn't have a microwave in the hotel for our leftovers and ate our food cold and it was still good. Don't pass this place up when you're in Las Vegas. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My cousin took me to this spot on our way out of town. Very cool spot where the employees treat you like they have known you for years. My chicken wings were freshly fried and served piping hot. Waffles and breakfast potatoes accompanied my chicken. Too full for the breakfast potatoes, but they're cooked perfectly if you have the room."}
{"text":"Great food! Takes a while but worth the wait! Had wings , Mac n cheese chicken waffles greens. O my!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here and absolutely love their breakfast!  Good thing we came today (Easter) as it wasn't crowded and their was no wait.  You order at the counter and pay for your food and they bring it to you when ready.  I had the fried catfish with eggs over medium, grits with cheese and cornbread.  Perfectly fried, grits were perfect  and everything was tasty and delish!  Coffee was good too!  Other items my fam got were fried chicken wings, hot links and waffles.  Everyone was pleased and full.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! My wife thinks I'm crazy but catfish, eggs, and grits are the best! Everything was tasty and the service was good as well. They are out of the way, off of MLK, but worth the drive. Their coffee could be better too, but not bad."}
{"text":"Two things I love the most in this world - my girlfriend and soul food !  Came here for breakfast with a friend of mine, and I felt like I was back home with my grandparents . Tables and seating are a first come, first serve basis ( you seat yourselves. ) The cafe' itself is small and definitely a mom & pop joint, which are always my favorite. The staff was very friendly, but the prices were a bit high, but it was worth it. Home cooked breakfast for sure , the meals did not come with a beverage so be prepared to pay for that separately .  I ordered the Hot link combo that came with eggs of choice, side of choice and toast or cornbread . The Hotlinks were spicy and juicy, just the way I like them. I choose fried eggs, Grits(perfectly cooked and seasoned) and Cornbread( moist and sweet) 5/5 everything was very good and reminiscent to my grandmothers cooking . I can't wait to come back again!   A must eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"2nd time here. And it's official. My favorite breakfasts place. For more than reasonable prices, the food is delicious & the portions  are just right. I love Egg & I on Sahara, but to much food & they're really only good for omelettes.This place has a little of everything you could ever want for breakfasts plus excellent grits. Plus the mushrooms. Yum yum. Just as good as the grits at Lola's."}
{"text":"The best ever I can not say no more. I love this place. They are the greatest the people the food omg I looked everywhere for Turkey substitute and this restaurant did it. I just wish they could only stay open a little longer till I'm off work. Bomb.com"}
{"text":"Very impressed with Las Vegas Southern Comfort Cuisine now. I had the chicken and waffles and grits and my company had fish macaroni and cheese and greens I got to taste everything and everything was on point. Chicken very crispy on the outside with good flavor juicy on the inside the Grits were great I'm not a great person but very creamy these people know what they're doing with bacon and cheese on top it was a hit. Macaroni and cheese was okay it was not authentic as I thought it would be very saucy not box but Velveeta I believe. Good flavor in the waffle the customer service was awesome. Just small if you are looking to sit down and eat there's only about 10 tables to do so and very close to each other it's it's best to order in and take it to go."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!!! We waited OVER AN HOUR for our food!!! They kept refilling out drinks and saying \"its coming\" it was to the point of them about to close that they were about to fix our food. They gave us free dessert and put our items in togo containers but we were dining in. This place was a MESS on a Sunday and I can't say I would go back.  The food wasn't the best but the waiters were decent."}
{"text":"My go to soul food restaurant in Vegas. I'm born and bred Louisiana and know a great fried catfish and chicken plate and this place delivers. And the service is great, to boot!  The only complaint I could ever have is that they need more seating. There are worse problems!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The next time I visit Vegas I will try to make it back. There is a small southern feel this establishment which was a major plus. The food was cooked to perfection and I use to be a real big boy so when it came to the grits I was extra watchful. However the grits were cook perfectly. The service was great also. It's always great to see \"black owned and operated\" done in excellence."}
{"text":"Okay let's just start off by saying these are some of best chicken wings I have had ever and I have eaten A lot of chicken wings; they are huge, lot of meat on them (I wonder where they do get those huge pieces and the chickens they get them from:); the favoring is excellent and it's friend chicken but the batter is not heavy or oily at all; the grits with cheese, yams and greens were very good, cornbread was okay; the Only reason why they are not getting a 5 star rating from me is that the rich boy was lackluster compared to that spectacular chicken; the pieces of shrimp were a very nice size but it lacked flavor which was disappointing; but you will not be disappointed in their delicious chicken :) FYI I cannot speak on the seating because I got take out; it does look small inside but in my experience around the country most soul food cafes are small establishments; just saying"}
{"text":"Hand down the best breakfast in Las Vegas, the place is small but they have really good service. Your food comes out quick and it's hot. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I suggest you go early we went around 830 and it wasn't crowed, and was starting to fill up. The grits and breakfast potatoes were off the chain, will be going back often."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on the Internet and wanted to try it out.  I was pleased beyond measure.  We ordered the catfish and grits with a hot link on the side.  The grits were seasoned perfectly, creamy and ohh so delicious.  The eggs were scrambled with cheddar cheese and the hot links were grilled and had a spicy kick to it.  The waitresses were pleasant, kind and efficient.  The only drawback was the restaurant is small and can only accommodate a few people at a time.  Every time we come back to Las Vegas, this will be a \"must go to\" stop!"}
{"text":"The Chicken & Waffles are great !!!  Very friendly staff. The Gritz are always perfect !!! I go every Saturday morning & treat the office staff."}
{"text":"It's a classic gritz place! Not many healthy or salad options, but well that's not what you going there for anyways.  Could use a change of deco"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant, I had chicken and waffles, but I must say I will be ordering the grits next time.  Trina and her staff are so pleasant, we had a great time interacting with them.  This is our new eating spot while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of grabbing a bite to eat at this little gem of a diner.   The food was super delicious; however, this location is small doesn't offer much dining area.   Beside the long wait for seething, I had an awesome experience."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it really makes a difference whether you order in or out, but with the grits cafe that might be the case. I ordered to go because I had training for my job. My boyfriend ordered the big breakfast and I got a waffle and a side of cheesy grits. Well... Instead he got cheesy eggs and I got plain grits. ( blah )  I'm not really one to complain or ware food. I ate some of the grits and focused on my waffle. Standard waffle, we pretty good. No complaints there.   Maybe next time we'll eat inside and it will be different. Willing to try again."}
{"text":"A1 Soul Food and the staff is great. No matter how long I've been gone they always remember me. Prices are great for the portions."}
{"text":"This place is everything and some!!! I had a wonderful \"soul food\" meal that put M & M soul food to shame! This restaurant is a must try... kissing the grits is not good enough... \"if u like it, put a ring on it'. Shoutout to all the employees  at the location. The were personable and on point"}
{"text":"Had very high expectations for this place.  Overall, it just was mediocre.  The service was plenty friendly and the people were polite.  Overall, it is as follows for my breakfast experience:  The good: - The prices were reasonable for the amount of food.  4 large wingsm a biscuit, a juice, some potatoes and grits were like $14. - The potatoes were tasty, with onions and green peppers in them. - The grits were creamy and smooth.  They have a variety of things you can mix into them.    The bad: - The food came out around 5 million degrees Celsius.  I want fresh and hot food, but daaaaamn, after 10 minutes sitting on my plate, a piece of fried chicken hit me in the face after I broke the wing, and it scalded me.  The food was HOT coming out.  Too hot for me.  I want to be able to eat within a few minutes. - The potatoes were mushy.  The breakfast potatoes, while tasty, were way overcooked.  They were pretty much mush. - The biscuit was the size of a silver dollar, and was hard as a rock.  Took 2 bites, but it was like hard drywall.  I am sure I just got a stale one, but still. - Minute maid or some other kind of concentrated orange juice.  I get not everyone is going to make fresh OJ, AND the juice here is very reasonably priced, since it is concentrate.  I mean, I think a big OJ is like $1.50 or something, which is fair for what it is.  I just would like some real juice. -Plastic silverware, paper plates and Styrofoam containers, even if you are eating in.  I don't know, but for me, eating out of plastic and Styrofoam affects the taste of the food, just like drinking Coke out of a glass bottle improves it. -The fried chicken was pretty \"meh\" for me.  It was not bad by any stretch, and I certainly would not have any issues eating it, but I would not seek it out and I was not blown away by it.  I was expecting some incredible bird after the reviews I read, but no so much.  Overall, it was a big let down for me, but was not horrific.  I would consider trying it again for lunch for a shrimp po' boy or something to see if it was good, but breakfast is pretty much done for me.  On an unrelated note, an eclectic mix of customers, from people in shirts and ties to people sporting various neck tattoos."}
{"text":"The food here is not only affordable, but absolutely delicious.  I ordered the mix and match with wings and catfish and everything was perfectly cooked.  The Po boy was also good."}
{"text":"The food is great however...The staff has problems with communication skills. First you can spend 30 bucks in their. And they will give u a tiny cup of water. What am I to do with this like...I'm thirsty not trying to brush my teeth. Their rude staff sucks big time! We are in Nevada if I spend money why not give a nice size cup of water its a desert out their. They seem to look down on you because you don't want a soda. But I just spent 30 bucks ugh! Now I have to spend 2 more bucks for water. lol Last I checked tap water is free. Its not as if they give you bottle water. Also I asked if the pudding is made from scratch. I was told yes. So I bought the pudding. However when I got home I could not believe my eyes. The pudding was box made. I Deceive you not people.  So I jumped back into my SUV and ran back across town to gritz. I was met by the same older lady who had lied to my face. OMG you think you can trust someone thats old enough to be your grand mother.  Ugh! but anyway when I told her why I was back and that I wanted a refund she gave a piss poor excuse as to why she deceived me. She said I think of gritz cafe as my home so I used box pudding and to me thats home made.  I replied only a person who cant cook would give an excuse such as this. Gas is not cheap and you lady just are a pure liar. She wasted my time and money. If I return I will only be getting catfish and maybe chicken I have had both those dishes and they were great."}
{"text":"Im happy i came across this rest, never in my life had i tried ck and waffles!  I absolutely loved the food it was worth waiting in line. The customer service was great very nice people."}
{"text":"The food was great,  the service and location was ok. The price was completely reasonable.  I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Food is still very good . But Three separate times I have ordered and when my food comes I'm told there is no macaroni and cheese left. Each time was months apart . It makes no sense to run out of macaroni and cheese at 12pm. Also it is very hard to get a table to sit at because they have only about  8 tables inside and a high volume of customers. Oh yea 40 plus minutes to wait on your food to come out"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden Gem. Food is tasty, fresh and the combinations they offer are fantastic!:)"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD... My family and I were on vacation from Miami and Ohio and I read about the Gritz Cafe on Yelp and I'm so glad we went there. The food was Absolutely Divine. Emma gave us Outstanding service, the staff was so friendly and helpful. The catfish, gritz and chicken was mouth watering.  You will not be disappointed if you go there to eat. We are planning our next year vacation and can't wait to return back to the best. \"Gritz Cafe\"."}
{"text":"For me this place is a home-run!!!  Perfect Grits! Not too dry, not too runny, seasoned but not salty... Just creamy goodness!  Catfish is crunchy, firm, seasoned perfectly.  Fried shrimp... again with perfect seasoning, perfectly cooked!  Coworkers got a Turkey Burger (really?!?), Chicken sandwich and Hot Links.... Everyone has same reaction... \"Mmmmm, You found a winner, MMMMmmmm\". Staff was lovely... In fact, everyone in the place was lovely... Odd that hearing people say \"please and thank you\" is the oddity these days but it abounds here!  I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Heard about this spot from a friend, and decided to hit it up while in town for a convention. I must admit, it was the best soul food I've had in a while, and I'm from TX, so I know good soul food. The fried chicken was second to none!!! Only downfall was the size of the joint, but it was well worth the wait. This spot is a must, when visiting Vegas....don't sleep on it!"}
{"text":"ate here again!!!! this time my parents were in town from Michigan ... my mom is from Georgia and KNOWS soul food... they LOVED IT!!!!!!! Dad had chicken and waffles LOVED IT... Mom and I had the catfish and gritz with cheddar and jalapeno and BF had catfish on a sandwich.. i think its called po-boy catfish sandwich.. SO YUMMY!!! We will be back again soon!! again and again and again!!!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken was the bomb, so delicious. The waffles came to me soggy because they put  butter on them. I like to put my own butter on my waffles. Good service and friendly atmosphere. I will go back again."}
{"text":"The grits were ON POINT. I got the fried chicken and waffle. Super hot fire. Had to dock a point 'cause the lady up front barely understood English, so it literally took like 20 minutes just to order my food. But other than that, the food was hella good. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hats off to Gritz's food was excellent and the customer service was great. This will be my new breakfast SPOT when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Gritz has a very welcoming atmosphere. The service was friendly. Be ready to wait a bit because  the food is cooked to order. Delicious home cooked breakfast. I got turkey sausage with cheesy eggs, grits and a biscuit. Wonderful grits. Creamy and cooked through. The biscuits were delicious. I tried the fried chicken and it was amazing! Love to support establishments owned and operated by my people."}
{"text":"Great food.. I usually put sugar on my grits but decided not to this time so I can see what the big hype was about the grits.. Glad I didn't go with the sugar this time, these grits were the best grits I've ever had! The chicken was good but it could've been cooked a little longer. The waffle was good.. The potatoes were a little dry but we're still good. The staff was nice and friendly, I will be a returning customer when I visit Vegas again"}
{"text":"We finally made it to Gritz Café. This spot is definitely a winner. It seems to be a neighborhood gem as it definitely does not lack customers.  The portions are large enough to share; however, I'm not sure if all will want to share. The grits are creamy, very creamy. If you have a passion for cream, you'll find it here. I, too, enjoyed the catfish. It's an abundant amount (4). The coating is a seasoned cornmeal. The chicken wings are as good as they look. The floured dredge is lightly seasoned. I appreciate the hint of onion powder! We could not leave without trying the waffle. If you like a waffle that a bit of a crisp outer edge, this is the one. That's a sign of BUTTER in the batter . . . Mmmm! Their coffee is good. I appreciate the option of flavored creamers, if that's your preference.   The only negative I'd give this establishment is its small dine-in are continuous customers base, we were able to snag a table in minutes. (I'm not sure how much of that was luck . . . )"}
{"text":"I love this place my honey always to take me early in the morning before work and we will get grease eggs bacon with the toast on the side and it's so good so good I love it."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! The service is superb! This is a really small establishment so be prepared to take your food to go, and of course you're going to wait a minute they cook it to order - every trip to Vegas We stop here. That Chicken though!!!!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Well, with the good comes the bad.  I heard about this place a couple of weeks, and being from the South, I know and love good grits - so I was excited to try it, and willing to drive across town to do so.  We arrived Sat morning, and had a fun conversation with the lady (she was wonderful) at the register (you order and pay first).  She said these would be the best I've had.  But I never found out. I ordered biscuits and gravy with grits, but I never got my grits (the biscuits and gravy were okay).  I went back and stood at the counter, and after a couple of minutes I got the server's attention and told her they missed the grits on my order.  She said okay, turned around and went about her business.  I waited, and waited, and finished everything else I had, and waited a little longer. Never got my grits."}
{"text":"Hubby and I loved it!! I'm originally from Georgia and the grits here get 2 high fives!! Put this breakfast spot on you must visit list!! They take a little while cooking, but it is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a 'soul food' restaurant before and I'm not exactly sure on how much entrees are supposed to cost, but the prices of their entrees were priced between $10 and $15, about as much as an Olive Garden. There are smaller sandwiches for less than $10, but I'm not a sandwich type of girl.  Nonetheless, I thought the food was pretty good. The catfish was delicious. I also had greens, but it didn't taste as good as homemade. The cornbread was okay; I've had better.  The waiters were really attentive. This could have been due to them being really nice or the place being super small; there were less than 10 tables. So, if you plan on bringing a big party, you might want to set up a reservation (if they take them) or just head somewhere else.  I would definitely go back though. I want to try the rest of the menu and the people were very nice."}
{"text":"We ate here b4 returning to LA! Food was great and so was the service. My grand daughter, who is very finicky even ate all her food. When back in Vegas, we'll definitely return to Gritz Cafe."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! First time here & will return for sure!! I tried the Kentucky: Chicken fried steak, eggs, grits, & toast. The chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly & the grits were AMAZING perfect consistency and flavorful. This place is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast spot for good southern home down flair. It has everything. Grits, meats, macaroni and cheese, yams, waffles etc. If you know soul food this is your place and if you don't, coming here will make you a believer. Not much seating in the dining area but it is clean and intimate. There may be a line but it's well worth the wait. Great customer service and you walk in feeling like family."}
{"text":"Great food. Only problem is the wait is too long. 3 times in a row waited almost an hour for my food. They need to figure this problem out. SERIOUS PROBLEM."}
{"text":"Waited in line 25 minutes to have my order taken only to finally get to the register and the cashier still wasn't ready to take an order (there was literally only 2 people ahead of me when I walked in).   The owner was screaming at the cashier to check the receipt paper on the register so that she could take another order, meanwhile the cashier is continuously talking to a customer about a repossessed BMW he sold her.  I walked out.. After standing there all that time , I walked out with nothing, without even placing an order. The food there is half way decent but the customer service and professionalism are non existent in this place. I'll never go back here again.   Try Baby Stacks bkfast spot, a little distance but has amazing food and grade A service. I'm at Baby Stacks every other weekend and Grits Cafe doesn't even compare."}
{"text":"I live in the greater Los Angeles area, and I make Gritz my first stop when I come to visit my sister in Henderson; yes that's correct I pass her house and come to GRITZ first.   Service is exceptional from one of the servers (did not get her name - middle age and hair was in a curly ponytail)  all the servers was very good.  Food, need I  say anything more if I pass my stop and come here first!!!!!  Cashier great!!  Next time I will get names  Love this place, the only reason not a five -- I never give them, because there is always room to grow! But if I did this place would be a five!"}
{"text":"Thanks you Yelpers for your great review on Gritz café.  My daughter and I were doing our girls family trip.  I asked my daughter what she wanted for breakfast and she said fried chicken.  I didn't want to go anywhere on the strip so I found Gritz Café.  With the great reviews to the mouth watering pictures.    We came here around 8am on a Sunday and it wasn't too crowded.  This place can probably hold up to 20 people.  The servers are very nice.  I wanted to order two Chicken and Waffles plate ($12) the cashier said that it will be too much food and $24.  So she recommended me to get 1 chicken and waffles plate and a waffle on the side ($3.50).  I'm so glad I took her recommendation,  the wings were HUGE, crispy and tasty.  The waffles were moist and flavorful.    I will definitely go here again for the great food and wonderful people."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite southern food joint in town! Please extend your hours and move to a bigger location!!  Only open from 7am-3pm daily- offering breakfast/lunch dishes. The restaurant itself is tiny! Maybe 10 tables max? And only two tables outside. On a Saturday morning my husband and I were huddled in a corner waiting for our food debating if we should eat in the car! But it was definitely worth the wait.  Catfish- amazing! Finally found a place that makes it like Catfish Alley (so sad that they closed!) Breaded with cornmeal and perfectly crispy. A little strange to have it for breakfast but I wasn't going to complain.  Gritz? What are gritz? Never had them before and not sure how they're supposed to taste... but I finished the whole bowl. They were delicious. Good flavor and had the consistency of a thick cream of wheat. Add cheese and bacon and you'll be in heaven.   Overall: everything is made to order and comes out amazingly fresh and delicious. Very small restaurant so maybe order togo if you don't have a table."}
{"text":"We went for mid-day breakfast today.  My husband and son had the waffles and wings which they enjoyed.  I had chicken fried steak, which was covered in gravy not just a dollop like most places.  We all agreed that it was better than the last place we had chicken fried steak.  My husband can't wait to go back to try their catfish and sides.  Will tell his friends about this place."}
{"text":"I use to really like the place, however lately for the price you pay the food is less and less.  I went there this morning and paid over $9.00 for gritz, 1 sausage patty, and what I believe was half a egg.  Yep half a egg!!!!  No toast, when I specifically asked for wheat toast.  I try a patronize the business in my neighborhood but I don't like to feel like I'm getting ripped off!!!"}
{"text":"My Husband & I were driving around looking for a good breakfast restaurant, when we stumbled upon The Gritz Cafe. Best decision we have made since moving to Vegas! The service was amazing!!! Everyone was so kind and friendly, checking on us and made us feel at home. The food was excellent! The grits were so flavorful and I loved the waffles, even the music was nice! This is definitely our new spot!!"}
{"text":"Okay this place was bomb! The ONLY con was the wait was long on the Fried Chicken. Besides that the service was awesome,  the waiters, cashier everyone was super duper friendly and the food was Beyond good! Chicken was fresh out the grease and seasoned to the bone! The grits didn't need nothing! I highly recommend Grits Cafe!"}
{"text":"The catfish and grits are so good. Eggs, Bacon, cornbread is so yummy.  I can't wait to eat there again"}
{"text":"Staff was amazing, food was above average home style food, place just felt comfortable. We had chicken, waffles, grits and eggs $ bacon."}
{"text":"I like to support Black business's and this one was worth the drive, the wait, and the price! I was there this weekend, 1st time, and the grits were on point, I've never seen so many kinds...and the service was excellent.   Lotta times folks talk about how Black business's can be...from my perspective ANY business can be mixed. From the young brother at the counter to the table service asking if we were good, Gritz deserves \"5 stars\"...which btw I never give to keep folks on their toes. This place deserves all of em!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good but the lady who took my order was very rude and ghetto. And she talked to me like I was a child when they was they ones who mixed up my order."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!! The food and service was awesome!!!!! This is the place to go for some great tasting food.  Grits were cooked to perfection and the fish fried just right. I drove in from Moreno Valley, ca and this will be one of my favorite places to eat when in Vegas. Also the staff here are very nice and genuinely care about giving great service. Down home cooking at its best."}
{"text":"Gritz Cafe is great. Went there and tried the Fried Catfish...hmmmm ..good. One of the best soul food place around. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Might be a fine place if you are not a transracial family with small children.    We are, and when the server came to deliver our waters and my coffee she said \"you need to get your kid under control, we don't have insurance for stuff like that\" (he had been walking between where I was sitting at the table and where my husband was ordering). I respected her comment and turned to tell my son that he needed to stay in his seat. As I was turned she put our waters in the middle of the table, and my coffee in front of my 15 month old daughter. My daughter grabbed it and screamed, and when I turned back to attend to my daughter the server said \"See, what did I tell you?\" I grabbed the kids and told my husband we needed to go.  They were sure to charge us for the coffee. Very disappointed in the way my children and I were treated."}
{"text":"Really friendly service and the food was delicious.  I had chicken wings, fish and grits.  Their food is well seasoned"}
{"text":"Wow! I think amazing. I had the Arkansas chicken fried steak and eggs... omg. So good. Crispy steak, home fries, eggs, and a English muffin. So tasty  My roommate had the club sandwich. Oversized and he loved it! Well be back over and over again. :)"}
{"text":"This is by gar the best chicken and waffles i have ever had.  The grits were great.  Definitely the most friendly family restaurant in Las Vegas.  It is a must go any time your in town.  The prices are great."}
{"text":"Great hearty breakfast place to come too for a good meal that will satisfy and fill you up. I got the grits bowl with a hot link, comes with eggs however you like them and your choice of bread (white, wheat, English muffin) awesome flavor. Also a side of homestyle potatoes and a piece of catfish fried to perfection.  If you have a case of the \"hangry\" then you may want to call in your order. There is a little wait on ordering your food but it is worth it. Small dining but you an eat outside as well. Good place to come and get some soul breakfast."}
{"text":"1st pic: #chicken and #waffles   I like my waffles soft and was initially wary about how crunchy the first bite was, but after the syrup had a chance to soften those bad boys up, I was transported to a world of sweet, soft buttery goodness.   Wings were quite juicy. Breading wasn't too. thick. Next time I come, I might get catfish and waffles cuz they liked pretty good too. Note: One order of chicken and waffles comes with four large wings which was more than enough for this chubster. Glad Daniel was there to split it with me and catch my good side.   The seating area is small and it was crowded  initially but the turn-around is quick so we didn't wait that long at all to order and get a for a table for two. (Order first, then seat yourself) Service was good. Shouts to Nu-nu for being so nice."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting this lovely establishment with my family this morning and It's truly a gem! The food was made to order and the taste was amazing! Everybody's food was delicious! The service was absolutely phenomenal and I cannot wait to come back!  Thank you to the amazing staff & owner!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing.  The service is impeccable I really feel like I'm back home in the South everytime I stop by,  Not matter what you get Collard Greens, Mac 'n' Cheese, Grilled/Fried Catfish, Shrimp Po'Boy...  Its all good..."}
{"text":"When in VEGAS- Gritz Cafe is a must for breakfast! We ordered several items so we had a pretty good sampling- hotlinks, whole wings, party wings, catfish- and of course Gritz! Everything was delicious! My hesitation for 5 stars is totally based on service. Gritz is totally busy- so calling in the order took a certain level of commitment."}
{"text":"This establishment may be small but it is great.  The food is excellent, everything I have tried so far has been good.  I think I am addicted to there grits.  I could eat them everyday.  They are creamy and just the right consistently.  I have ordered them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Yes they are all that.  There yams are die for and the macaroni and cheese is great. The catfish is really good.  For some reason I can just eat the sides.  Love there home fried potatoes.  I just ordered the chicken fried steak and gravy, haven't tried it, but it looks good.  Tomorrow I tackle the chicken wings, I understand there is a special on Thursdays.   Don't forget to try the lemon cake,  you will love it.  I have talked so much about the food but let me mention the service is excellent.  Staff tries really hard to make sure you have everything.  They were busy on Sunday but I was still greeted. with a smile.  It is probably better to order take out.  If it is crowded it can be a challenge to find a seat.  There is seating outdoors when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"This might be my new fav breakfast spot; smells like moms chicken grease, next to a beauty shop, and gospel on the radio should be good. Food didn't dissapoint."}
{"text":"The young man who took my order was very polite and has obviously been taught good manners since he called me 'Ms.' Tonia.   Waffles weren't anything to write home to mama about but they were good. Fried chicken was perfect!   We had so much chicken that my daughter and I, ended up taking several pieces home. I popped them in the oven about 5 days later and they were still crispy and delicious.   We will return to patron this business and to get some more of that yummy fried chicken!  We got there right on time because it was a little empty and we had tables to choose from but that didn't last long. It's really small in their but it doesn't stop folks from coming in and ordering themselves some chicken.   They only take cash so come with some paper."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get soul food hands down mouths open.  Got the mix n match to get a taste of everything Catfish, chicken and a side of a waffle, cheesy grits, Mac and cheese and corn bread. Yummy so good. Deff recommend his place to anyone and everyone who enjoys good home style soul food cooking!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint! I had the \"rich boy\" (fried shrimp po boy) sandwich with fries and it was perfect! The shrimp was crispy and flavorful and the sauce they used was so delicious. The bun was soft and buttery and the fries had a nice Cajun seasoning to them. Also tried a piece of my buddy's fried catfish, and it was crispy with a nice cornmeal batter. The service was exceptional and they even give a military discount. This is now my goto spot for authentic soul food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Special hidden gem.  This place has been open since 2008 and has only 15 reviews.  I would have never hit this place up had it not been for a Groupon coupon ($7 for $15 in food)  This is Soul food at its finest.  We had their chicken and waffles which comes with one waffle and 3 whole chicken wings.  I made love to them chicken wings.  I don't leave any meat, skin, or cartilage on the bone.  The bone is sucked dry and rightfully so as it is perfectly seasonsed with the delicious cripsness.  The waffles are similar to Roscoe's in texture but the flavor was really good.  I wish the waffles were a little crisp but they are more of a pancake waffle texture.  In addition to the chicken and waffles, we tried their Grits which were butterty, rich, and went down smoothly with the Chicken and Waffles.  Throw in a side of greens and 2 drinks and w/o the Groupon it was only $21.   Ok I'm not being racist here but you have to judge the food by its loyal customers.  For instance, if you go to a Korean restaurant and see 99% white people, it's probably not good....right?   As we walked into Gritz with all 9 of its tables, we were the only non-AA people there.   To me, that means I hit the jackpot when it comes to soul food.  Sorry....I had to go there....but it's true.  At least I'll say it :)  The owners were super nice and chatted with us about the food.  We told them we'll be back and for good reason.  Cheap, delicious, home comfort food at its finest.  Considering how much love M&M gets, Grifz Cafe should as well.  Be sure to check them out!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's very cozy if you like intimate settings but if your claustrophobic you maybe want to just get your food to go. The food is amazing the customer service was great the reason for my 4 stars is because it took forever for our food to come but the only reason it took forever was because the food was freshly cooked. When I'm in town again I would love to go back :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are from out of town, but we would recommend this place hands down! We samples many items and were satisfied with everything: chicken, grits, waffles, yams, peach cobbler, fish, eggs... YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best from the rest  f the rest in the wicked west lol No hands down I'm  addict every Sat or Sunday I have to get my fixed The food is so delicious the yams are crazy good the whole entire menu is delicious I tried it all good work guys  The girls upfront are so nice and so pretty and the chefs in the back are a work piece and nice as well I love it keep feeding Me ;)"}
{"text":"My food was so good,  it is off the strip but it is worth it.  The chicken was seasoned really well. The Grits were so creamy and tender.  My girlfriend got the fried catfish and we were swapping out bites.  This place is worth every bite"}
{"text":"This is not a full blown soul food restaurant because the \"soul food\" selections are very limited.  In addition to a small collection of southern cooking you can choose from an assortment of po-boys and breakfast items.  This place is small and the service is nothing special."}
{"text":"Best Soul food in The Valley!!! I had the fried chicken  n Catfish With homefries n sweet potatoes  Everything was Tha Bomb.Com!!! Seasoned to Perfection!!! Definitely will be Back!!!"}
{"text":"I am so ashamed that I have known about this spot am just getting around to trying it out. Even though it has good reviews... I was still skeptical. I'm really picky when it comes to soul food. Man, this place did NOT disappoint.   It's a very casual joint and your food is served on plastic plates with plastic utensils. The staff was polite and very attentive.   I ordered chicken and waffles and a side of cheese grits. My friend ordered the mix and match which included two wings, two pieces of catfish, and eggs and instead of toast a waffle.   This mess was beyond delicious. The chicken and waffles came with FOUR CHICKEN WINGS. FOUR!!!! Four chicken wings and a waffle for 12 bucks. These chicken wings weren't rinky dinky either. The flavor was sooo good. The waffle was just okay. There's nothing like a Roscoe's waffle. I nibbled on my friends catfish and it was so good. Reminded me of my grandmas.  Now, you can't go to a restaurant named GRITZ and not try the grits. They were delicious! The perfect smooth consistency, no lumps no grains...just cream buttery goodness. I had cheddar cheese added to my grits and I thought I was gonna explode from eating too much goodness. Well I go back? Damn right. **drops mic** lol"}
{"text":"I decided to eat here while on vacation as suggested by my sister who ate here on her vacation prior. I went with a party of 4 around noon on a weekday. The size of the place is very deceiving and the place was packed the entire time I waited inside. It's extremely small with a limited amount of tables to eat-in. My party ordered dinners that consisted of catfish, chicken wings, greens, grits bowl, yams, cornbread, and waffles. We had other sides but, forgot what they were. However, I really wanted to love this place but, wasn't overly impressed as I hoped to be. We were standing waiting for our food for well over an hour and eventually, was forced to eat in our car because of no seating and was also, a wait on tables. As for the food, it was pretty average. My daughter hated the yams and said they tasted weird and wasn't sweet. The chicken was alright but, I preferred another area soulfood place in the area a little better that I visit when I'm in town. My hubby loved the grits bowl with eggs. He said the waffle was average and probably would've been better if he'd have eaten it hot inside instead of a container that made it soft after a few minutes. Both my daughter and he too, agreed that the other soulfood place had better tasting chicken wings. I personally, liked their greens but, they needed a little salt to my liking so, I added some. My daughter enjoyed her catfish but, I thought it needed a little salt too. The cornbread was average, and not bad. We were given complimentary soft drinks, and lemon cake slices because we waited so long which, was cool. I may come back for a takeout order in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent grits! I can't wait to go back even though it's out of the way. I took a friend and she really liked it too.  PROS: Grits - creamy, thick and smooth              Grits bowl with bacon and cheese  CONS: Small dining area/possible wait on weekends"}
{"text":"I was Greeted with a warm friendly smile  Service was great. I had wings, waffle, scrambled eggs with cheese and gritz. Very tasty, more food than I could handle for a decent price!!"}
{"text":"Wow this food was very tasty and filling!  The location is kind of small inside, not too much seating. There is a sign up front that says they charge $0.50 for using credit or debit card.  I got The Louisiana:  juicy hot links served with 2 sides, and bread (toast, English muffin, or biscuit).  I chose to get Macaroni & Cheese, Greens, and Cornbread, and a Sweet tea.  The sausage was really, really good. It's either the way they cooked them, or the sausages themselves, but they tasted like they were cooked over a wood grill or something. They were really, really delicious, and I would get them again. The cornbread was really good too. Out of the sides, the macaroni and cheese was ok, the cheese sauce was a little watery but the noodles were al dente which I like.  The greens were really good, with ham, kind of salty but I think supposed to be.  My husband got the Big Gritz Breakfast: Chicken or Fish, two eggs, grits and waffle. He chose the fried Chicken, and added Bacon, Onion and Cheese to his grits.  The eggs were cooked Over-medium.   The chicken was nicely fried, and there was a large portion. The waffle was good, a little on the thin side (not super fluffly) but tasted pretty good.   The gritz were really good and tasty, especially putting the egg in and mixing it around. The yolk was runny enough so the eggs were really cooked perfectly.    Overall we really enjoyed our food and the sweet tea.  I didn't feel too healthy after eating all this food but it was definitely delicious and enjoyable. Everyone was really nice and constantly asked if we needed anything.    The 2-seater round tables were kind of tiny, and we didn't have too much room for the utensils, plates of food, tray of sauces, and napkins, and drinks. The sweet tea is refillable and the ladies working there kept asking if we needed a refill which was nice!"}
{"text":"My girl found this amazing soul food cafe during our trip to Vegas. The food is amazing, I enjoyed the Mississippi (catfish and grits)!   Great food and great hospitality from the staff."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING !!!! I was going to drive to roscoes but my brother told me about this place ! Service was absolutely amazing!! SEE YOU SOON!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars!  I have had ok food there before, but it is hit or miss. When they first opened it was alright, there service was usually on the below average side...  I just went there yesterday and ordered two catfish and grits plates.  Eggs - cooked the wrong way, lukewaRM, and forgot my cheese Toast - no butter, cold and the wrong kind Catfish- dry grits- ok  The service SUCKS! I called and spoke with the manager and she told me she would comp me one breakfast this morning, although parts of both catfish plates were wrong, I found that to be acceptable   I called this morning and they tell me too bad that person no longer works there, then they hang up on me  Dont go there, Marios right on MLK and Lake Mead has great catfish and mac and cheese, although they dont have grits :("}
{"text":"I had heard all of the hype , but had never been. Now I can't wait to go back. The grits are the best around. Thick, hearty and full of flavor. My only regret was not getting them smothered with bacon and cheese. I would rate the chicken fried steak in the top three valley wide. Tender with a tasty breading and enough country gravy to go around. The eggs were just okay, as was the coffee. The staff was friendly and the place was spotless. Definitely a good spot for breakfast with a return trip in the near future."}
{"text":"I like little hole in the wall type of places... This one just happens to offer a Good hearty breakfast as well..( I was looking for the Grits).... Not the easiest place to find but in the end it was worth in the food and that is what its all about..."}
{"text":"STILL my favorite fried chicken in Las Vegas. Crispy yet tender whole wings seasoned perfectly. Pork chop so tender and flavorful. Hot link got a nice bite to it, heat that hits the middle of the tongue not the back of the throat. You can't miss with the grits. And the mac and cheese is a MUST DO. A little pricey with the sides being $3 for the amount u get but the taste makes it worth it. Everyone is super nice. Seating is very limited tho as this place gets packed fast."}
{"text":"Had a great food experience. I ordered the mix and match which came with two pieces of chicken two pieces of catfish greens macaroni and cheese and I also ordered a side of grits with shrimp it's a nice cozy small place to eat. Customer service was nice I didn't get a chance to get the lady's name that took our order but she was very helpful.I would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"This not my first time here and I really love this place.My friend got the chicken & waffles & they are bomb. I got the bubba (cheeseburger & fries). It so good & taste homemade. Trust me I will go again"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time.  I love supporting local businesses especially those that serve Soul food!  I ordered the Catfish, grits with cheese, scrambled eggs, and sweet potato pancake.  I must say, this place is a Gem!  The staff are professional, the place was clean, and the service was fast!  I will definitely be back!  Thank you Mrs. Trina for blessing Vegas with a place to get a real meal!"}
{"text":"The greatest and first Cobb Omelette I've ever had.  Good hotcakes too!! (place needs to expand -too small) lol"}
{"text":"First time here at this place and I really  the food I had a turkey bacon egg white omelette and some home potatoes that was and on top of that all the waitresses did excellent with there service"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the restaurant. The service was so welcoming I felt as though I've been coming for years. I tried their grits, pork chops, biscuit, and chicken wings, and they were all tasty. In definitely making another trip in the near future."}
{"text":"can never complain about this place. absolutely amazing food. i'm from arkansas & this place reminds me of home. A bit pricey, but definitely worth your money."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise Hands down the best service and southern food in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Whenever me and the family goes to Las Vegas we make sure we eat at Gritz Cafe some of the best soul food Gritz on hit"}
{"text":"First time there. There was no menu hanging but up by the cash register. Ordered chicken and waffles to share with my friend and catfish combo. the catfish wasn't so oily and the chicken and waffles was amazing.  there was only 2 people working up front, a young gentleman and a lady. they were both great and i will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"OMG I'm so happy I can here!  I almost went to Lo Lo's chicken & waffle but they didn't open till 9 so I came here instead and honest the BEST decision!  The customer service was great greeted friendly as soon as I walked in. The food is made to order so it's definitely fresh.   The chicken and waffles is a must!  The give you 4 huge wings which I love because most places give you 3 small little wings!  I will be sure to come back and tell family and friends!"}
{"text":"I've been to the gritz cafe for years and never have I waited 45 minutes to an hour for a #3 Kentucky , 15 minutes of that was standing in line waiting to order standing up! ! I don't care how much traffic your having! It's time to either invest in a larger property with more cooks, drive thru and more waitresses , or deliver through uber or lyft because that's was a damn shame . I suffer from ptsd and you guys worked on my last nerve!"}
{"text":"Very clean and they are very nice.food is good and flavorful.nice little atmosphere but can get very crowded on morning and weekends."}
{"text":"Wow! When you combine great food with excellent customer service you can name it Gritz Cafe! Breakfast for me was 4 fried wings breakfast potatoes scrambled eggs & cornbread- delicious  The potatoes remind me of my grandma's. The owner and her staff are warm and efficient. The place is small so be prepared for a possible wait but it's definitely worth!"}
{"text":"Our friends have been raving about this place!  They serve B-fast til 3:00 p.m. There only open until 3:00 p.m. too! When you get there, you just go up to the counter and order your food, and find a table.  I order chicken and waffles,   Hubby ordered pork chops with grits and eggs.  Our order cam fast!  I saw my wings, and WOW!  I didn't expect 4 wings!  And they were freaking good!  and the waffle was amazing too!  hummmm, my husband's pork chops was as thin as 3 pieces of paper put together, so he was complaing!  I have no idea what he's talking about, cause mine was the bomb!  I wasn't even trying to hear what he was talking about!  After about the 3rd piece of chicken, he asked to try a piece of my chicken!  and he really liked it!  He said he was glad he tasted mine, because it left a good taste in his mouth.  Usually, I get what he gets, and I'm glad I wasn't in a pork chop mood!  I hope to be back soon!  this place is soooooooo good!"}
{"text":"My first time going to grits cafe the food was great....... I would've given it 5 but the restaurant is too small, all the people there are really nice and friendly I had the mix and match with a tall glass of muddy water.   Ps I will return"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here while visiting Vegas. I must say the food was very good. I would recommend everyone  to come here, when you visit. It was hard finding this place but it was worth it. I had the pork chop, with mac&cheese, greens very good!"}
{"text":"Wifey received a tip from a co-worker on this place, so we thought of giving this place a try instead of stopping at Mario's for our Catfish/Turkey Neck fix which is close by.  This is a really tight spot filled with two and four tops, so coming here with five or more people will probably end up in a longer wait than usual. We split the Big Breakfast of Chicken(or your choice of Fried Catfish) and Waffles, two eggs, and grits(first grits topping is free) and we also split The Rich Boy(AKA Shrimp Po' Boy) which came with 8 crisp, juicy shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and their special sauce on a toasted hoagie roll.  The chicken was good(all chicken wings) but I still like the fried chicken from Kathy's and the waffle was so-so. I have yet to find a good place in Vegas that has solid chicken and waffles(still have to try Skinnyfats' version) but the Rich Boy was very delicious and I'd return for that sandwich again.   Give Gritz Café a go, and see if its good enough to slap yo' momma!    ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"On my first visit I was hooked, I consider myself a very good cook, and I am picky about my Grits........I was not disappointed with the grits, they were cream and seasoned just right.  The chicken wings were cooked to perfection!...Hubby had the Catfish and he has told everyone how good it was.  On our second trip I had the Grit bowl and it too was delicious.  I'm going for number three as soon as I hit Vegas in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"After a night of drinking in Las Vegas this gets my right every time... I get shrimp n grits half fried half grilled... Shrimp are big  and food is bomb grits just right..."}
{"text":"Awesome service with a Smile. Delicious chicken & Waffles, & Grits! I love this place already! Best $12 for food Ive spent in a Long Time!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had waffles, chicken wings and potatoes DELICIOUS....All my Dad kept saying in Damn is this good lol....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"Food is great, but this place is entirely too small for the amount of business that they do. Always too crowded with people standing around waiting to sit to eat over people who are sitting eating. Would love to see them expand or find a new location."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, I was apprehensive about trying the catfish since I'm not typically a fish person but fry up that sucker and put some hot sauce and whoa nelly, maybe I'll have to eat fish more often.  It made me disappointed though that I played it safe and only ordered one piece of catfish with a piece of fried chicken.  I wasn't a big fan of the chicken and just felt the need to pour more and more hot sauce on it to make up for it.  I didn't play it safe on the side though and decided to try out the grits.  Problem was I had no idea what to do with them.  I tried to make them sweet with sugar packets and jelly but it just wasn't working.  I might to do more research on what to do with grits or just be lazy and just order the potatoes on the side if I ever do come back here.  So in the end my feelings on this place were mixed, I wouldn't argue if friend suggest to eat there, but I won't champion for it either.  Then again I might need to eat some more catfish in the future."}
{"text":"I don't know where all of the five stars come from. I would have said 2 stars but who I was with really liked their meal.   The quality of the food is good but the prices on breakfast are very high when compared to others in the Lad Vegas area. 10.50 for biscuits and gravy, it does come with two eggs which were good but I didn't want I just wanted good biscuits and gravy.  Now I did try some of the waffle that who I was dining with and it was VERY good. I don't know if it is better at lunch but may try it I will not try breakfast again here."}
{"text":"service: great  food: grrrreat (omg the potatoes, catfish && the chicken) wish i can have some now mmhhhhh  its a small place but sooooooo worth it!!!!!!  loves it!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd have to give this establishment 5 stars ! My family decided to try a new place on Saturday morning , we chose Gritz Cafe and I'm glad we did ! My daughter , my fiancé and myself walked in , placed our orders and were able to find a seat just in the nick of time ! There's not much seating inside , but this isn't a bad thing , especially if you're okay with waiting around for a few mins for a current party to finish up and leave . A lot of people ignored the sign up front that clearly says \"place your order BEFORE being seated\" but it's okay .  The food was amazing . I ordered the mix and match meal for about $11.50 . I chose catfish and hot link as my meat , Mac and cheese and yams as my sides and cornbread as my bread . Oh man . Definitely the best soul food I've had since moving here to Las Vegas about 4 years ago . The portions were amazing , the catfish was FRESH and fried perfectly , not hard ! The sides were fresh and so tasty ! This place isn't close to home but I'll be stopping in EVERY chance I get . Thank you for the wonderful service !"}
{"text":"GREAT CONCEPT. AVERAGE EXECUTION.  * A palace called GRITZ should have better ones. Or, at least, more options of them ( like-regular, cheese polenta, w/red eye gravy, etc) not just the option of \"toppings\" * Potatoes are good * Everything fresh and cooked to order * Nice cozy inside * Good service * Price a little high for what you get - lower the price and its fine. Or, keep the cost the same but raise the level of execution. A place called Gritz, located in the \"Hood\", priced pointed high, should have some more soul to its food...more \"stank\" on it. But all in all Ive had worse. Ive been to this type of place all over the US...heck Ive been to this place before. I respect the effort  and would return."}
{"text":"What a great find! It is not in a place you would normally expect to find a great restaurant. Warning, if you are wanted by the FBI, don't go here. It is right across the street from the local FBI office.  This is a pretty small restaurant and I'm told that the line is usually through the front door. Fortunately I beat the crowd on the day I went. It did start filling up after I finished.  The staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. I had the two pieces of chicken & waffles with a side of grits. It was plenty of food and really satisfying.   At some places, it really seems like the staff is there for a paycheck. Here, the people really seem to enjoy their work environment and are glad you're there. They came by to refill drinks and see if we needed anything else. It was a Southwest Airlines experience."}
{"text":"Gritz, cheese,  and jalepenos! It was soooo yummmy! We ordered it to go, but I look forward to dining here for a good southern meal."}
{"text":"My friends and I were searching for a soul food place and were told to go here by a Vegas native. Was not expecting this place to be as good as it was and it caught all of us by surprise. It is way north of the strip, but so worth the drive. Gritz Café is located on a small street off of MLK road in a business park/strip mall.   As we walked in we noticed the place was very small (about 10 tables) and it smelled like Heaven. The staff greeted us right away, gave us menus, and told us to take our time ordering. We felt right at home when we walked in the door as the staff reminded us of our family members and their good home cooking. It was great to see the variety of main and side item choices on the menu. I selected the Louisiana, which was a hot link plate and a side of grits with bacon bits (first toping is free) and greens; and a piece of cornbread. My friends order fried chicken, fried catfish, waffles, mac n' cheese, greens, and eggs.   Our food was brought out one by one by a wonderful server who was very attentive and sweet. The food was very hot, fresh, and flavorful. The hot links had just the right amount of spice, the grits(z) were smooth and creamy, and the greens were seasoned just right that I did not even need any hot sauce! (smile) All of us shared our food, so I got a chance to try the mac n' cheese and waffles that were just as flavorful and wonderful. We spent the entire meal talking about how awesome the food was and how we want to come back the next time we were in Vegas. The only thing missing in the restaurant was some cots as we all needed a nap afterwards. (smile)  It is hard to find good soul food in Phoenix, so each time I go to Vegas Gritz will be on my list of restaurants to eat at! So worth the drive for the awesome food and service!!"}
{"text":"I had the catfish with eggs and a waffle. A very savory and delicious combination. This is by far some of the best fish I ever ate. The eggs and waffle where delicious also...   Great customer service definitely five stars in my book. I will be having brunch here on my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very nice people here. I would come back just because of how nice they treated us. One employee was going home and on her way out she put her bag down just to grab our plates to throw them out!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend said \"I'm craving grits\". Found this place on Yelp and we are SO GLAD to have found it. It's small so get there early. Any grits bowl is delicious! Corn bread crumbly and warm mmmm. Biscuit was warm inside- add butter- omg.  Great service. We didn't have to ask for refills or bus our table. They were on it!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried chicken, catfish and creamy grits. Small place and popular. Be prepared to wait or take to go. Worth the drive a couple miles past downtown."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this is one of my favorite places in Vegas!!!!!! Get here early because there will be a wait. I'm a grits fanatic and they make the best. It's not mushy or too creamy. I always get the #3 which comes with 4 whole wings, 2 sides and a carb. The staff are always friendly no matter how busy they are. Please try the catfish too you will not be disappointed! If you like your food bland, do not come here. They season everything and it's always great!!!!"}
{"text":"We loved the generous portion of grits. No lumps! Just creamy and perfectly seasoned. Also enjoyed the well-seasoned generous serving (4!) of whole chicken wings that were fried to perfection. Our waffles, while not as crispy as we'd like, were also just fine. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because they use plastic place settings and plastic(?) plates."}
{"text":"My gf and I were looking for southern cooking and found this gem on the south side of Vegas. The staff was friendly and the catfish, grits and chicken and waffles were oh sooo delicious.  We highly recommend this place away from the strip."}
{"text":"Introduced by a great friend. Variety of choices, chicken & waffles, fried catfish, to basic eggs and bacon. It's great food! The services is great!  My mom is picky with her coffee and she said it was the best!"}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits were good!!!! Wings were excellent tastes BETTER than Roscoe's...."}
{"text":"You have got to try Gritz Cafe when you visit Las Vegas. This is one of the best places to dine for breakfast, lunch, or dinner any day. We truly enjoy coming here with family and friends. The southern fried steak and gravy, grits with cheese, and eggs are simply delicious. The new sweet potato waffle with melt your pallet in your mouth. If former President Obama and FLOTUS Michelle diner here, then you definitely need to try it as well"}
{"text":"I got gritz they were okay but then again I've never been a big fan.  The catfish on point!! My chicken and shrimp salad was AMAZING!! they are friendly i took off 2 stars because one of the workers kept coming over and staring and asking if everything is okay but the way she was staring came off creepy.  I'll be back for catfish and salad as gritz aren't my cup of tea still"}
{"text":"Really...?! I've been here twice and I can't really say any of the food knocked my socks off. I've ordered the grits bowl and po-boy with catfish. Grits bowl is pretty straight forward grits, sausage, eggs, and cheese. I've only had plain homemade grits grits in the past and this dish didn't exactly impress me. I wanted to give them a second chance since all their reviews are pretty good on Yelp, plus my co-workers talk about how good the sandwiches are. My second visit I order the po-boy with catfish which good, but it was a small considering the price is $8.50. It had lettuce, tomato and some type of sauce, the sauce added the extra pazaze to it. The size should of been bigger or at least add more catfish in there. I think the prices here are $2 or $3 more than what they really should be. This is the closest restaurant to my work, but I probably won't be back. The chicken and waffles looks good, if I'm really craving it, I might be back for that, but once again they are overpriced because it's $10.95, really?! $11 for chicken and waffles, that's pretty expensive considering how cheap it is to make a waffle and they use chicken wings, not even the better parts of the chicken."}
{"text":"Whole in the wall restaurant. I ordered the fried chicken wings and waffle. The fried chicken was really good, juicy and crispy! The waffles are probably the best waffles I've had so far, moist and CRISPY! I've never had crispy waffles before, soooo good! This place is very small and packed but there's also outdoor seating and plenty of parking.   You line up to order, once you pay you then find seating and the server will bring you the food."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  The grits are perfectly cooked.  The plates are huge!  We had chicken and catfish, waffles and potatoes and biscuits.  The staff was really sweet helpful and accommodating.  If and whenever you're in Vegas the Gritz Cafe is definitely worth the trip.  Breakfast is the best."}
{"text":"I just wanted to let the people know that the Gritz Cafe is the boom, my favorite is the Mississippi , I'm from Compton, Ca and I've been there 4 times the only place I will go to eat breakfast  when I'm in Las Vegas, NV. And it is black owned I love supporting my people, only one advice when you serve coffee it could be in a coffee cup and milk should  be serve in a glass, that was my dad's only gripe!  Diana Holmes-Peters!"}
{"text":"I go to Gritz as often as I can. The only problem is its on the westside of town and I'm in Henderson. My wife loves the chicken and waffles. The grits themselves are amazing, creamy and flavorful. The sausage and catfish are also great. I always order too much food because I cant pick just one. The menu is limited to breakfast food and baskets and sandwiches for lunch. Still one of my favs"}
{"text":"I cant believe I never commented  on this place. Been here I think lile 3 times, when i go to Vegas. The food is so bomb! I Love there grits and everything pretty much. The service is so good I will deff be back here, any chance im in Vegas I deff will try to stop here."}
{"text":"Amazing southern food for a great price I had the rich boy tomatoes and sauce and shrimp and bread was amazing ! Will definatley bed stopping for the big Fritz breakfast chicken and waffles all the way !"}
{"text":"I love Gritz.. I really do! Its small and feels intimate in only a way a mom and pop restaurant feels. The staff are hit or miss. Sometimes they visit the table more times than you actually care to see them.. and other times you have to ask them to the table. Not a complaint, just an observation.  My only issue with Gritz... is the paper plates and plastic silverware.  I understand the business is small and probably doesn't have a complete full kitchen to manage washing multiple plates ect.. but it feels cheap.. and while the food is reasonable it is not cheap.. if that makes sense.  the food itself is always good, I have never come here and not been satisfied. The chicken.. flavorful, the grits.. creamy, the fish... piping hot...  I look forwarding to seeing Gritz possibly expand and being more of a force in the valley. I think they have the potential."}
{"text":"This place was great I enjoyed my food and the customer service was great.  I ordered the big breakfast and switched the eggs for Mac and cheese. So I had a waffle chicken grits and Mac and cheese.  I liked it all and for the price it was great. The restaurant was small and loud but that was not a problem for me."}
{"text":"Great hospitality, awesome food--fresh, hot, and delicious! Perfect morning stop! Loved the climate!"}
{"text":"The food here was AMAZING! My girlfriend and I were vacationing at the Hard Rock we wanted to get some really good breakfast and for whatever reason I woke up wanting Chicken and Waffles. We googled a few places and this place had the most amount of stars and wasn't that far away from the hotel. The pictures online weren't bad neither.  Entering the restaurant I almost about faced because it was so small and reminded me of the hood restaurants in Brooklyn. Idk if me and my GF looked like tourists or what so I didn't really want to chance it. Lol  However I was quickly greeted by friends faces and warm smiles. I felt immediately comfortable and relaxed. It didn't take long for our food to come but everyone made sure we were ok multiple times while we waited.  Even the owner of the place was pleasant. We loved that place so much we even tipped $5! Now idk if that's a lot in Vegas but in NY you have to really be doing something for me to up a $5 tip. Lol  Great job guys! If you're visiting Vegas you HAVE TO stop by this place! It's a must!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and it was a horrible experience. We were handed a menu upon sitting down, after about 8 mins of sitting we were asked if we ready to order and we said yes and she did reply back saying \"OK\". Mind you we went offered anything drink prior or after her asking if we were ready. So we sat for another 5 min and she still haven't came back to take our order. If you don't already know this place is a very small dining, when I say small, I mean you can have a conversation from one side of the dining area to the other with a normal tone and hear everyone's conversation as if you are sitting at their table. Anyhow, the waitress/server turns around and goes past us to sit at another table and started rolling utensils. At this point I was fed up with service. So we just got up and excused ourselves out with a \"Thank You Have a great day!!\" I don't care how good the food has been said to be... but we will definitely not EVER be going back"}
{"text":"I stopped in here this morning because I love grits.  Usually I just have grits as a side when I'm at Denny's or get a small bowl at Red Rock's buffet but this is the real thing.  I got a grits bowl.  I chose the three slices of bacon and I got cheddar cheese on the top.  I asked for the egg sunny side up.  It also came with a choice of toast or biscuit and I got whole wheat toast.    I left the counter carrying my coffee cup and within a relatively short time, a young woman brought my breakfast to me.  Wow, was it good!  Break the yolk, and let it run into the grits along with the butter I had already put in.  Wonderful.  The restaurant is small--nine tables.  There was a couple with two small children at the other table--I hit a quiet morning--and they were visiting from California.  That's the kind of homey atmosphere the place has.  Adam, the young man taking orders today, was a very pleasant guy!   This is stick to your ribs down home cooking.  What that means is that breakfast was heavy laden with carbs so I'll have to do extra at my gym workout this afternoon.  Oh the horror, but it was so worth it.  Thanks to Sylvia and Nelson Q. for their heads up on this great place."}
{"text":"I have been here twice while in Vegas and have not been disappointed. I always get the grits bowl with the catfish. The fish is always  cooked perfectly and hot! The eggs were scrambled well and the service is good. I feel safe in the neighborhood due to the restaurant being located by the Metro police headquarters and the FBI building.   It is great going out of town and seeing a black owned restaurant, with good food and great service! Thank you so much and I wish you prosperity to remain a successful business that will expand :)!"}
{"text":"My wife found this hidden gem from reading all the good reviews from fellow Yelpers. So thank you!! Have been looking for a good southern food establishment. This restaurant fits the bill.  Took my Dad here a couple of weeks ago for his birthday breakfast. Located in West Las Vegas on Stella Lake just west of MLK. It's located in a small building right next to the police substation. Located in a nice new building, it is quite small inside, maybe 6 tables, mostly 2 tops and a couple larger 4 top tables. No problem. As good as the food was i would of sat on the floor or out on the grass to eat.   First of all this place smells amazing. I knew we were in for a treat. Finally found food just as good as when I lived in Mississippi. My Dad ordered the mix and match. you pick 2 meats, 2 sides and choice of bread. He chose the chicken wings, catfish, along with grits, potatoes, and toast. Just a shout out to the Catfish. It was hot, moist, delicious flavor and one of the best crusted coating batters i have ever had. Southerners everywhere would be proud. Grits were creamy and cooked perfect. Awesome all the way around.  I ordered the chicken and waffles. Really was looking forward to trying this, and I was not dissapointed. You get 4 large chicken wings. They were seasoned perfectly, and piping hot. So hot in fact it stayed that was the entire meal. It just would'nt cool down. lol. The waffle was delicious, light and fluffy. Pour the maple syrup on everything and it was southern hospitality on a plate. Really Really Good!!  Breakfast is served all day. A lot of the plates are named after southern states. Such as the Arkansas. Country Chicken fried steak and gravy. The Virginia. Grilled ham steak. All plates are served with 2 eggs, grits or potatoes and bread, muffin or biscuit.  Overall a great place to get your Southern Fix on. Friendly service, great Southern food, large portions, and good prices. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Came to Gritz Cafe for the first time this morning after an appointment in the area. I like the vibe of this place. Everyone was welcoming and friendly, the place was cozy, the bathroom's super clean too.  We ordered Louisiana links and eggs for my date and chicken and waffles for me. They ran out of full wings so they offered me party wings instead. While we were finishing up our order I noticed the catfish and waffles that was waiting to be served which looked yummy so I asked if I can have half wings and half catfish instead. The cashier said they normally don't' do it but she was super nice and let me have it instead. When our food was served, I was given a full order of wings instead and I mentioned the mistake. Told them not to worry about it and I'll just eat what I had(which was a lot) but they insisted to give the catfish too. That's what I call good service.  Anyway, our food was piping hot. Hubby loved his links and eggs. The links were juicy and flavorful. I wasn't able to get a picture because he wolfed it all down. My party wings were crunchy in the outside and juicy in the inside. They complimented the waffles really well. The catfish was good too but I preferred the wings. I liked their hot sauce too. Not too spicy, just right.   With 5 star service and very good, affordable food, we will be back. Looking forward to trying their shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in Vegas. I've been almost every weekend since I found the place. Order the Louisiana special with grits and a buscuit. location is awkward and the food is a little pricey ($21 for two) but well worth it. Service is super friendly and never a complaint. Love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I Love Me Some Gritz!!  Quick Review:  I've had Gritz Café bookmarked for over 2 years and finally checked them off my list.  I recommend that you head out here if you're craving a mean bowl of grits and an even meaner Chicken & Waffles.  Gritz Café does it right.  Gritz Café does it good.     The Food: I had their Big Gritz Breakfast.  This meal consisted of their 5 pieces of fried chicken, waffles, 2 eggs, and a cup of grits.  Cost is about $15 and you get a lot. The grits was thick and creamy, which is exactly how I prefer it.  As for the chicken & waffles, it was delicious.  The fried chicken wings is perfectly seasoned and breaded.   The Service: 5 Stars for their service. Emma was awesome.  She made sure that we were comfortable and even moved us to another table with more room.   The Establishment: The restaurant is small, and it's busy. Tables are also first come, first serve.  My suggestion is to come early or call in your order.  There's also seating outside and It's called the sidewalk.     Tips:   -The food comes out hot.  Take your time or you'll burn your mouth.  -Located off Lake Mead and MLK.    2016 Yelp Review #13"}
{"text":"I loved the concept of paying first. The wait was not long. Waitresses were very friendly. The food was very good. Came fresh. It's small but busy. A hidden gem for travelers. I would recommend this spot. Went a second time. Clean bathroom. Fish, chicken, country fried steak with grits and sweet potato fries. Excellent."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here and it's good to support to mom & pop restaurants. Definitely recommend Gritz cafe. Normally get the chicken and waffles with a side of cheesy scrambled eggs. I tried some of my friend's hot link which was also great."}
{"text":"Catfish perfectly crisp; no fish fry here just the perfect anount of seasoning fried just the way my momma makes with corn meal.  Yams just sweet enough. Service impeccable.  Menu a bit confusing, I couldve sworn the Mississippi came with grits but In so stuffed who has room to complain.  Drink was refilled and I was checked on 2 or 3 times.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is warm, inviting, and it has excellent service. When I arrived they were extremely busy and crowded but the beautiful and amazing waitresses reassured me I would have s place to sit. once my food was ready. They were right and everyone was seated in a timely fashion. Due to our wait which wasn't that long twe were given a free appetizer- fried grit balls with cheese amazing! The food was excellent. I will be back and I highly recommend them..."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo good. Still feel full and my soul feels good after eating here. We took an Uber from our hotel to Gritz. Excellent friendly service, down home vibe, and the food was AMAZING. Freshly fried chicken wings and fish. The grits and potatoes were on point. Even the English muffin was delicious. My boyfriend was also impressed and got a homemade rice crispy treat to go. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I really like their food. The only thing not so good about this place is limited seating. We don't mind ordering for pickup now that we know what kind of setup they have. I've had the catfish and grits breakfast bowl as well as the wings and bacon. The service is good and the staff is friendly. I don't mind giving them business and referring others. I make sure to tell them what to expect as to not be disappointed or have a long wait to get seated, either way it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The lady's greeted me as soon as I walked through the door and we're attentive and explained the menu since it was my first time there. Not sure why others say the customer service is poor. The food was good but not outstanding. I will come back to try the chicken and waffles. I won't go out of my way to go to gritz but if I am in the area a would definitely stop by to grab something to eat."}
{"text":"The food is good here!!! Chicken and waffles is good. That's what i normally have. The only problem with this place is they give you plastic utensils. Cutting a waffle with a plastic knife is really stupid. I'd give them 5 stars if the plastic utensils weren't there. Aside from that the old school r&b is nice when you eating. The place is small so expect a tight ship."}
{"text":"I liked my meal ok and think this place will get another shot. I had biscuits and gravy. I don't like eggs much so I asked for just the biscuits and they didn't charge me for my coffee which I liked. The diner was as clean a looking and smelling establishment as I have ever seen and I'm a chef with 20+ years on the job. The staff were friendly and welcoming and nice. They don't have a wait staff per se you order and pick up from the counter but one of  the ladies brought my plate over. All food is on plastic throwaway flatware etc. My server noticed the portion was light and immediately took it back told the cook to fix it. I like the attentiveness of the server but at 10.50 for biscuits and gravy the cook should have known better since they had just opened and were not busy.. The biscuits were fresh the gravy was tasty but a little cool and again for over 10 bucks 3 biscuits is not outrageous portion vs food cost. I like the food and service overall but for breakfast the lack of traditional waitstaff and plastic ware will take some getting used to but I will come back as its down home cooking close to my house."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was great. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Mix and Match Combo. Hot Link and Fried fish was amazing. Great Service and good food. They were able to accommodate a table of 9 before closing. Definitely returning"}
{"text":"Great place. And yes their Grits are delicious and not too creamy. Fried wings def nice size and portion and fried to perfection. I would say this place is better than Roscoes.  I do wish for $7 the grits bowl came with more than 1 piece of wing.  Service was nice. Place was small gotta get there early if you want a spot to sit."}
{"text":"One word: Yum.  Wow, this place is amazing! I had a catfish po boy and it had this delicious crust on it that gave it the perfect crunch. My boyfriend ordered the gritz and catfish, and the gritz were creamy and buttery and unlike any other gritz I've had, just fantastic!"}
{"text":"This North Carolinian and his Alabama wife wholeheartedly endorse this southern eatery and routinely send people to Gritz for the best grits in Nevada."}
{"text":"I've visited Vegas twice recently and I keep coming back to this place. The food is delicious, chicken wings are juicy and crispy! Customer service is great! Everyone checks on you to see if you need anything else. Can't wait to move to Vegas and be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Cooked to perfection. Had the Mississippi with eggs and collard greens. Portion size was just right. Nice, friendly service too. Will definately stop by when in the area."}
{"text":"My first time! Fabulous!!! I ordered grits with cheese, eggs and turkey sausage. And did have  the cornbread. Delicious!  I WILL BE EATING HERE EVERYTIME I GO TO VEGAS"}
{"text":"Southern hospitality is alive and well in the West. This food will resurrect the dead! This food will make you believe in a God and that there's a devil that created diabetes, hyper-tension, and high blood pressure. To all that, I say, devil be gone! And enjoy this great tasting Southern cuisine.     I'm sorry Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, Brown Sugar in Oakland and all the other soul food places that I have tasted in my life THIS is the best chicken and waffles I have ever had. I'll go a step further, this was the best food that I have eaten in Vegas hands down!   The mac and cheese, grits, potatoes, biscuits and gravy are all top notch! Wow, wow, wow, its the type of food you want to come in hungry for, like have not had a meal in 6 hours type of meal.   Plus, the customer service is stellar and prices reasonable. The only thing is that it is busy! Either get there early or order to go because you may have to wait for a table if you eat inside because of the small dining area. Can't believe this is not 5 stars!!! 5 star cuisine all the way!"}
{"text":"I love chicken and waffles and have tried just about everywhere and I found this on yelp and decided to give it a try because the ratings were good. I'm glad I did. The waffle was thin and crispy like I like it. The chicken wings were huge and crispy and delicious. The service was good considering they were crazy busy. Which is a good thing. It's in a good neighborhood which is more than I can say about other chicken and waffle places in Las Vegas. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"As soon as we got there the place was packed, we didn't realize how small the space was until we step foot in the door. The line was long and after 15 minutes of ordering our food my girlfriends and I finally sat down at the corner table. The table seated up to four but there were only two chairs and better believe we shared those chairs because it took another half hour for us to get our food. By the time we got our food two more chairs became available. I ordered the simplest meal on the menu: Grits, an egg over medium and twelve shrimps half grilled and the other half fried. I explained to our server that I was missing six shrimps. She then said no you only ordered six, she then brings my receipt and it CLEARLY showed I ordered twelve. So by this time I ate half the bowl thinking I'm going to get the rest of my shrimps but nah.. my girlfriend went up to ask for a to go box and about the remaining shrimps and then the cooks or whoever it was starts tripping saying the order was right. I didn't get a refund, apology or my six shrimps but they were quick to mess up my order and keep my money. I can't stand a business that sweats the food YOU already paid for and to top it off we paid 42$ for the Uber ride there and back to the strip."}
{"text":"I had almost given up on finding good grits in Las Vegas! Hallelujah! Great food! I had a grits bowl with bacon, overeasy egg and cheese while my boyfriend enjoyed the chicken and waffles. The grits were warm and creamy, chicken was fried to perfection. One of the best styles of fried chicken I've ever tasted. Pour some hot sauce on and you're golden!  We'll be back again really soon!"}
{"text":"BOMB.com!! Best homecooked breakfast in the valley. Glad to finally have a place that specializes in soul food. Vegas had me worried for a minute. Good staff very nice and helpful. Might have to become my go to spot on weekends!"}
{"text":"Great food , character and plenty of loyalty, only drawback long wait and business has outgrown its current place , a bigger location is needed badly , however enjoy the selections of food which are beautifully prepared"}
{"text":"I didn't get the gritz...  With all the awesome reviews, I was sure this place was going to be amazing... nope!  Upon entering, you have to stand in line and order... there was no line and not one of the employees acknowledged me so there I stood like a moron. I finally asked how I had to order, and the cashier asked me what I wanted. I asked for her suggestions and she told me, the grits.... well.... I don't like grits, and maybe I figured they had more than that! She didn't give me anymore suggestions, so I went with the chicken and waffles.   I waited almost 20 minutes and my food came out, in a to go container.... I told her I was staying to eat. She seemed pissy with me, and thats something I do not like. Don't act like I'm bothering you, this is your establishment and you shouldnt act like a jerk to me! Especially when the table I was sitting at was all sticky and gross. They were sure nice to others, though...  The food was nothing special, the waffle was horrible and bland and the chicken wasnt seasoned. I wished I could've got a refund. I paid $13 for a container of crap.   I will not come here again."}
{"text":"I love everything about it! Food, service, price, music, and black owned! What else can u ask for?!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I'm telling all of my Cali friends and family to stop by when they're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were yummy! I'm not a chicken wing fan so next time, I'll see if they can substitute chicken strips!"}
{"text":"I just can't even explain how good this place is, must try for yourself! The Rich Boy is my favorite! My mom got the bubba, she enjoyed it, now we are back to try the catfish which I am excited I know it will be just as good as what we had before! This is a hidden gem right behind MLK & Lake Mead. I need one closer to me, I travel from Henderson for this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave them another shot. My first experience was underwhelming to say the least. This time the food was very good, and the customer service was excellent. I ordered the chicken and waffle combo with grits. The chicken was seasoned well, and still hot after the drive home. The grits were also delicious.   We were greeted by everyone when we walked in, and were treated very nicely the whole time we were there.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Definitely will be going back. We ordered the catfish plate with yams and mac and cheese, also the bacon and eggs with grits. The only thing I would say is I ordered my egg over medium and it was over hard and its only one egg in the ordered and for sixh a large portion of grits it would've been nice to get 2 eggs."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and invited my mom to check it out with me. We went on a Monday at 1:45PM. They close at 3PM. The place is small so I can't imagine what it's like during their peak hours. We were welcomed by two very polite ladies at the cash register. You order your meal first and then seat yourself. I ordered the Mix n Match which came with 2 chicken wings, 2 pieces of catfish, cheese grits, mac n cheese and cornbread. Wow! Absolutely delicious!!! The food was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The service was amazing. And after I ate my meal, I bought a piece of lemon cake to go which was amazing as well. I'll definitely visit this place again because there's a lot of food on the menu that I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Without a long..... Review. The food was GREAT!!!! Very good, steamy hot when served. I would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for brunch after finding it on Yelp. It's a tiny place, 9 tables in all. Expect to wait so peruse the menu while waiting. I had fried catfish and greens, my partner had wings and waffles with fries, we both had iced tea to drink. The catfish was tender although some pieces were a bit thin. Greens were fantastic, with bits of ham. You could really taste the flavor of the ham cooked in. The wings were great, not greasy, tender and juicy. Service was good even though they were busy.  A couple of reviews mentioned the neighborhood. There's nothing wrong with the neighborhood. It's off a main street (MLK)and in a bit of an office/industrial area, not residential. No reason to feel unsafe at all. I'll hit this place again on when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Our first time here last week.  I'm so happy my husband found this place for me!  I have been complain that there are not many places serve grits anymore, especially breafast or brunch.  The only place I know is Denny's and I'm not too crazy about their grits.  We ordered: Big Gritz Breakfast ($15.50), The Alabama ($9.95), The Mississippi ($10.95), two side of Grits ($3/each).  PROS: Grits - creamy, thick and smooth.  I will ask for no salt, pepper and butter next time.  Hand-breaded fried catfish is the best I've had in a while.  My daughter, husband and I all loved it!!!  We fought over the last piece.  Everyone behind the counter remembered my husband's name when we left.             CONS: Small dining area = wait on weekends, lunch.  Closed at 3p.m. so I can only eat here on the weekend."}
{"text":"My introduction to a PO BOY has happened at last.   Gritz is an unassuming place, located off of MLK, and it happens to be almost directly across the street from the FBI! Yes indeed - there it was, the FBI.  My friend and I trekked here for lunch around 1 PM on a weekday. I was half expecting the place to be packed and we'd have to take our food to go, but I was pleasantly surprised we were able to eat there. It is a small place, with a few tables, and some two-tops along the back wall.   Ordering is done before you seat yourself and then the food is delivered out to you, as well as your fountain drink.  I got the PO BOY - Fried Catfish served on a 6\" grilled hoagie roll with lettuce, tomatoes, and special sauce ($8.50). I am a fan of fried catfish. I have had it fished out of a river, and fried up right before my eyes at many family gatherings in Texas. This fried catfish was wonderful! The crispiness of the fish was perfect, whatever recipe they are using is damn good. The sandwich itself is perfectly portioned with lettuce, cut tomatoes and their special sauce. I also added a good dousing of hot sauce on mine. I was in catfish sandwich (er, PO BOY) HEAVEN.  The restaurant itself is clean and tidy. Service is on point. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Trina and her team are doing an awesome job n making sure your experience is wonderful, and serving da bomb grits (creamy), cat fish and fried chicken!  This was our 2nd time going this year and each time has been a welcomed treat.  We'll b back n April 4 sure and making this our Black Friday tradition going forward!  Thanks Trina!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! The food was hands down one of the best soul food restaurants I have been to in a very long time.  I'm originally from the south so to come to the west coast and find some amazing soul food was so fullfilling. The staff was extremely hospitable. The restaurant itself is a mom and pop establishment so you can tell that the meals are prepared from the heart and with LOVE. Wish I could bring this place back with me to LA. Roscoe's has NOTHING on this place. This place will definitely be my go to spot whenever I come to Vegas!!!! Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"Another great find in Las Vegas. Went here for a quick bite and was happy I did. I had the mix and match with the hot links, wings with Gritz and eggs. All was on point like eating at home (if your wife can cook) it's just good. GO HERE! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Gritz Café on Tuesday morning and it being early on a work day there was not the normal rush. Absolutely no wait (not the norm) but it would be so worth it. I had the Grits bowl with cheese, eggs scrambled, fried catfish, biscuit and with lots of butter. It was pure heaven. Cooked just right, warm and tasty. . Greeted as I walked in the door and checked on several times. Customer service was outstanding (thank you Cee Gee). I will be back and I have to try the chicken and waffles. I also tried the fried grits that they will be offering soon. It was yummy."}
{"text":"It's small inside, yeah. BUT for you whom have complained... You know you can order to go right? Park close by you can eat at. Or you can call and ask how busy they are... Right?  Anyways.... Waffles are so yummy. I barely needed any syrup on them. Chicken is cooked perfectly. It looks like Popeyes Chicken (you know how their chicken always looks perfect) but the flavor is amazing! Each bite I could literally taste all the different seasonings.   Corn bread was too small (only because I'm a fatty Mic Fat Fat) lol  Country fried steak was a-may-zing (only overwatch fans will get that one) I think my only complaint if I had one, would be a little too much gravy. But I can easily take some off.  The staff here make you feel so happy to be in their establishment. They're kind, they constantly check up on you and they are very humble. Thank you Gritts Cafe."}
{"text":"The grits, piece of fish and egg with jalapeños bowl was good. I ordered a side wing as well - a beautiful golden color but I would have loved for it to be cooked just a tad bit harder. It didn't stop me however from enjoying it. My \"partner in crime\" had grilled pork chops, grits and greens. He enjoyed his meal as well. The greens weren't his favorite but I don't always trust his taste buds because he can be picky. I couldn't try them because there were seasoned with meat but looked good. I would definitely recommend this place but suggest a workout after to combat the hight fat content you're sure to get from enjoying such a meal. It comes with the territory, but is highly worth it! Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Best gritz!!! I ordered biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and my boyfriend ordered grits bowl.  I kept stealing his grits!  It was the best I have ever tasted.  Of course, the biscuits and gravy/ scrambled eggs were great too!  Loved it!!   Everyone was very courteous and friendly.  I really love the place and wish that it is on my side of town!  Umm.... I need the grits!!!"}
{"text":"I seriously want to cry as I write this. Now that I'm back from my vacation, I realize that I'm hundreds of miles away......FROM THE BEST GRITS EVER!   I mean you don't need to add salt, pepper or butter. Plus they give you free cheese to sprinkle on top. I seriously had to touch my face to see if I was dreaming. I had the hot links and fried fish that was also amazing.   I am so salty this place isn't in Seattle."}
{"text":"This was without a doubt one of the best restaurants I visited while in Las Vegas! I ordered the catfish grits and potatoes and all of it was fresh hot and delicious. I've often said the little hole in the walls have the best food and this did not change my view. I will definitely return and recommend to any of my friends and family that comes to Vegas. Awesome experience and awesome staff"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here a few weeks ago. It was great! For starters..the restaurant is clean..it may be a bit small, but not overly so. We stopped in around 9 or 10 in the morning and it wasn't crowded at all. No seating issues whatsoever. Just so you know, you order at the counter and someone brings out the food. The ladies that assisted us were very friendly.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I had the grits bowl with catfish and boy was it good! It had been a while since I had a bowl of grits so it was very satisfying. The fish was fresh and delicious. While the piece could have been a bit larger, it was hot and it was well prepared. The bowl had grits and an egg. It was great in it's simplicity. Hind sight, I wish that I had have ordered sausage or bacon because it would have been great adding it to the bowl. The idea of crumbling up the fish and adding it to my grits bowl didn't appeal to me so I ate it on the side as it came.  Since I enjoyed my breakfast so much, I decided to try some dessert because they had one of my favorites on the menu...peach cobbler! I asked the young lady who assisted us to warm it up for me and she did..I enjoyed this peach cobbler. It was a FIRST. Everywhere I've gone and have ordered it, I've been disappointed. Theirs was very good and made with good ingredients. They didn't skimp on the butter and REAL vanilla as these are two key ingredients to a good cobbler.  I like the premise of this restaurant. Grits are way underrated in my opinion. They have more to offer than just grits. I saw someone's plate of chicken and waffles and I almost broke my neck as it was brought to their table..LOL!! The fried chicken looked beautiful...golden brown..I'll definitely try it at some point.  I'll definitely be back...They have a good thing going here."}
{"text":"This is the place I go to for a good southern breakfast if I don't feel like making it at home. Their grits are delicious, their fish is to die for. I love the grits bowls. The food is good and the prices are affordable. I'd get it to go due to the lack of seating space. Other than that, Gritz is a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth chicken and waffles.  Nice staff.  I would give the place 5 stars but it took a little too long to get our food."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the yummy gritz and great service!! I would love to come here for breakfast every Sunday before church:) The large waffle I had was amazing too :)"}
{"text":"I first tried gifts cafe a year ago and it's soooooo good!! It's small but it has a homey feel. I love how all the meals are names after states down south! I just love there food if you are looking for your grandmas breakfast!! This is where it's at."}
{"text":"If you love grits you will LOVE THE FOOD at THE Gritz Cafe! Hostess CG & Emma were so sweet, my husband and I were greeted with a smiling staff, free samples of a new menu item & the best CATFISH, CHICKEN WINGS, EGGS, BISCUITS you could ask for. The grits were creamy & the fish/chicken were seasoned to perfection, yet not salty! We made this our first stop into town & were so pleased...do yourself a favor & stop in for a SLAMMING meal."}
{"text":"The food and the customer service at this place was outstanding. We vacationed in Las Vegas last weekend and I wanted some soul food outside of the strip, so I turned to Yelp and found this place. My daughter and I hopped in our rent a car from our hotel and were on our way. I had chicken and a waffle with a side of grits and my daughter ordered fried chicken, candied yams and Mac and cheese. I'm very critical and particular about my soul food and soul food establishments, but I have to say everything at this place was done well. The food came out very quickly in disposable containers. Everything that we ordered was super good. Everyone that worked there were very nice and pleasant. The only downfall was the place didn't have a lot of seating, but everyone pretty much courteously ate and left and didn't really do too much lounging due to the limited seating."}
{"text":"Gritz was recommended by a relative that moved to the area two years ago. Best recommendation ever!!! Fast, friendly, interactive service with a smile. Ordered Chicken, fish, grits, eggs, and a waffle.  EVERYTHING, even the coffee, was great! Small location, wide range of patrons, excellent customer service and a hello and good bye when you enter and leave. While this was my first visit, it will not be my last!   Our little secret, don't tell anyone!"}
{"text":"The first time I had grits was in basic training.  The first morning of basic training was the first hellish day: we had to eat breakfast together at the same time and in 3 minutes flat.  I thought omelet, toast, links, and a medium glass of orange juice was going be easy, but hell no! So, all morning during our combat timed exercises, I was running on secretly stored fat in  the body to substantiate for energy, oh, and water that TSGT. verbally (every 3 seconds) emphasized water or his spits coming from his fierce mouth as he curses us throughout the long days. The second morning, I quickly scanned the food line and thought to myself, \"....fn, yeah, I need something fast-3 min quick like soup with some texture for my stomach (who makes soup in the mornings?)!...\" Then it hit me, I saw someone in front of me grab a bowl of white sandy pebbles that looked like the cousin of oatmeal: GRITS. It was March 2000 that I was introduced to Grits.  Every morning for about 4 months I'd eat grits bland & snuck a bacon for flavor (thinking I created my own recipe for a moment, what ever works is my modo).    I LOVE grits, therefore, I love this place.  It's located in front of (diagonal like) the FBI building on Lakemead b4 Martin Luther King Blvd.  The place is small to almost medium sized seating area with 9 tables( four of them are 2 people tables, 5 of them are for 4people tables), just get there early or hope once you walk in you see peeps walk out.  I had the Mississippi plate (about 6 strips of well seasoned fried catfish, 2 sunny side eggs, a small bowl of chosen: cheddar & bacon grits, and a moist/flakey biscuit).  Next time, I am just getting the big bowl of grits with catfish, cheddar, & bacon. My Wife had the plate with hot links(tasty) with jalapeño in her grits.  I bought a Groupon: $7 for $15 & just today, Danna bought one (so 4sure, we'll be back).  I saw a lot of people before me order their food \"2go\", smart but I wanted grits fresh & now.  I do not like waiting but if it's food that people at their tables licking their fingers like they're in the comfort of their home, well, why not?  I LOVE grits like a proud moment in time, Thanks, TSGT. De Bose!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a 24 hour work trip... Recommended by my air bnb host, so glad i came for a late lunch before getting on my return flight. Awesome local business, fantastic food, and friendly vibes.  Wanted to try everything so i got the mix and match... wings and catfish with cheese gritz and greens.  The fried catfish was some of the best ive ever had.  worth the trip for the non locals staying on the strip.  If you are a local do yourself a favor and go check them out! I will be back soon... thanks!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Don't need to even say much. This food really was good for the soul. The people working were awesome and the food was incredible. Fried catfish was perfect. The wings are tender and moist inside and crispy outside. Everything was seasoned to perfection. The Mac and cheese was to die for. I can't even stress enough how much you should go try this place. I can't stop smiling!"}
{"text":"The food was okay definitely overrated and served on paper plates. Waiters are disorganized. Took over an hour just to receive a shrimp salad and chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"My dining companion recommended this place...  I was game for some soul food so I figured, 'why not?'    I was looking forward to juicy fried chicken and was disappointed to find out they only served fried chicken wings. I ordered 8 wings and my friend got the catfish po' boy.   Her sandwich came out within 6 minutes but I waited 25 minutes for my meal. After the 20 minute mark I asked one of the workers if my order was coming up soon and she replied with a sarcastic \"no it's not\" and then cackled like that was funny.   When I finally received the wings I realized why it's called \"fowl.\" The chicken was dried and unseasoned. Eating them filled me with a sense of sorrow. I became depressed thinking multiple chickens sacrificed their appendages for this soulless food. I contemplated vegetarianism.   I give this establishment 2 tines on my trademarked five-pronged review fork. I will not return."}
{"text":"It's a little out of the way from where we were staying on Freemont Street but worth the trip if you have the time and a car.   I had the grits bowl with cheese and sausage, my husband had catfish with his grits. I immediately regretted not ordering the catfish for myself after sampling my husband's.  The cornbread was moist and the sweet tea an unusual treat as it isn't common where I live.   Like I said, it's off the beaten path but worth driving a few minutes for."}
{"text":"Best scrambled eggs we've ever had.  My waffles were perfectly crispy and fluffy. The chicken was mouth watering good!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. The fish was tasty but I didn't love the mac and cheese, I'm not a fan of cheese sauce. My opinion nothing special but if I had friends who wanted to come back. I would..."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to have breakfast in Las Vegas!! I ordered the Mississippi.. the catfish was perfection and the grits were the best I've ever tasted.  I sampled my boyfriend's greens and Mac and Cheese, and they were equally as delicious!! And the biscuit... light, fluffy and yummy!!  Each member of the staff was helpful, polite and professional.  They made sure we had everything we needed.   I will be making this my first stop when visiting Vegas from now on!!"}
{"text":"Visited from St. Louis. Great food. I had the catfish and grits. My BFF had the turkey chops. Yes, I typed turkey chops! Everything was so delicious I ordered chicken wings with sweet potatoe fries. The peach cobbler was cool. Small place with big flavor."}
{"text":"I am a Southern Girl; so it's hard to impress me when it comes to amazing food; period! This place is a hidden jewel! The chicken wings and waffles were no disappointment! We are going back today; you know, to make sure their consistent! :-) will try the fish and grits today!"}
{"text":"Loved it. It was delicious. Nice portion, great price. Everything made to order. Grits was perfect definitely satisfied the craving. Greens could be a little better it was a little too bitter for my taste. Wish I lived in Vegas so I can eat there all the time. I would definitely eat there again next time I go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"this restaurant was very good. the service was good. the place is kinda small so get there early. I luv luv luv this place, I eat here every time of go to Vegas and I go often."}
{"text":"Best grits you can find in Vegas. So good, we ordered a second grits bowl to go! The reviews do this place justice and the staff are extremely friendly. Waffles were bomb and so were the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Some of the best soulfood i have ever had. There are many who try but this place nails it! A hidden gem! I will eat here every time i come to vegas!!"}
{"text":"I love to support my local black small businesses. My dad enjoyed the grits bowl with the homemade sausage patty, I WENT went the Mississippi plate.  Fantastic! No need for me to visit family in the ATL and NOLA to get good gritz. Only downside disposable plates and utinsels.  I wish they were a little more eco-friendly.  Super small interior. I counted 9 tables total of 28 chairs so come early if you want to have a seat. Otherwise, absoutely PERFECT if you just want to grab and go.  ENJOY"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food, great service, and great  people running the place. Not hard to find. I live in California, this will be a place I come back to every time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The Cashier Kunta Gave me Great service . He checked on me and my guest several times. He also informed me and my guest that all the food is cooked fresh to order so there will be a small wait when we got our food it was hot and fresh Thanks Kunta we will see you in September."}
{"text":"Best Gritz on this side of the Mississippi!!! Okay let's start with the chicken & waffles 5 stars. Next the crunchy catfish!!! 5 stars & last but not least NY strip steak!!!!! 5 stars   Remember my advice:  Order a large bowl of GRITZ w/ a #4 or #9 or CHICKEN & WAFFLES!!!  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend who lives in Vegas. She gave it rave reviews. I will add a disclaimer that we came on a Saturday & it was a holiday weekend. With that said, the wait was crazy!  Another disclaimer is that they cook to order and I can't be mad at that. The seating was very limited and it's first come, first gets the next open seat....if you're lucky. We had a party of 4 and we lucked out with the outdoor seating as a family was leaving right when our food came out. Otherwise we had planned to eat in the car. The food was very good. We all ordered chicken and waffles & I got a side of grits. The chicken which consisted of 4 whole wings were seasoned well & hot when served. The waffle was ok. Nothing major stood out except it was a full 4 quarter waffle. The service was great. Although there was a line, our order was taken so that it could be worked on while I stood in line to pay. The staff was very friendly & very accommodating when we sat down to eat. They made sure our tables were cleaned off & continued to check on us. And one waiter took a group pic upon our request before we left.  Oh and the grits were cooked just right.  Everyone wanted some after they saw mine, but that would require the need to stand in line again.  No thank you."}
{"text":"Sooo good. I went here last month with my best friend. A great place for southern food on the west. I had their waffle and fried chicken. The chicken was seasoned well."}
{"text":"This food is really really good. They serve REAL DEAL catfish and not swai. They are up on integrity. Don't give you a hard time if you have a legitimate issue. Their fried chicken is also on point.  I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden away in an unsuspecting location, but a great place for breakfast. The staff is very nice and the customers all love being there."}
{"text":"This food is waay over-priced for its quality. The restaurant is small and the short lady with the glasses is very rude.  Me and my family went to eat here and every seat was taken. We decided to take it to-go. At the last minute, about 12 people got up and cleared out. Me and my wife quickly grabbed a seat at the table, even though the table was super dirty with trash. I started to clear the table myself and my wife asked the short lady with the glasses for a wet cloth to clean it. The lady came over and CLEANED EVERY TABLE BUT OURS and didn't even give us a cloth to clean the table ourselves!  This place gets its popularity from locals in the North Vegas area that want something close. It's not worth driving across town for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Mac n cheese was dreamy to the last bite love the service always prompt helpful and such a close knit restaurant every visit."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. I oredered their wing breakfast with potatoes, eggs and a biscuit. It was GOOD!! Decent food, esp. for the price. I paid $8 bucks and it included 3 wings.   Potatoes are the bomb, my chicken was GOOD!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting and I can say the food here is very excellent.  The staff was wonderful and food came in a timely manner.  One thing, glad we missed the rush.  Not very big on the inside but we did dine in.  The menu is very versatile.  I had the #5 and added a waffle.  A few pointers: call to see if there's a wait.  If you want to dine inside call ahead and see if there's a table ready.  You will be much happier than just showing up."}
{"text":"Great Southend comfort food. Staff was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Menu it's simple but so good. Great little place."}
{"text":"First time here. They have the best chicken! it so flavorful and the grits is to die for! We met the owner she is nice. The place is small and they have only 10 tables. Nice and clean place. We have found a new place to go everytime we go to vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome southern style food at very affordable prices. I was a little apprehensive when I saw the location but the service was quick and awesome!"}
{"text":"The Good: The food is GOOD. Period. The catfish - great, the grits - excellent, sausage - off the chain. Waffle: flavor excellent; but mine was cold and a bit hard likely from sitting in a holding-oven, but i'd give it another shot one day. It's in a nicely seculded area and there is a police station next door. Plenty of free parking if you're visiting from the strip; It's not that far of a drive. Prices are great!  The Bad: When you walk in, you are not seated. You will have to stand in line to order first, then seat yourself. I've heard it can be slow, but I think my \"tip\" got our food a bit faster when I ordered :-).  The Ugly: The facility is EXTREMELY small. I would say no more than 12 small tables are in there. So, grab a menu from the front counter, figure out what you want, and if you're dining in, send a drone from your party to grab a table while you're in line. I noticed a lot of people take-out.  Can't wait to go back!  Yelp yourself!"}
{"text":"What a great little hole-in-the-wall place!  And really, it's not a true hole-in-the-wall at all.  It's really clean, and looks fairly new.  But it is off the beaten path.  A small little place with freakin' awesome crew, and the food... oh my god, the waffles!  Second to none in Las Vegas, and that is no exaggeration.  It was a light batter mixture cooked through and through, until it was a dark golden brown, and oh how it soaked up the butter and syrup!  Had chicken fried steak with a breading that was actually crispy, and the gravy was perfect.  Seriously, top notch place!"}
{"text":"Visited Gritz cafe on 4/22/2018. Very unassuming area of town however don't let it fool you. Was immediately greeted with a warm welcome and friendly faces. My husband ordered the Chicken & Waffles and I ordered the Chicken basket. The waffle was decent (just not enough) but the fried Chicken wings were truly on point! Very well seasoned with a nice light and crunchy batter. Will definitely return any time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! If you're looking for a down home country breakfast, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I think the grits were made perfect. We both had grits bowls, mine had bacon and I also requested cheese. The only reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5 was because of the customer service... it didn't seem welcoming to me at all and the small space. Besides that I wouldn't have a problem coming back for to go orders."}
{"text":"Great food.  I had catfish, grits, ?and a waffle?.   My only regret is that I discovered them the last day of my trip.  My waistline is probably happy.  This place is a definite do-over."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday at 2:00 it took them 48 mins to bring out our order. My husband got the fried catfish they were very small portions and it was cold probably cuz they cooked his first and then they cooked my next which took longer. I got chicken fried steak it wasn't that great at all. Their meat tasted like they use low quality meat. We will never come back here again. Too far of a drive and the food nothing great."}
{"text":"The staff was EXTREMELY professional! They were very friendly and accommodating. :)  The food was pretty good, but not \"all that\". The pork chops were flavored nicely but tasted like they were fried in chicken grease, not fresh grease.  The mac 'n' cheese was probably the best tasting thing that I ordered. The greens had a smoky flavor but weren't really seasoned.   Whatever you do, stay AWAY from the cornbread!! It was NOT good. It tasted like uncooked, unseasoned corn meal. Yuck!   The next time I go to Vegas, I don't think I'll be back...."}
{"text":"Must try if your in town. This place is real southern hospitality, we walked in and everyone said hi and welcome to our house! It's all most as good as Ms Tomson's cooking, love you Ms Tomson"}
{"text":"MmMmmM Chicken and Waffles!  I don't order fried chicken often...usually it's just not my dish.  A \"soulless\" piece of dried up, battered bird with no love.  First bite, deep fried grease drippin down your chin...you get the idea.  Thankfully, Gritz Cafe is different...in a GREAT way!  Chicken & Waffles ($10.95). Gotta be some of the BEST fried chicken I've ever had! So much flavor...so juicy...and everything tastes great with Maple syrup poured on it!  Batter has spices and flavor hiding inside, with a nice slightly crispy-crunchy consistency.  Waffle was good, not mind blowing good, but combining it with the chicken takes it up to another level!  Pretty basic waffle, but the chicken is where it's at!  I plan to be back to try the Catfish!  That's actually what I came here for initially, but breakfast moods swayed me!    Too bad they close so early...3pm!  But then again, I don't see myself coming here by myself at 10pm either LOL  Come get some!"}
{"text":"Not the best soul food ever but it will deffinetly do. They make their scrambled eggs exactly how i like em. And their biscuit was on point too. Real big portions."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place, I'm visiting family out here in Vegas and found this gem in N. Las Vegas on a small block off MLK and Lake Mead. The staff was sweet and friendly, the place was really nice and clean. The food was DELICIOUS. It was like a homecooked breakfast, everything seasoned and just yummy! My new breakfast spot whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Everyone was so polite and friendly. The Food was so good. I had the catfish and chicken. It was fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Great place to eat off the strip. The foods was delicious and the service was good. I had never had grits bowls before.  Yum yum.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We came early to beat the crowd. They have a sign that says \"no holding table\" yet no one to enforce it. When we arrived there was plenty of tables. We followed the sign and ended up standing because of the people who came right in and took the tables! We are STILL standing and waiting on our food with no hopes of sitting to enjoy our food."}
{"text":"This place has really great food and great service. The employees are down to earth. The only downside to this place is that it's a very small restaurant and it can get a little busy during certain times of the day, so you may have to wait a while for seating. Also the seating is very cramped. Additionally, carry cash to this establishment as you will either pay .50 per credit and debit card transaction or their debit/ credit card machine will not work.  But their food is so good. I love home cooked style food. I think they need to relocate to a larger facility to accommodate more patrons. I would definitely recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was great. I got the mix and match- wings, catfish, potatoes, yams and English muffin. Wings and catfish was fried to deliciousness!!! Potatoes were flavorful and yams were you know yams. Only downside is there's a long wait for tables. You have to grab a table as fast as you can when you see one opening up."}
{"text":"Just got back from Vegas and BABY..lemme tell u sumthin! Take yourself 15 mins off the strip and EAT HERE!! You will not be disappointed.   First of all, the service was on point! Every person we came into contact with was so great. It really felt like my family. A couple of my aunts and my cousins and I love it! There was a continuous line out the door and every table was filled the entire time, but someone was always stopping by to make sure we were good.  Next the food. What our table had:  Chicken and Waffles Catfish Hotlinks Greens Mac n Cheese Yams Cheese Eggs Cornbread GRITZ!  EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. I didn't love the greens BUT they were good. But honestly everything we ate was well seasoned and cooked right! Honestly the best soul food WE had in Vegas (others tried were Soul Food Cafe and M&M's)! So good so, that my family and I asked to meet the owner and she actually came out gave us hugs and chatted with us even though they were extremely busy! That's that Louisiana in her!   AND the prices are reasonable! I actually recommended she raise her them, it was that satisfying! Especially when we compare what we've paid at similar places for less satisfying food and service! Y'all go support this sister, she deserves it!"}
{"text":"There are certain places I refuse to go to especially alone. I'm always up for some good Southern cooking but if the area looks like I could get shot any time then, forget it! In fact, there's a place a block away from Gritz Cafe that supposedly has good catfish and a group of Yelpers actually went a few months ago. I saw pictures of the place and decided it would be smart for me not to go even as a group. I'm glad to say that Gritz Cafe is a clean, safe place with good food.  They only have a few tables. The service was superb and absolutely friendly. The food was served fresh and hot. We got catfish with grits and mac and cheese, and chicken and waffles. Their sweet tea was less sweet compared to most places that serve sweet tea.  Catfish: Seasoned, battered in corn meal and fried to perfection. Put some hot sauce and it's perfect! I've had terrible catfish in the past and I was also raised to not eat catfish since \"it's a bottom feeder that eats garbage\" so for me to like this speaks highly of this place. 5/5  Chicken and Waffles: I'm a Roscoe's fan so I would have to compare their chicken and waffles with GC's. GC has 4 huge chicken wings. Roscoe's lets you choose what parts you want. BUT GC's fried chicken was just as delicious. Super hot (temperature-wise), crunchy and well-seasoned. As for the waffles...well, they were marginal. Nothing special...Roscoe's waffles are sooo much better. Even the guy at the next table thinks so! 3.5/5"}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken & waffles in Vegas. The chicken is well seasoned and the waffles taste great! I would give it 5 stars but the place itself is extremely small so it fills up quick during lunch and sometimes there's no tables left. It's worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Hello this is Roosevelt with Amazing & Unique Mobile Detail and Pressure Washing Service my expense with grits Cafe was excellent The Waitresses was great her name is Nunu very nice lady very professional I appreciate the service, thank you"}
{"text":"Gritz Cafe is great. Good food and great service. They are so attentive.  I got the grits with eggs, cheese and catfish. . The location is in a business district not a food court, but it doesn't deter guests from going because the food and staff are wonderful. I liked their wall of celebrity photos (Barack, Michelle, Hillary, and the guy from Black Jesus!). I will make this place a must-visit whenever I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee! Delicious food. I had the mix n match breakfast with sausage link and chicken wings. Nice customer service. A must for tourist who want to enjoy a tasty home style breakfast"}
{"text":"I was so hoping Gritz Cafe would live up to the high ratings I had seen on Yelp. Alas, that level of anticipation and expectation may be what is driving my 2 star review.  I found the whole experience to be substandard to any Southern Soul Food dining experience I've had in my travels.  The menu was quite limited.  Food was not even served on a plate.  Everything was dished out on styrofoam plates/containers and the utensils were plastic.  I ordered the Mix-n-Match.  2 large fried chicken wings and 2 catfish fillets with greens, grits, and cornbread.  The bright spot was the chicken. The greens were also good but I could not find any pepper sauce to accompany them.  The cornbread was a light muffin and sweet.  The grits were good but seemed to be missing something (butter and heavy cream if I had to guess).  Most of the tables in the small dining area were filthy with crumbs from previous diners and no one from the staff seemed to care when I had to clean off my own table and chair before I could sit down. I know we are a long way from the southern states, but this could be so much better."}
{"text":"I love the food from gritz we eat there like twice a month...  But today my gritz experience was not good at all..   It took me like almost an hour to get my food.  The staff was a little rude and dismissive...  Every place has a bad day but today's experience was very under whelming and fairly shocking"}
{"text":"My friends and I were so happy I found this place, thanks to Yelp!!  Small cafe, order at the counter. We didn't know what we wanted, so we were handed a couple of menu's and we had a seat to decide. I ordered catfish with grits and eggs, it came with a biscuit on the side. I probably shouldn't have eaten it all in one sitting, but I killed it!! The grits were cooked just the way I like them, nice and creamy. I added some butter and pepper. The catfish was goooood!!! Hot, nicely seasoned and perfectly crispy!! Of course, I added some hot sauce. If I lived in Vegas, I'd come here several times a week!! Seat yourself, first come, first served. They'll push tables together for larger parties if they are available. Good service, most of the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Grits were very tastey.  One friend eating them described as awesome comfort food.  Their biscuits & Gravy was also great.  The bus's hits themselves you can tell they were homemade from scratch.  Food is made to order.  My turkey sausage was a tad overcooked.    Service was great.  Inside was very clean & well kept.  Very small place with just a couple tables  Directions on map are accurate.  If in the area, we would return."}
{"text":"Just left, second time there this week food was even better.... can't wait to go back... Lol"}
{"text":"Oh holy sweet baby Jesus this place is GOOD!  Fried chicken and waffles!  so good!  We all loved our meals.  Everyone was so nice and the place is spotless!  only 2 bad things:  1) very limited seating, there's maybe 10 tables in the place. you walk up to the counter and the bring the food to the table.  2)  the mac n' cheese was really bland!  so I'd skip that side go straight for the bacon cheese grits instead!"}
{"text":"We decided to try out Gritz because of the IG posts. We arrived about 10:45 am and the first thing we noticed was the small interior and that there were no available seats. Now at best the inside has 10 tables and the lady at the register said they have outdoor seating so we were like \"alright.\" Initially the lack of seating had us trying to figure out where we would eat our food and if it was worth it to eat in the car or just go elsewhere. Now what the lady at the register failed to mention was outdoor eating consisted of ONLY 2 tables. One table was taken by a family of 5. Our party consisted of 3 people. We only had the option of an outdoor table with 2 chairs. Luckily after seating outside for a few a table inside became available and we were able to dine inside.   To order you must stand in line and once at the register provide your name and place your order. Once your food is ready it is brought to you. Since we didn't have a table my food could not be brought to me. When I approached to pick up my food the lady commented that I didn't have a table and where was I seating. Her tone rubbed me wrong it was as if she couldn't see they did not have an available table and that it was not my responsibility to bring my own table. I responded with we were told there is an outdoor seating area but unbeknownst to me the seating area was a joke. I do not understand how or why a person will invest in a restaurant with limited seating capacity.   Let's discuss the food. We had fish, chicken, yams, Mac n cheese, grits, eggs, lemon cake, cornbread, white bread, and rolls. To start off let's make mention that we are Southerners....from where you may ask? Oh, just the great state of Louisiana. So for a restaurant to refer to themselves as \"southern cooking\" and not live up to it is blasphemy. Just saying. Well one thing is evident, the kitchen does not stock seasoning and if they do the cook does not know how to use it which results in bland on top of bland wrapped in bland. Did I mention the food was shall I say, bland? My friend commented the best part of the meal was the fountain drink. I guess I should be happy that they did not have peach cobbler available. If you can't make good fried chicken and catfish you are not whipping up any award winning cobbler. My friend ordered the lemon cake as that was the only dessert available and she took one bite, stared down at the cake, closed it up and was through all together.   Now the food isn't awful but it is not good. It is not worth the price. We tried it but will not be back. Also the staff member that was responsible for ensuring the order was right when brought really must not have been paying attention. Three times my friends had to get up to ask for something they were suppose to get with their order and didn't from drinks to bread to the cake.   If you do not pay attention to anything else I say remember to BYOT [Bring your own Table]."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Around the middle of April I had two orders that were not quite right.  I contacted them and it was corrected when I came back this past Saturday.  The food has always been excellent and the hostesses are polite!   Thanks Trina! Tonya T."}
{"text":"Cheese grits with fried chicken for breakfast...yummy! Food is great...quick service too."}
{"text":"We were on vacay & decided to eat soul food for breakfast, so bomb!!!! Best decision ever...!! My bf and I walked in their & felt kind of starred at first because we were the only Hispanics in the room lol, but I don't regret going ..the food was so good! Catfish was fried to perfection & my bf loved his country fried steak! Wish it was around the corner in California ):"}
{"text":"It was nothing special, the waffle was soggy and the chicken wings were average I've had better"}
{"text":"This place is kinda hidden but very good. Food was hot and good juicy chicken wings... tasty grits."}
{"text":"Overall experience was good, good service, good food.  I gave three stars because my wings were slight under cooked, but I could see the vision. Would definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"I really like this place, I always order the chicken & waffles. The employees are really nice, however the last time I ate there one of the employees was playing music on her cell phone while she was wrapping utensils and it was very loud and annoying especially since it was only 9 in the morning. The seating area is really small so I always like to go early so I don't have to take my food to go. I think next time I may try something different, everything looks really good."}
{"text":"paid 30 dollars for my food  only to wait 45 minutes and never have my food made. I go and ask for a refund, and have them ask me if i want a piece of cake for my wait. that's is insane. I WILL never eat here again"}
{"text":"Tried this spot a couple times. It had been a while since my last stop by but thought I would give them another try but wish I didn't. The food is not worth the very long wait and definitely not worth the attitude you get from the staff and owner. And if you have a restaurant with Gritz in the name you should be able to at least make them. No thanks won't be back."}
{"text":"omg I walked in and it was a full house. the service was exceptional. the food was amazing.. the portion was good and the price was up my alley.. a must try when you come to Vegas or if you live there and never been."}
{"text":"I love to support Black business...  This place was great! I have no complaints. I've been wanting to visit this location for some time now, just haven't had the time. I rode my motorcycle up here with some friends. We ordered all different plates. I ordered the 6pc wings, mac and cheese, candy yams, greens and cornbread and washed it all down with a sweet tea. Everything tasted really great. The service was good and I will definitely be back. I recommend this place without a doubt!"}
{"text":"The b/f and I just had a fabulous Saturday breakfast here and I couldn't wait to review it.  Coming straight from the gym, we were both famished and ready to eat.  From the time we walked in the door, Emma, our waitress provided the friendliest customer service we've had in a long time.  She greeted us as we sat down, cleaned off the table that she noticed was a bit dirty, attempted to fix our wobbly table, and when that didn't work moved us to a table for four even though there were only the two of us.  After perusing the menu, customers order at the counter and then the food is brought out.  As others have stated, this is a small place, so we were lucky to snag a table right before 10:00am.  There was a steady line of customers when we were there, but several were to-go orders.   I had the fried chicken and waffles, which is a big waffle served with 4 fried chicken wings.  The fried chicken was piping hot, tasty, and not greasy at all.  Using my hands to dig in, this was not a neat meal by an means, but it was good.  Emma checked on us often as did the other waitress there.  If you are a fried chicken fan, I heartily recommend you bookmark Gritz Cafe for amazing food and service."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and so was the service. This was the first black ran/owned resturant that I have EVER been to where the service was great!! All the ladies who work here and run the front of the house were amazing!!  Can't wait to go back!'"}
{"text":"Dare I say this place is better than Roscoe's?... I swear it's almost identical but the reason is is arguably better is because of the freshness. Every time I've gone the food comes out piping hot. Literally too hot to eat. I have to give it 5 or so minutes so I don't burn my hands and mouth. The chicken is in more generous portions as well. It's very small and modest inside but they still have a medium size menu. Other items are also tasty and they have the tea/cool-aid/orange juice combos but the main reason to go is the incredible chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"The food wad delicious and the staff wad extremely friendly.  We had the chicken wings and waffle, tender grits and a tasty hot link.  Can't wait to go back  again."}
{"text":"Gritz Cafe has discovered the recipe to perfect catfish every time, best in Vegas! Definitely one of my favorite breakfast places! Not a lot of seating so be prepared to take your food to go."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this establishment is very clean restrooms included. The service was great and the food was amazing. I had Big Gritz breakfast it was so filling and satisfying. I brought half of it home with me and left feeling like I ate half the menu. My other half had a Rich (poboy)boy shrimp sandwich with sweet potato fries. This sandwich has so much flavor it is delicious.. I don't thank no you would go wrong with anything on this menu."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles....  Chicken is piping hot.  Waffle isn't an eggo waffle but hot n home made.  Gimme my hot sauce, gimme my napkins, gimme my syrup, gimme some space. Don't judge me.  Thank you...."}
{"text":"Tried calling at least four...+ times okI think if your going to advertise big on the to-go menu call ahead to place an orderu should at least answer it n put the call on hold....imma still order it thobc it looks like it's I'll be back wit the food review"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas and this was my first time here!! Delicious! ! The grits and especially the catfish was fresh and light.  Highly recommended!! Not much seating but it's worth going!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. The staff was very friendly. I had the biscuits and gravy, it didn't disappoint. Place is a bit small so you have to not be shy and jump on a table as soon as you see one about to open up. The place was kept real clean and did I say the staff was friendly? Well, they were."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for the longest time.  They serve fried chicken, waffles and grits... sinful, comfort food.  The reviews on yelp said the place is tiny, a bit slow (as they cook to order) and terribly busy on weekends.  For my visit, I came on a Tuesday at 11:15, right before a normal lunch rush.   When I walked in, I was relieved to see there were a few empty tables.  Yelpers weren't kidding. This place had 9 or 10 tables, and no where to really stand if you were waiting for food or a table.  There were a few tables outside, and fortunately it wasn't hot that day.  The staff greeted us, and handed us a menu.  I narrowed my choice to the Kentucky: wings + 2 sides, which I chose grits and yams.  An order of grits came with 1 topping, so I chose bacon... truly not a healthy meal, is it?  Stephen chose the Louisiana Hot Link sausage, eggs, and grits with bacon AND cheese (0.75 more for an extra topping).  He chose cornbread while I chose a biscuit.  The food took about 20 minutes, and while we waited, we were served our drinks. Sweet tea for me, diet coke for Stephen.  She even stopped to give us refills.  Top notch service.  The meal was delicious, and not overly greasy.  It didn't look like a lot of food, but it took a while for me to finish it... and I was truly full all day. Even when we had a late dinner at 9:30, I wasn't really that hungry.  I'll be back for more, but will visit only if it's mid-week.  The boss lady said if you come on weekends, show up at 7:00 am or be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Omg l. So glad we found this place before leaving town. Customer service was great, food was awesome. It is worth the 15 minute drive off the strip."}
{"text":"Where I start? Everything was awesome. From the southern greeting, to the newly introduced fries grits nuggets. Was only in Vegas 3 days, but came here every morning...Will be a regular every time I visit!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic find!  As others mentioned, it's a little off the beaten path (and not on a main road).  We got there a little before noon (if memory serves) and there was a line out the door!  They move you through fairly quickly, although tables are at a premium.    I think most people take the food to go.  We ended up sharing a table (by choice, not because we were forced to or anything) with a lovely couple and their adorable daughter.  The food is so so delicious.  My boyfriend declared that the grits are some of the best he's had since moving to the southwest.  Not being from the South, grits aren't really my thing, but everything else was absolutely delicious.  Everyone is really friendly, and it seemed like a lot of the business was made up of repeat customers.  I definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The food was so good and flavorful. Cane from California 2 try it. It was sure worth it. I will be back 2 try it every time we come back. The hospitality and service is the best. Thank U."}
{"text":"Ended up here because we asked our driver for a reccommendation for breakfast or brunch and she suggested Gritz Cafe. It was well worth the drive! We had fried catfish, fried chicken, grits with cheese, yams and greens. Everything was really good! The grits were creamy. The fish and chicken was crispy. The chicken wings were HUGE! It is reasonably priced, IF you aren't being a fatty. The average person would spend $10- $15. We spent  $35/two people + tip. The service was great! They were friendly and attentive. The manager/owner checked on us multiple times. The waffle was ok and the cornbread wasn't what I would have expected. But overall, it was yummy!!"}
{"text":"Had the Kentucky  with 4 big ole chicken wings fried to perfection , grits  eggs and a english muffin.  Bae had chicken and waffles. He wasn't impressed. We did have to wait for 40 min and bae waffles was cold. Overall I thought it was really good.  Everything was cooked well. The portions sizes were good too. The atmosphere is like M&Ms souls food in LA. The staff were nice.  There  were people from everywhere coming through. The only thing I didnt like was the use of paper and plastic settings.for dine in and The seating area is small. They seem to do more business with to go orders. I think they should have a patio that would be cool. They close daily at the  3pm. ."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean, the staff was very nice ! The chicken was very hot and fresh the actual grits were not good! The were served in a styrofoam bowl , the were thick and almost under cooked! I actually like eating on real plates and bowls everything was disposable!  my daughter ordered a turkey burger and fries not very special. My son ordered chicken yams and macaroni and cheese his food was good. My husband ordered a combination of chicken and hot links he said it was OK . I ordered chicken wings and grits and a waffle, The waffle had no taste it was very thin the grits again we're very under cooked the chicken was extremely hot and fresh it was actually very good."}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas I like to try restaurant that are away from the strip and the big hotels, one restaurant that I recommend for breakfast is Gritz Cafe. Located just north west of the strip no more than 10 mins away, the restaurant is very clean but somewhat of a tight fit so seating is a bit limited. When you place your order you'll have to go to the counter and your food will be brought to the table. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and I have to say it was delicious. I love my food freshly prepared and served hot and at Gritz Cafe that's the only way they serve their dishes. Grits seem to be their specialty and you can just about order it with anything. The service was great and the severs were friendly. All in all it was a very good experience. The only thing that I could find wrong is that they use plastic ware  plates, forks and styrofoam cups a no no in the restaurant business. Still worthy of three stars."}
{"text":"Omg the food here is amazing. I cleaned my plate and I rarely eat everything on my plate. This is a must try restaurant. The grits were creamy and fish perfectly fried."}
{"text":"My first visit to Gritz was last year during the Las Vegas Jazz Festival.  Out of the three days I visited I came here to eat twice. It is a small yet quaint restaurant. The food here reminded me of visiting family down South!  You know that family that makes sure you eat real, real GOOD?  I stuffed myself miserably. My thought process: \"I'm not really sure when I'll be heading this way again.  Let me go all out!\" The grits, the chicken & waffle, catfish...all very flavorful. Great sized portions. As it turns out, I am heading to Las Vegas this Saturday for the City Of Lights R&B Jazz Festival.  I may have to pay my \"cousins\" at GRITZ another visit..."}
{"text":"The grits are good this last time was the first time I didn't lick the bowl lol maybe it was a new cook. Grits we're still good not as good. I love how they have turkey options. I love the grits bowl super affordable. Love seeing my black folks as well!"}
{"text":"Now I know why it's called Gritz Cafe they were awesome my food over all was great it took a minute to come out I ordered the Mississippi which was 2 pieces of fish and 2 sides I got grits and eggs for sides fish was seasoned well along with my sides the dine in area was small but I got a table to myself but once it got busy it became crowed and a little uncomfortable but all in all I enjoyed the experience I do wish my portions was bigger but I can say I didn't leave still feeling hungry I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I feel like the food was fresh but for what I ordered it took an excessively long time to get I almost took my food to go"}
{"text":"HOLLLD my HAND BABY JESUS!!!  OH  let the church say amen, amen , and amen YES...   This place food is heaven on earth because , I wasnt really living until I ate from this place. The pour sensation of EUPHORIA and love was felt in ever sensational mouth food. Now its not the biggest place but when I tell you the almost $100 buck spend for 5 folks to eat was WORTH it...  Hell I even flew 1600 miles,home with a piece of there SLAYINGGGGGGGGGG  sweet potatoes and killed it...  Ms/RS Kim,  let me tell you right now, when I come back there I want the whole dayum PIE plus a Pot of dem GRITZSSSSSSS!!!  Thank you for this amazing experience humbly   Kim  Folks if your reading this and close enough to this amazing place run and get you summmm NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from Philadelphia and someone next to me on the plane recommended this place and I loved it! Everything was cooked perfectly. Tasted like home cooking to me."}
{"text":"First time I came to Gritz Cafe I brought my auntie, she loved it. Second time, I brought my big sister ... who is the biggest skeptic and food critic ... she said, \"This is good food. Chicken is fresh and tasty and the waffles are good.\" Which means she loved it. I always love it too! Try the greens too, they are yummy. And like their sign reads, \"Please be patient. Your food is cooked to order.\" So worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in SW Atlanta, Ga.  I've been in the Vegas area for three years.  I've been constantly searching for good food OFF the strip since I arrived.  There's not much Soul Food out west.  I took one step in Gritz Cafe and was instantly transported back home.  The people were friendly and the food smelled good.  This place is small but efficient.  Its the kind of place that you order at the counter then find a seat.  We were greeted with a smile and all questions about the menu were answered even thought the place was pretty busy.  I ordered the combo breakfast that included eggs, fried fish, grits and a waffle.  It had all flavor of my mom's home cooking.  The fish was cooked to perfection and the grits were awesome.  The service was excellent and the staff was attentive. Even the bathroom was super clean.  Bottom line is, if you want some good southern food, this is the place to go.  I can't wait to tell others about this place and return again."}
{"text":"Catfish is always on point, with large pieces.  The sweet potato fries are also good. I like how the fish is so hot, the plate melts.  The only real negative is the limited seating. I need to try something else, as I've been here many times and keep getting the same thing."}
