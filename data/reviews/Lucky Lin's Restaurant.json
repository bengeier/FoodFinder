{"text":"So I'm not usually into small take out chinese places like this, but since my boyfriend was bragging about how amazing the fried rice is.. I had to try it

So the joint itself is really a 1/5 it looks like someone just placed a couple chairs in there and a table or two.. Looks like as if the back would be infested with something of some sort
It's honestly strictly for take out, if you decide that you really have no place to eat and you want to dine in.. Dont.

Overall after almost a 20 min wait we received the bbq chicken with a pop for 6$
Truthfully I think I was just hungry but it was worth the 5$"}
{"text":"I've only had the bbq chicken fried rice from here but several times, I really enjoy it and it's only $5.00.  It's more than enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant 4 stars for the food and price range. Unfortunately, I have to give this restaurant 2 stars for the customer service and experience that we received from the manager. The female manager is incredibly rude. Her demeanor is mean and she lacks hospitality. When she was faced with a question she merely brushed us off like we weren't worth speaking to. 

However, I feel sorry for her staff who are super sweet. One young man memorized our orders considering we are regulars and another young woman who is quick on her feet when accommodating tables. You can tell that when the boss is there it's a completely different atmosphere and setting. 

The establishment seems to be relatively clean. Food is delicious, tasty and incredibly good portions. Yet, I recommend coming here during lunch to get a good deal and your moneys worth. During lunch 2 people could eat for about under $15 - 20 from the lunch menu, soda is included. If youre hungry their portions will definitely satisfy you. My go to dish is the Chili Chicken or Chili Shrimp on fried rice. 

My family and friends are regulars. Overall they deserve about 4 stars. I'm just very disappointed from the service we received from the female manage. This has been a ongoing occurrence everytime we've eaten there when she's present. Therefore I have to give them 3 for a fair in between."}
{"text":"This joint is always busy. It looks sketchy on the outside and inside but the food is damn good. I always get the fried rice with chicken on top, that's damn good with the spicy sauce and the chili chicken is bless too. Reason I don't give 5 stars is cuz the lady that runs the joint is too rushy rushy n slightly aggressive when it gets busy but it's understandable. All in all, great joint for Asian food.  Call ahead so you ain't waiting around inside the joint or in your truck"}
{"text":"The food here is decent. It's just a damn shame that the people running it are rude and don't know how to fulfill an order. 

New Years Eve, 2014. We were at a house party in the area and decided to place a take out order to be picked up at 6:30. We call in the order around lunch time. No problem she says. We arrive to pick up our food at 6:30. This place was packed! We couldn't even get parking in their lot. Thank God we placed our order in advance we said. We go in and there's at least 15 people in line. Calmly wait in line for our turn. Listening around, people are angry. I ask the gentleman next to me what's up. He's been waiting over 45 minutes for his food. WHAT? When did you order, I asked. He says he called in his order A WEEK AGO for pick up for his NYE party. Oh crap! To which the lady waiting next to him says, I ordered two weeks ago for my party and asked for delivery and not only did they not show up with food, they don't even have my order! Needless to say our order wasn't ready. To make matters worse, this genius running the show was still answering calls and taking more orders!!! One hour later, at 7:30, we got our food. Even then, it was only because we cussed this woman out. She tried to blame us for the delay saying that we ordered so late so what do we expect? Late? 6.5 hours notice isn't late. And even if so, then don't take the order! Other people ordered weeks before and she still didn't have their food. We left behind around 40 angry people, some of which were there before we got there. What's even worse is that the genius was telling people on the phone that their orders would be ready in 15 minutes! It came to a point where everyone in the restaurant was just laugh at her.

Now I've called before to place an order and this place didn't even recall taking it. So I half expected this. The only thing lucky about this place is that the food is good. But the lady running the show isn't the brightest bulb. She knows people will come back no matter what, so she'll treat you how she wants to treat you. I personally won't be going back again. My two stars are only for the food, otherwise this place gets squat."}
{"text":"Good value, fast service, satisfying portions, and tasty. Check 'em out when you're hungry for some spicy Asian-Caribbean grub.

EDIT: Our group had the chilli chicken which we would recommend. Vegetarian options are extremely limited (basically just plain \"vegetable\" fried rice, which inexplicably had fewer vegetables than the meat dishes)."}
{"text":"This place is very basic. Nothing spectacular. I only order the barbeque chicken with plain fried rice. The chicken is always good. To be fair sometimes I have received the plain fried rice burnt but I do keep coming back because of the barbeque chicken. The sauce that they put on the chicken is always amazing. The price is not bad. For one order of bbq chicken on top of plain fried rice is about $13. I usually order from there a couple times a year. You would fair better if your phone in your order and pick it up or have it delivered. This place might not be for everybody who is looking for 5 Star cuisine. This is for the person who don't mind having simple meal."}
{"text":"This place is kinda of hidden in a small plaza. I came here to get quick bite and thought i would give this place a try.

The upside is that the place is pretty clean.
The food is mediocre, there are a lot of better Chinese food around the area for similar prices. The fried food is especially...bad. You can tell they use really old oil to fry their food as they come out all dark and black.
Service for take out is not the fastest either.

I would probably not come here again if i didn't have to."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good. Roast pork was microwaved and tasted funny, everything has the dry fried rice. Got and our aoup tasted so much vinegar and left the soup. Will NOT go back"}
{"text":"This place is very simple, has a dozen tables and offers a limited menu for $5.49 and 5.99$ that include a can of soda or water.
It is reasonable clean and friendly. The food is good for the portions you get and the price you pay."}
{"text":"An order of jerk chicken ($9.95) and you can't go wrong. The bbq pork slices ($9.25) are on my fav list too. The portion sizes are huge! The mix lowmein comes with a generous amount of vegetables and meats. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Dinner at Lucky Lin's Restaurant. Met Sue at the cash, she was born in Guyana, bunch of nice friendly folks working at the restaurant. Lovely conversation and good food.  The food is reminiscent of the Guyanese Chinese food in Guyana. The pepper sauce was tasty and added that extra flavour. We only tried three dishes and Sattie was delighted that the food tasted as she expected, delicious!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty basic place, relaxing and simple.  
I've eaten here a few times and had a few different dishes. Basically big hearty portions and the vegetables are flavourful and still have a snap to them.
Order the dhalpurri, but split it in 1/2 and save the rest for later because it's biiiig! Not too much gravy, so you're not fumbling over something soggy. It's hearty and the potatoes are well cooked. Wished the goat wasn't sold out."}
{"text":"I only eat here because their second location is in the next plaza over from my work. (@ Markham and Finch)

It's the only reason I eat here.

The food is kinda nasty after a while. We only usually order the lunch specials. Carribean Chinese is not my favourite. I prefer my favourite Hakka place - Federicks to this. 

But whatevs, they're lunch specials are 6 bucks, huge portions (of sub-standard food) and it comes with a pop.

If you're hungry and desperate cause theres nothing around, i guess eat here."}
{"text":"Take this place for a grain of salt, and admire what it is.

It's the perfect combination of greasy, meaty and huge portions.

It's not the tastiest, and I'm sure I've gotten the runs, but I still eat here.

I always only get the lunch specials, which as eugenio pointed out, are mad cheap.

The portions are huge too, I never finish it.

The lunch specials are broken down like this...
 
(Mad easy, or you just look here : www.luckylins.com/lunch-special/ ) 

You have you choices of meat : Chicken, Shrimp, Pork, or Fish

Choice of style : BBQ, Jerk, Sweet and Sour, and Chili

Choice of carb : Chow Mein (packed with veggies too!) for 5.99, or just fried rice (packed with just spring onion)

All of the above comes with your choice of pop or water.


I usually always get the Chili Chicken w/ either fried rice or chow mein, i switch it up sometimes.

The Jerk Chicken is actually REALLY good. Get that too.

The sweet and sour here is actually kinda tasty. Note that I actually really dislike the real sweet and sour, so that may not be a plus point.



It's a hit and miss with this place..sometimes its super good, sometimes it meh. Depends on your tummy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Roti.  It was very tasty but it was also dry!  More gravy would have made a big difference for me.  The place has lots of seating and the staff seem friendly."}
{"text":"This location has been closed for almost a year now. I believe the Tapscott and Finch location is still open."}
{"text":"Lucky Lins is a take out place mainly serving chinese dishes and some caribbean food too (curry or roti dishes).
I usually come here and get a small fried rice with fried chicken on top for 5 bucks. It can easily share for 2 people. Taste is a-ok for the money.

Ive tried the chili shrimp, overly greasy, overly battered. It was gross.
The chicken roti is something id also like to forget.

Mixed chow mien with chicken on top and Mixed fried rice with chicken on top is great. BIG portions, around 12 bucks each. Cant go wrong with these.

Service isnt ment to be rude, they just get straight to the point."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in a very unsuspecting plaza in north Scarborough. The portions are huge and take out is best for larger portions. You can get friend rice and chowmein with \"chicken on top\" which is either bbq or fried-- it's literally a meal for three. Sometimes the food is better
Than others but great bang for your buck. The chili beef is good but I find that it is a smaller portion."}
{"text":"always fresh and quick...
they will add that little extra touch of spice if you ask for it!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the search for good value in terms of lunch options, and I have settled on this restaurant for the time being. Good portions, great price ($7-$8) and most importantly great taste! 

I have eaten here twice now for lunch, the first time having the chili chicken and the second time the jerk chicken, both on Fried Rice. 

The chili chicken here easily beats other Chinese restaurants I've been too, and was perfectly spicy and crispy. I can't say the same for the jerk chicken however, it felt almost.. underseasoned? There was no jerk flavour or spice that I had expected, and was really more like just slightly burnt chicken. As for the fried rice, it was consistently delicious and really well packed into the container both times. The fried rice also has this amazing smoky flavour (great wok hei). The spring rolls were just your average frozen spring rolls deep-fried and definitely not something I would get again.

Overall this is a place I will continue to come back to when I'm craving a Chinese/Hakka lunch special. As a final point, the food was always extremely fresh and stayed hot even half an hour after picking it up."}
{"text":"So this is my go to Chinese restaurant. Food is delicious and prices are good too. My usual order is sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, and chilli chicken with fried rice. Total is usually around $21. It's enough food to feed 2-4 people. Also service is usually quick as food takes around 15 minutes. Not to forget their spring rolls are 3 for $1. Would recommend this establishment to other. They have dine-in or take-out. Their restaurant is always clean, you seat yourself and waitress will come and take your order. The have a tv at this location as well."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and ordered their lunch special: fried rice with chicken on top, fried rice with bbq chicken on top, fried rice with chili chicken and pepper fish. Fried chicken very good, fried rice just okay. The bbq chicken taste like they put sweet and sour sauce on it. Chili chicken just okay (had better chili chicken at other Hakka place). The let down of all was the pepper fish. No flavour at all. I think they forgot to salt it even though there were pepper bits. We spend $35 for all including tax and tip. Will I come back? No! But i have seem some patrons ordering take outs."}
{"text":"First time here... Co workers say it's good so I tried it. Had the Chili Chicken with fried rice for take out. Total cost is $6.50 with a drink. It took a long time to get it the order ...people who ordered after me got their food pretty quick... Humm ... place is like a hole in the wall... fairly clean place take out system need twerking for walk ins..... now as for food the Chili Chicken was very good portion size small ... Federicks 100% better rice was good but could use more seasoning not just soy sauce ... great place to eat if it's near but I would not go there for their food I would eat somewhere else."}
