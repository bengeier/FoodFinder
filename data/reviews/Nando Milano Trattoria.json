{"text":"Great authentic addition to champaign. Dario and Alessio have done an incredible job and I can't wait to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"It was a busy Saturday night Valentine's Day weekend. We were greeted and seated immediately on arriving. Our waitress Ali was knowledgeable about menu selection and helpful. The food was great . We SAT and visited with a couple we hadn't seen 4 months and we're not rushed at all will be back and back and back"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The atmosphere, the staff, the food, the drinks, and the experience were all excellent. I made reservations online a few days before and I am glad I did, not sure how long I would have had to wait for a table but the place did seem very busy. When we arrived we were greeted and seated at the bar until our table was ready (we arrived about 15 minutes early). The bartender was attentive and suggested one of the spritz's while we waited. The Limoncello (house-made I believe) Spritzer was amazing.   Once seated at our table we were greeted promptly by our waiter and given bread and olives. A wonderful opening while we perused the menu. My husband had a Limoncello Martini which was delightful. We started with the cheese plate which had this amazing mustard, I would go back just for that mustard. The cheese and other items were also very good.   For my pasta dish I had the shellfish and pasta off the specials menu which was a winner (they do lobster justice). I have had the regular pasta and shellfish entree on a previous visit which was also amazing but the special was indeed very special. My husband had the gnocchi stuffed with cheese off the regular menu and if they make it that good every night I might have to get that to go some nights.   For our entree's we both ordered off the special's menu. I had the seared duck leg, it was very good but not something I would go back for. My husband had the Fillet with Foie Gras, this was worth every penny. That Foie Gras was some of the best I have ever had (granted which has only been like 5 or 6 times but it was amazing.) While my husband did not find the vegetable puree special, I thought it was delightful and could definitely have eaten much more.  We decided not to have dessert but Dario, the owner, who is an acquaintance insisted and sent over a Tiramisu. I will now always get dessert when I am there. It was amazing. I was sad I had to share it with my husband.   Overall, I was so pleased with my experience. It's not a place I will be able to splurge on the whole meal like we did on this visit (anniversary dinner) but I could see going and getting just the pastas or entrees for a nice evening out. I could also see going just to sit at the bar and have a couple drinks and appetizers. I really think this level of fine dining is a quality asset to Champaign."}
{"text":"Went to Nando for lunch today and once again, had another amazing experience.  The food was incredible, my husband had the pork belly sandwich and I had the meatball sandwich. Let me say it wasn't just a meatball sandwich , the flavors of the sauce, the caramelized onions and the home made bread made this a one of a kind. And the pork belly sandwich was bursting with flavors.  Alessio is a genius.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Terrific experience all the way around! Trent was knowledgeable, helpful and courteous. The wine recommendation was spot on for the dishes we selected. And the food was fabulous! Great addition to downtown C-U!"}
{"text":"Nice menu on paper, however very disappointing experience overall. Extremely slow service (food came 75 min after we sat down), ridiculously high prices for average tasting food and overpour of superfake smiles of the staff. We really wanted to like this place but nothing was right about it. Sadly, we are not coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian dining - where have been my whole life!!  We really enjoyed our evening at Nando Milano. We went on a Tuesday. We were able to get right in without a wait. Not sure what it is like on a weekend. It was quiet which allowed for good conversation. Our waiter was Italian and enlightened us about authentic Italian cuisine. My wife had the fettuccine bolognese which is a traditional fettuccine pasta in meat sauce. It was delicious. I had the ravioli di aragosta e grandchio which is crab and lobster ravioli with a scallop in cream sauce. It was excellent. Portions were just right. For dessert our waiter recommended the semifreddo which is an almond brittle custard with fruit. It was the perfect way to top off a great evening. We will definitely be back to try out other great looking dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"this place has a lively vibe because the tables are set close together. it makes you feel like you're in a busy big city. we really enjoyed the food - right from the appetiser (mushroom polenta, I think?), the pastas (one with the eggplant, all I remember was that the other was a gnochhi pasta) and the dessert (ricotta torta and the other was something chocolatey).  would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"First time there and I will return. A bit noisy but the food and the service was definitely some of the best in Champaign. I had the Branzino and I would recomend it. Nicely prepared and comes with potatoes and a little vegetables. Very nice sauce also with the fish. Suprised at the quality of the wine selection. I am a fan of Brunello's and there were several very nice ones to choose from."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh pasta. Great fresh Italian food with a cool ambiance. Def. will come back"}
{"text":"Another excellent celebration dinner at Nando Milano.  The food was first rate (my seafood linguine was a fresh as it gets), the service was attentive even when it was apparent they were short handed, the wine was exquisite. If I had to complain about something it would be the ambient music volume seemed to go up and down and that was distracting.  But all-in-all this is now our go-to restaurant in town for celebrations and first rate meals."}
{"text":"Poor integration by bartender.  Server walked away from table 3 times as we were asking questions and commenting.  Plate was less than satisfaactory.  No bread.  Had to ask for it twice.  No parmigiano.  That's enough.  Bribed with shots.......?!?  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Outrageously priced, mediocre to subpar food: overcooked, mushy pasta in the baked cavatelli dish:(!! Ok service but pegged early by waiter as customers who either would not spend much or would not tip well. Would have ordered second glass of wine but was never approached by waiter  for any reason once main course had been served until it was clear we were entirely finished with our plates. He seemed surprised we were actually intending on ordering dessert. Not interested in ever coming back-no malice perceived but made to feel seriously less-than and for the cost just meh food."}
{"text":"Unpleasant hostess. 4 different people waited on the table not communicating with each other. Good wine, decent food....nothing that's worth the price point . Tried it, had a nice time,  nice waiters, good dessert, won't be back."}
{"text":"I dropped in impromptu. I had already heard nothing but praise for this place. You feel that Euro charm when you are greeted street side. It was early and on  the warm side out, so, I found the most comfort at the bar. There I experienced a great exchange with the staff.  But I guarantee that Dario will use his amazing honing abilities no matter where you locate. My youngest son is working here and I could not be more pleased to find he has found the best mentorship under the proprietorship of the Italian brothers. Back to the menu.  The spritzers sparkle and dazzle. You will say hello to an inviting basket of bread and a few olives swimming in the best dipping oil. Everyone recommended the Gnocchi and all I can say is \"womb food.\"  Sit at the bar if you just want to wander in solo."}
{"text":"First of all- the food was out of this world! We ordered a spinach salad, burrata salad, special halibut & special risotto-we loved all of it! They post their specials on Facebook. The owner walked around & was very friendly-he even gave us a complimentary dessert! The reason for a 4 star review instead of a 5 star review is our waiter wasn't very quick, he repeated questions & was new. He even got help from other staff. This won't keep us away though because the food & owner made this place!"}
{"text":"Good food in an evening young town, you can tell I am not in college anymore:) Service is not personable and conversation with staff is limited, take a minute and acknowledge the people spending money.  At any major city this is not worth the $$$, college town +++"}
{"text":"TL;DR: This is the best food I've ever had in C-U.  The Good:  - The food is amazing. I ordered the crab-stuffed ravioli in a lobster cream sauce with scallops and it was absolutely delicious. SO ordered the gorgonzola gnocchi and it was amazing too. We ended the meal with the flan and cheesecake, both were awesome; so was the bread they served with olive oil.  - The ambiance was very nice too.  We chose to eat outside, but the inside was very nice.   There is nothing Meh or Bad about this place. It's the kind of place that make me want to retroactively reduce my past reviews by one star because this is really what a five-star restaurant tastes like. As a side note, it is very pricey. I would definitely say it was worth it, but come prepared to shell out for the quality."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had the sea bass which was stuffed with lobster claw and crab. Sensational dish."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in CU! Service and food were excellent. Owner very attentive. Menu is appealing to all with an excellent wine list."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, as at home in Champaign as it is in its Wicker Park location.  The owner is friendly and overwhelmingly accommodating.  The service was first-rate, and well-deserving of the appropriate pricing - though more romantic than family, we were impressed with how incredibly accommodating our server was of our two under-3 children.   We were thrilled with the quality and exceptional creativity of the food - having consumed meals at Cafe des Architectes, Spaiggia, Tru, and the now deceased Zinfandel in Chicago featuring both black and white truffles, the simple risotto at this wonderful establishment featured the best black truffle I have yet had the pleasure of meeting.  The price is well-justified (and very reasonable) for this wonderful establishment.    We will be back, many times."}
{"text":"This is probably the most exciting restaurant to open in Champaign in while.  The staff still has kinks to work out (wine service, knowledge of menu, hiccups in staging of the courses, having enough people on hand for the crowd) and the prices will be difficult to maintain in this market, but the food is really great.  Even on their first night open our food was wonderful and I've already been back and sat at the bar twice with fantastic results (the polpette are among the best I've ever had).  The cocktail menu has an interesting, if small, offering.  Love the location and the decor. Can't wait to see where they'll go as staff/management get into their groove.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in CU!! The service and food are outstanding. The owner is a true host and treats you like a guest at his home. The rigatoni is amazing. The specials and risotto are top notch. And did I mention the desserts??!!! Yum-o!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pasta! Our entire party of four had the fresh house-made pasta - three gnocchis and one rigatoni. Very flavorful meals paired with a classic ambiance makes this a definite stop if you're feeling some Italian food goodness in Champaign."}
{"text":"Great and authentic. The owner and chef are Italian and their accents shows it. Food is great. The daily specials change continually. Service is attentive. The owner came twice to our table to chat. We'll be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent food! They really make wonderful, delicious dishes, but the prices are a bit high for Champaign.  The service is very good, but sometimes felt affected (too much show when really you just want someone to make sure you're getting taken care of). But if you're in the mood to splurge, definitely try this place.  I never had a bite to eat there that I didn't find great."}
{"text":"Very disappointing overall.  We ordered our appetizer, salad, and entree within 5 min of sitting down which was great.  30 min later we are asked if we already got bread when clearly no bread is on the table.  Another 30 minutes goes by and the manager comes by to check on us.  We told him we ordered our apps an hour ago and we though we would get the apps or salads by this time.  He told us they were busy and had a large party and sometimes the little guys(us party of 2) get squeezed out.  Our food was hot when it arrived but we were not impressed.  We will not be going back.  Beware parties of 2,  you won't get the time of day at this place."}
{"text":"I' been here a couple of time. I might say this is the best Italian restaurant in the area. Great atmosphere and great food. Pasta always comes al dente. The manager always greets us at the table and check how our meal is. Definitely a must try while you are in the area. Don't forget to make a reservation. Seems to be always full."}
{"text":"I just finished a meal here. I had the bucatini and pork filet with a salad to start. The salad was perfect. Fresh spinach with a simple dressing and garlic was a great way to start the meal. Both the pasta and the pork were cooked perfectly for the main dish. There is really no substitute for homemade pasta. The service was excellent and Dario was an amazing host. I have lived in Italy for many years and this restaurant felt like I was back in Italy. What is better is that the good was also reasonably priced. Will definitely return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE!   Coming from Los Angeles, I didn't know what to expect. Carlo, our server, was phenomenal. While servicing 3 other tables he took the time to answer our questions and gave the most wonderful recommendations. Be patient - as your food is made fresh! The wine selection is the best you'll see in Champaign-Urbana. This is not Chili's - dress up, enjoy the experience and tip accordingly (20%+)!! These people work hard!   Having experienced the culture and food in Italy many times, I can tell you this was an exceptional meal. I felt like I was teleported back to Europe.   The best restaurant in Champaign-Urbana hands down.   Ciao"}
{"text":"Dario (the dude that walks around with thick accent - may or may not be real) completely ripped us off the other day.  He kept stalling trying to get us to order more drinks, then refused to split the bill how we asked him to. Party was only 6 people and we all ended up paying way more than we actually ate or drank.  So bummed with his awful service, he is a con man.   bye nando won't be back"}
{"text":"Outstanding food!  gnocchi superior!  Olives served as soon as you sit a very nice tasty touch! Beet salad very nice!  Some service communication issues resolved by the outstanding manager who handled it with style, panache, and humor!  The restaurant is located in a trendy downtown and you feel like you are in a big city.  We would definitely return for the pasta!!!"}
{"text":"Seeing that this is a well review place for a newer spot in Champaign, I had my hopes up.   Walking in last night promptly at 5:00pm, we were the first table seated.   Our hostess was bright, cheerful and had a warm smile. We were seated and brought water, olives, olive oil and fresh bread.   After looking over the menus I was impressed by the authenticity of Nando. The kind of place you have to read the description of each plate or you won't know what it is. (unless you speak Italian) While looking at the menu, the chef came out. Explaining to the table next to us in an impressively think accent, my husband states \"I think I'm getting a hard on for the place\". Not the classiest of comments for such a classy place, but if you dig authenticity and originality, this is you fantasy.   After ordering, we sat and enjoyed the olive oil and bread. Fresh and stunning in flavor the bread and olives were a prefect balance.   Our meals came quickly and in a perfectly sized portion. None of the mass that you get at places like Olive Garden.   I had gnocchi with a roasted tomato and basil sauce. This was the freshest pasta I may have every had. (And this is saying something since I spent 2 weeks in Italy) This topped it all! The gnocchi was soft and melted in your mouth, while still maintaining its form and consistence with the dish. That sauce was aromatic and full bodied in flavor. With a freshness that seemed to blend into the mystery of the cheese that composed of the bonding item in the bowl.   Over all, this is worth and time and money that you put into you. I don't often go for pasta because it is all the same, but with Nando in town, I am tempted to make this break in tradition permanent."}
{"text":"The broiled lamb chops were excellent, however the baked chop was a bit dry. Very few potatoes and onion to compliment the meat. Pasta dishes were delicious. Very loud surroundings and extremely difficult to hear staff or talk with each other making the overall experience a bit stressful. The overall ambiance is sacrificed to accommodate as many people as possible. Our experience was topped off by the verbal abuse of a panhandler en route to the restaurant. Champaign needs to get a handle on this or downtown business could be affected."}
{"text":"We went there last night for our anniversary and the food was excellent.  Our salads, pasta and desert were all first rate and worth the price.  Our meal would have been 5 stars if not for some non-food issues.  Our waiter forgot to put in our a la carte vegetable order and it came out several minutes after our pasta.  In addition, we opted to dine inside and the room was way to cold for comfortable dining.  Lastly, for a restaurant that seems to aim for an upscale clientele, it was surprising that the half & half served with our coffee was in individual tear off containers like a coffee shop and not in the more traditional mini-pitcher.  All things considered, we will return."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I went with a friend and we split the palenta appetizer, I had the cavatelli with eggplant and a Nando Martini (house limoncello with grey goose), and then we split semifreddo for desert. Portions were perfect and I even had some Cavatelli to take home. Our waitress was attentive, the owner made several rounds to make sure everyone in the restaurant was enjoying themselves, and other servers made a couple of rounds to our table. The atmosphere and ambience is so warm and elegant. Honestly, it doesn't even feel like you're in Champaign anymore. Overall excellent experience. I'd give it five stars, but when it was time to pay our check the waitress said she could not split it up. She said she could split it down the middle, but not give us separate checks. Weird... But not a deal breaker. Just make sure if you go with different parties to bring cash so everyone can pay their share."}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent. My wife had the best Sea Bass dish she has ever had. The Calamari is perfectly covered in light coating. I travel a lot and LOVE Gnocchi and try it everywhere I eat Italian. This was the best by far. Totally melts in your mouth. My son is not a fan of gnocchi but liked this. Highly recommend this restaurant and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely superb! Lots of $$$$ but worth it for a special treat. I suspect that if you went there for lunch and just got one entree it would be reasonable. BUT this is the kind of place where you want to have a traditional Italian fine dining experience. Meaning appetizer, entree and dessert , plus one or more glass(es) of wine with the meal and an espresso and cordial to finish. If you do it right you'll spend $90-100.   The atmosphere is warm and dimly lit. The decor is a modern classic style that let's you know you're in a classy place without being uncomfortably ostentatious. I've been to many \"Italian\" places in the Midwest which consist of large portions of lower quality food based on Italian recipes -- you know the story. That said this food is definitely Italian as are the chefs cooking it."}
{"text":"Always a treat to visit. Top notch drinks, food and service. Wonderful timing between sitting down and courses to enjoy each other's company and it's worth the wait for the food. I give very few restaurants a 5 star rating but this is worth it. Start with a light antipasto and work your way down the menu. Dario and his staff are so attentive, they'll take care of you if you given them the respect they deserve."}
{"text":"While I have no major complaints, I gave the restaurant 3 stars because I do not feel the food was worth the price.  I expected out of this world cuisine based on the reviews I read.  However,  that is not what I experienced.  The food was good, but not great.  The service was also good, but not great. Whether our server had too many tables, was having trouble in the kitchen, or whatever the case may be; we didn't see much of him during the time we were there.  It even took us about 7 minutes to track him down for something that should have been delivered to the table with the dessert.  I can say I went and tried it, but I wouldn't necessarily go again."}
{"text":"My friend recommended we go here for dinner because of the amazing yelp reviews. We started off with the rice balls, 3 split between 3 people, each with a different filling. I got to try all of them and they were all delicious. My entree was two lamb chops and some vegetables. It was one of the more expensive dishes offered on the menu. For the price, I'd expect the portion to be larger or the flavors to be more mind-blowing, but my entree was just meh.   If I come again, I'd definitely order the rice balls again and I'd love to try some of their pastas. Overall the service was great, although the food was slow to come out. They also gave us generous servings of bread, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience!  We had a large party for a graduation dinner.  Earlier in the day we confirmed the time and confirmed that they would be able to accommodate us and that we could sit outside We had to wait over 40 minutes and they couldn't accommodate us to sit outside. The service was  horrendous!  We had to ask for bread which took over 20 minutes to get. It took well over an hour to get our food served. The hostess was extremely rude to multiple members of our party and when we approached the manager about this he just said this was graduation weekend and you will not get good service anywhere. This is my third and last time at this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar as it was a busy night for them and we did not have a reservation. Excellent service, great cocktails and delicious meal! We really enjoyed our evening!"}
{"text":"I had a decent experience at this restaurant and would give 3.5 stars if possible.   When I got there, the two hosts refused to look me in the eye, had difficulty finding my reservation, and acted like secret agents (in the sense that they had no emotion, did not welcome or greet warmly, etc).   Once seated, our waiter was very kind and helpful. He even brought another drink with no charge when I ended up not liking his pairing suggestion.   Very knowledgable with the food and suggestions, but did not enjoy the ink-dyed risotto balls or the pasta carbonara (did not live up to my expectations of the carbonara I have had in Italy, despite this restaurant clearly coming from true Italians). Very much enjoyed the veal. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong things!  Overall, I think it is overpriced for the experience, but was worth the try.  Side note: no coat check and you are VERY close to your neighbors. Overhead a woman LOUDLY disliking all of the food she ate throughout my night, despite saying she loved it to the manager that came by."}
{"text":"Ugh. I wanted to love this place. I wanted it to be a cute, cozy Italian cafe that we could go to for a low-key Friday or Saturday evening. I wanted comfort food with some snazzy surprises thrown in.  Instead, I got a whole lot of pretense for some deeply subpar food. I came on a date night with my fiancé, where we were greeted by a hostess with a (fake?) Italian accent. Our table was too small for the plates, the place was incredibly loud, and my food was too salty to eat.  I felt uncomfortable, like I definitely did not belong, and was displeased by the ridiculously steep prices. This isn't Chicago, Nando. For upscale places in Champaign, they should take a tip from Bacaro, which has phenomenal food without the stuffiness.  On another note, the olives were delicious."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in Champaign. They have elevated the service and cuisine to an unparalleled level. 10 stars.   Keep it coming   Our 8th visit"}
{"text":"Our second visit. It was spectacularly good. My wife raved over her crab/lobster ravioli. I liked the pork cutlet entree but the porchetta/chickpea appetizer was the star with the raspberry panna cotta the exclamation point. Service was spot on though one server seemed confused. Sure. I'll eat what someone else ordered. Minor points. The breads they bring with the olive oil (which is very very good) is almost cake-like. I wanted more!  Nando IS pricey but if you're careful you can have a wonderful experience without feeling you need to sell your blood. Did I say it's spectacularly good?"}
{"text":"Nando Milano is THE place to go for fine dining in Champaign. Delicious Italian cuisine, warm atmosphere, attentive and professional staff will have you never wanting to leave.  Dario, the owner, oversees everything like a hawk and personally makes sure your experience is nothing short of excellence.   He embraces every guest as family and will have you looking forward to your next visit.   A+"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place last night as a Valentine's Day make up since we were unable to truly celebrate the weekend prior. When we walked in at around 5 o'clock, the music playing was not quite what we expected with a rock'n'roll vibe that didn't really scream fancy Italian. Maybe it was just the volume level, because as the place filled up later it was barely noticeable. I might suggest more of a big band, crooner sound for the restaurant.   Anyway, enough about the music. We ordered an appetizer of the polenta with mushrooms in a cheesy garlicky sauce and it was FABULOUS. The polenta had a grainy texture inside with a nice crunch on the outside.   For our entrees my wife had the linguine bolognese that had fresh made pasta. I don't know of anywhere else within two hours of Champaign that makes their own pasta, and it did not disappoint. I chose one of the gnocchi dishes that was made with a red sauce consisting of puréed tomato skin and a dash of pesto. The sauce was really well made and had a slightly nutty flavor with the fresh tomato notes as well. The gnocchi were literally light and airy potato pillows. I am looking forward to trying different sauce variations with these gnocchi next time.  Lastly, we ordered the tiramisu and the molten chocolate cake for dessert. The tiramisu was highly recommended in reviews and my wife loved it. The chocolate cake had a thirty minute wait time, but it was so worth it. It came with a baby scoop of vanilla gelato made fresh on site and a couple pieces of fruit that worked well with the dark chocolate gooey center.  I have seen some reviews on here about service issues, but the barrage of people that helped to serve us were helpful and very speedy and attentive to our needs. The owner was constantly in sight and friendly with each table as well as attentive to the details of the front of house. The only slight criticism that I had was the hostess. She was having difficulty with the phone which seemed to distract her from a certain level of professionalism and invitational friendliness that I know she is probably capable of being, so we probably just caught her in a bad moment.  Given the price of the meal, I would say that this is the type of place that I will visit twice a year with my personal income, but I will probably drive by it and lament not going more often. It is so nice to have a REAL fancy Italian restaurant in Champaign that makes there own pasta. Everything they brought out from the kitchen looked good and had the feel of a rustic Italian restaurant in downtown Chicago."}
{"text":"I studied abroad in Rome for one semester 3 years ago. After I came back US, I tried many top rated expensive Italian restaurant in Chicago area(my undergraduate school was in Chicago), but most of them are American- Italian taste. So happy to find Nando in Champaign. super authentic."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite place to dine at. We have a 5 month old and everyone from the host to the owner make it so comfortable for us. The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of great pork chops; so I tried their pork loin dinner (Saltimbocca di Maiale), hoping I'd get something close (considering the price), maybe even a \"pork prime rib\" type of dinner. Imagine three, rather small, very thin, tough, chewy, insipid, very slightly pork flavored, luncheon style meat slices, covered by a slice of bland mozzarella, topped with a couple of small quartered, baked potatoes (the best part of the dish) in combination with a fried, sour (pickled?), onion mixture on top. The sour onions clearly detracted, rather than added anything to the dish. My wife thought the pork dish was decent (she was very hungry), which was good, since I could only down ~1/2 of it. Their bread and the calamari appetizer was very good. The service was great. I think that pork loin dish needs deletion from their menu and a complete rebuild with some decent pork (and forget the sour onions)."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a fabulous experience. The decor is cozy and romantic, and the food is fantastico! We were traveling on business and looking for someplace to have Dinner and I used yelp to find this place as always. The owner is awesome going table to table to talk to everyone in the restaurant the wine is all Italian and is amazing. The food is really really delicious all southern Italy Milan and Sicilian style. We had the wild boar, the rigatoni, and the Lamb chops. For appetizers we had the Aranici and the octopus. We couldn't have been more satisfied by her meals. And then to top it off we couldn't decide on dessert and the owner suggested we try everything so we did! See the photos of the dessert they were to die for!! And the best part is finding out that there is another restaurant just like this one in Chicago on the northside I will be going there as soon as possible. Phone died while posting pictures. Just WAIT! The cannoli is best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food is good here but wait time is way too long. I have been sitting here for an hour and am still waiting for my entree :("}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our first wedding anniversary, and while the service was excellent the food was not. We split the lasagna and we both ordered the beef tenderloin. The food was extremely salty and overlooked. I felt terrible, but for the price point I could not justify how bad the food tasted. This review is 2 stars because our server was excellent and sent us out panna cotta which was delicious."}
{"text":"Location is amazing...we sat outside and was a beautiful evening.  The food, however, was not as stellar...  We shared the arugula salad which was average but decent. I had the pasta with sausage and sun dried tomatoes which was the highlight of the meal.  My husband had the pork which was not so yummy.  Not sure we will return."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. My taste buds had a party and my heart felt like it was in heaven. The owner is so helpful and hospitable. I felt like I was in Milano, Italy for the night. I'm in love."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was amazing, and the place is beautiful. My only complaint was that our table was less than a foot from 2 other tables. I was sitting on the bench side next to 2 other people so close that there wasn't even enough room for both our purses to comfortable fit between us. Because of this, it was so loud my husband and I had trouble hearing each other. Next time we go, I think we will try to sit outside."}
{"text":"Food is OK (not sure if it's quality justifies its price but that's not a point here). Service is sloowwwww. Monday night and only 5 tables were occupied yet it took forever to get my appetizer. This place is probably good for socializing if time isn't the issue."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday evening with my wife for a nice dinner.  This is probably more of a 3 1/2 star place, but I couldn't round up to the full 4, so I chose 3.  Ambiance & Decor:  The dining room is nice, with a good mix of exposed brick and wood  The tables along the wall are a bit too closely packed together, which is a bit awkward.    Food:  We started with the arancini di riso.  There were three different kinds and all three were excellent.  We each had a salad (Caesar and Delizia Tricolore).  Both were pretty good.  For the main course, I had the Cavatelli alla Norma, which was great.  My wife had the filet, which lacked seasoning (salt and pepper would have been nice) and was over-priced (more on that later).  Wine:  The wine list was pretty substandard, given that this place is trying to be more upscale.  In addition to being small, there were lots of more recent vintages that are nowhere near ready to drink.  The prices are also quite high, at roughly 3x retail.  We settled on a 2009 Brunello which was good, but not worth $92.  Dessert:  We had two desserts:  cheesecake and the chocolate cake (which takes 20 minutes to prepare and is totally worth it).  The cheesecake was good and the chocolate cake was excellent.  Like the regular list, the dessert wine list was a bit lacking (no Tawny Port or Madeira?).  I decided on a glass of the Vin Santo (which was good, but a tad overpriced), while my wife had a Cappuccino.    Service:  Yikes.  Here's where things could use lots of improvement.  Our server was friendly, but was clearly faking her way through questions I overheard at other tables.  She told the couple next to us that the 2009 Barolo they had on special would be \"excellent\" with the salmon the woman ordered.  (If you don't know wine, that's actually a terrible pairing.)  Thankfully, they didn't take her suggestion.  She also spoke with what sounded like a fake Italian accent and couldn't explain one of the dishes to someone who asked.  When I asked her to help me choose between two dishes I was interested in, she did so, but it was clearly just a guess.  Our appetizer and salads came out at the same time, which is unacceptable at an upscale restaurant.    Value:  The appetizers, salads, and pasta dishes were reasonable.  Some might argue the prices on these things are high, but they're in line with other restaurants like this.  The filet was way overpriced given how it tasted (I can do much better at home).  Some of the menu prices were just silly, however:  $69 for veal?  Really?  We've been to some of the top restaurants in Chicago and never seen that.  As stated earlier, the wine list was also priced too high for what was on there.    Bottom Line:  If you're going to charge upscale restaurant prices, you'd better have top notch service to match.  I suggest lots of training/tasting for the staff on the dishes, coordinating courses, and wine pairings.  Better yet, have a sommelier on staff and have servers defer to them if wine questions arise.  I also suggest a serious look at pricing.  Some of the menu items and the wine list need revision.  Without some changes, people are likely to stop in once but never return.  I 'm still on the fence, but will likely give it another shot."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a great experience here about 6 weeks ago. We made a reservation on a week night, and were seated and attended to promptly. Our waiter was an actual Italian man (or has an impeccable fake accent) who was able to explain all of the dishes to us in detail to ensure we loved our orders -- which we did! This is probably one of the most upscale restaurants in town, so it would not be appropriate if you want some run-of-the-mill mama's Italian for a family meal type of situation.  Our food was amazing, the wine our waiter suggested paired perfectly, and we felt very taken care of during our meal. I appreciated that the service took time, and it did not feel like we were being rushed through ordering, eating, or dessert. When I'm spending a lot of money on a meal, I want to take my time and make an event out of it. I mention this because I've heard some people complain that they \"take too long.\"   I would give Nando's 5 stars except for they don't have a coat check (or, it wasn't offered to us at least), and I think a fancy restaurant with everyone's coats strewn about on backs of chairs looks really tacky. Also, the first time I stopped in with my father to inquire if we could get a bar seat for two, the hostess was very snarky and laughed, \"Um no, we're booking about two weeks out, you HAVE to have a reservation.\" This was within the first few weeks of them being open, so hopefully they have addressed this kind of issue, and also acknowledged that customer service goes a LONG way in Champaign -- this isn't Chicago, you don't get to be rude for the sake of it."}
{"text":"We have dined here several times and it gets better each time! I had a seafood pasta dish and the other two diners had a pork dish (sorry I can't remember the specific entree names). The flavor and seasoning of each dish was perfect. The timing of our service allowed us to thoroughly enjoy the meal and conversation among our table. Owner Dario is a wonderful host who watches over every detail."}
{"text":"On the whole, this was a very authentic Italian experience, but given the price I expected a better seating arrangement. The seating is quite close-quarters. I didn't ever get the sense that people were listening in on my conversation, but we were sitting no more than arms length away from people on both sides. The service was excellent, courteous, and prompt and the food was exquisite, but I found it hard to relax in such a noisy environment. I will definitely go back, but probably at a less busy time and probably not again as a first-date location. Overall, I'm impressed by the authenticity for a restaurant in Champaign."}
{"text":"We ate here one night a few weeks ago, and it was amazing. Finally, good Italian food in CU! I ordered the lasagna, and it was perfect. Everyone we ordered was great, and so was the service. We were sat immediately, and never had to wait. The waiter was very knowledgable and fast as well. We will be going back there."}
{"text":"Loved the food and  small intimate atmosphere. Definitely a place to go for a special  occasion."}
{"text":"The new upscale italian restaurant straight from chicago to champaign. the buzz is in, and it's the place to see and be seen. The food is very good and more authentic than other chain italian restaurants.  This place could be in Sorrento - not that I'm placing the cuisine there, but I've been to a few restaurants in Sorrento that had a similar feel and taste. The service is excellent, and the atmosphere is hip.  I've had two dinners there so far, and they are certainly among the top restaurants in champaign at the moment, with excellence that spans service, to appearance, to main courses, to desserts, to espresso, to limoncello.  I need to try it a few more times to settle my vote, but for now, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for restaurants, but our experience here was so good that it deserves to be shared. We walked in without a reservation at 8pm on a rainy Friday night. The hostess graciously offered us our choice of table.  (Btw,why isn't this a standard practice at more places? But I digress). As we were seated and given our menus, the hostess informed us that \"the best table in the house\" was available, and led us to a comfy, cozy, well-lit booth in the back of the restaurant. We're off to a good start so far, I thought to myself.   But we were only just beginning.   Our server was very polite and knowledgeable, and the food...was excellent. The portion sizes weren't tiny, but they weren't huge. The spinach salad was perfectly dressed, not overpowering at all, but subtle enough to be noticed. Our entrees were delicious! You can absolutely tell the freshness of the pasta.  Although I will say, the gnocchi was a little soft for our liking. We'll give them a pass though, because the espresso martini may have been the best martini I've ever had. And I didn't think I'd say that about a place in Champaign.   Throughout our meal, we observed the owner walking the dining room floor and talking to the customers. He personally stopped by our table to ask us about our experience. We were delighted to tell him we'll absolutely be coming back. If you need a nice night out, I highly recommend Nando Milano. Just bring your checkbook, you'll need it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We made a reservations for 5:00, we were the second folks in the door, but our guests were a few minutes late.  They wouldn't seat us until the entire party arrived - a \"rule\" they broke for the table next to us.  One of our guests was handicapped, he uses a walker to get around. We called ahead of time to ensure we would have a table close to the entry so he wouldn't have to walk very far - guess what?  They seated us in the table that was the very farthest away from the door, even though closer ones were open.  The restaurant was loud (brick walls and wood floors), so it was difficult to have a pleasant dinner conversation.  The door to the vestibule for the restrooms was not handicapped accessible.  The food was lovely, but the service spotty, and it seemed to take a long time for the food to come out of the kitchen. For an upscale looking place, they didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Very good stop on the way to Chicago. Pastas were excellent and really attentive service!"}
{"text":"Incredible!  Excellent food and service.  Husband and I enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"Everything tasted good - pricey though. Something for special occasions"}
{"text":"First of all look for the charismatic owner that exemplifies the definition of Italy!! His name is Dario, but you will know who he is the minute you walk in. Being a Chicago girl that works out of NY and Italy I can't think of a better place to spend a night with the people you love.  Please choose to have a wonderful meal, but better yet a PRICELESS experience.    Cheers!  Lisa & David"}
{"text":"food tastes okay, but the food and service doesn't match the price."}
{"text":"I made reservations here a few days in advance, and they had our table all ready when we arrived. The restaurant was actually pretty empty when we got there at 7pm. Our waiter was really nice and provided us with several recommendations. They served us bread with some delicious olive oil as we were looking through the menu. In the end, we decided to go with the Tagliere di affettati (assorted Italian cold cuts and a cheese selection) for our appetizer and the Gnocchi Sorrentina for our main dish. The Tagliere di affettati was very good and a sizable portion for 2 people. I already felt kind of full after all the bread, cold cuts, and cheese. Oops :/ However, I still managed to finish my gnocchi, which was delicious! The gnocchi was cooked very well. It was covered in a light layer of cheese and was so soft that it almost melted in my mouth. Since there's always room for dessert, we ordered the semifreddo. My friend and fellow yelper, Sasha recommended it to me, and I'm so glad I decided to order it. Kinda pricey, but your taste buds will thank you :)   I have no complaints about the food here. However, the service was a little disappointing. The restaurant was not busy when we were there. However, we had to wait a while in between getting the menu, having our order taken, and actually receiving our food. The staff was very friendly, but I expected faster service because there were't that many customers at the time."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely the best Italian in the area. It's incredibly fresh and authentic. I've tried the appetizer rice balls, pasta, Tuscan salad, lamb chops and multiple desserts and they are all wonderful!   Additionally, the service is wonderful! The servers are very knowledgeable of the menu and constantly refill drinks and make sure everything is good.   The ambiance is also wonderful- very pretty on the inside and the outside.   The prices are higher then typical Champaign restaurants, but the quality of the food and the great experience is worth it. I would definitely recommend coming here for special occasions!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now. All not good. I gave 2 stars because food is a 3 and service is a 1. Appetizers and pastas are good. The owner is completely obnoxious. He tries to be friendly but he needs to stop touching people. It's creepy and uncomfortable. I also witnessed him berating a staff member in front of a full restaurant. The acoustics there are horrible. It is all wood so it is incredibly loud. I left with a headache every time. I had high hopes for this place but after a year, they still don't have their act together. Too bad."}
{"text":"Both the  menu selection and the execution are beyond anything Champaign previously had B.N.  (That's before Nando.)  This is the caliber of cuisine you would find in Chicago or St. Louis at an independent chef- owned  restaurant.  Especially delicious were the gnocchi with truffles, the lobster ravioli, and the polenta appetizer.  Our meal was simply fabulous and we will come back again soon.  Perhaps since we dined there on Memorial Day weekend that was the reason they were short staffed, but there are some service kinks yet to be worked out, but that is to be expected at a newer establishment in a college town with cyclical labor pools from which to draw.  Even with C+ service, the food is enough to draw us back."}
{"text":"I love this place and will return!! Only thing I was not a fan of was my party only had two people, my boyfriend and I, the tables for two we lined up along the booth so one person was on that side other in a chair. The bad part was... The tables we so close for the parties of two I had to move the table to one side to get out with out knocking someone ones drink off the table or in aiding their space. Other than that the atmosphere was amazing and food was excellent!! I would Recommend it for anyone."}
{"text":"Went here recently and i cant get over this nutella doughnut i had. I also got the fettuccine bolognese. The place is so cute and has low lighting, expensive but great for a date!"}
{"text":"Great food and environment. Ali was a terrific server. Appreciate the owner working the table. Look forward to be a regular and glad to see a real Italian place in Champaign Urbana."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Nando Milano was good, not great.  The service was extremely slow, albeit, a very busy Saturday night.  The bread and oil was also something we had expected without having to ask for.  The manager/owner that was around all night was very generous and talkative.  The food was all excellent, the risotto and seafood pasta dish i had was very filling.  I'd like to try a lot more of this menu!"}
{"text":"We dined here for our 11th anniversary and were pleasantly surprised.  Our server suggested splitting dishes so we could sample a bit of everything -- appetizer, salad, pasta course and meat course.  It was a wise decision but by the end I thought I was going to explode -- I would've stopped at the pasta course.   The cheese platter we got was interesting, but the waiter didn't tell us what we were eating until we were 2/3rds of the way done.    The salad (a spring mix with red onions, tomoatoes, cucumbers and an oil dressing) was a little pre-mature -- the tomatoes were obviously not farm fresh (they had the store bought blandness that most tomoatoes have in the middle of March) and sort of ruined the dish.    The pasta course was my favorite -- we ordered the fettucine bolognese -- the pasta was al dente and was definitely freshly made.   The bolognese didn't overpower the taste of the pasta and it all worked well together.   The final course was the Berkshire pork -- it was ok -- the meat was thin and tender and delicious..... the mountain of melted cheese on top sort of killed it for me.... but perhaps if I wasn't so full, I would've enjoyed it more.  The food was definitely some of the better offerings that Champaign has to offer.  I didn't care for the seating arrangment.... it was as if you were in a busy NYC restaurant, dining elbow to elbow with other parties... and being able to hear their conversations perfectly.  The couple on our right was obviously on a first date, and that was just awkward.   The couple on our left was having a nice dinner too but I didn't need to hear about the flu that was going around their household.   Along the backwall is where they have the \"table for twos\" -- approximately 12 of them.... and they are super small.... with wine glasses, water glasses, a water caraffe, salt and pepper shakers and a tiny candle, it was crowded...we had to be careful not to knock things over.   It felt like being cramped in an airplane..... if they take away just two of those tables, you'd give people a lot more room.... it doesn't need to be elbow-to-elbow NYC dining.  Another negative was our server.   I was always finished my plate just ahead of my husband...maybe a bite or two ahead.... the server would come over and get my plate and then would wait beside my husband until he was finished his last two bites.   This happened with every dish.... it was a bit obnoxious.... he could've cleared my plate and come back two minutes later.... it wasn't a deal breaker.... but just annoying.  Anyway, the food is above average.... the layout needs to be a bit more spaced out.... and the servers need to give us a bit more room to enjoy."}
{"text":"This could have been a bad review, but the food and the charm of the owner really turned this experience around.  Last night my wife and I had tickets to see Dwight Yoakam at the Virginia Theater. We wanted to have a nice dinner before hand and set reservations at Nando Milano for 6pm. With the concert starting at 7:45pm we assumed we had plenty of time. We were seated, ordered drinks, an appetizer, salads and an entree. By 7pm we had our drinks and appetizer, the salads and entree had yet to arrive. We told our waiter that we didn't think we'd have time to eat our entree at the restaurant and would need it to go, if we could have our salads. The owner came to our table, he was such a gentleman. Very gracious and charming. He quickly turned a potential negative to a pleasurable experience. We got our entrees and our salads and were able to eat at the restaurant. And good conversation with the owner.   What went wrong from a customers perspective. I had forgotten the Italian tradition when dining. It is as much about the experience as the food. Dining isn't to be rushed. Had I let the waiter know and made note on the reservation that we did have a deadline to meet to get to our show. The staff would have went out of their way to see that we received our food in time to enjoy the food and make our show.   Advice for the restaurant, watch the Virginia Theater Marque. If their is an artist scheduled to perform that has an appeal to a middle aged audience. They are more than likely enjoying an evening out away from the kids and will be including a nice dinner before hand. Be prepared for customers with deadlines.   In the end, the food was fabulous and the service was excellent. The graciousness of the owner and his supporting staff took what could have been a bad experience and turned it around. Instead of leaving the restaurant swearing never to return. My wife and I now plan on coming back.  And we made our show on time. And even had time to buy a tee shirt."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience.  We were finally seat at 8:40 for an 8:00 reservation.  By 10:15 we walked out with no food.  The manager just made light of a busy night with no apologies.  In all my dining experiences this was a miserable night for something that was to be a celebration."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on a Saturday evening. The staff were very friendly and gave us a very good explanation of the menu options. We went for the paccheri and the seafood risotto..both were great options. The rose wine was a fine pairing.."}
{"text":"Amazing meal, amazing service, lots of fun. The most delicious Italian food I've had possibly ever. LOVED the Caprese Alla Nando, Cavatelli Alla Norma, and the Tiramisu was a knockout! Such care went into this meal. The owners were so nice, came by all the tables to say hi. Whatever the service glitches were in the first few days, they have ironed them out. I am thrilled this restaurant has opened in Champaign."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, the atmosphere is awesome. It's a small restaurant so reservations would be recommended in my opinion.  We got two salads, Caesar and the spinach salad with pears and both were delicious.  Our main course was Bolognese fettuccine and pappardelle. The pasta is freshly made and cooked perfectly.  We also got tiramisu and cannolis for dessert. They were beautiful and tasted delicious.  Service was the best.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Understandable that it wasn't expected to have high expectations for a restaurant that opened within the last week, so by all means my party kept that in mind.   Cons:  Our server definitely was not knowledgeable on service, the menu and wine. We were embarrassed for the place when she just opened our bottle of wine and just started pouring it. Then she asked my friend if she would like some more wine in her glass from the bottle the server was pouring, and my friend already had wine in it from the glass she ordered! Maybe wine service isn't a big deal here, but that was strange for a \"Michelin rated\" titled establishment that they like to hold on to.   The presentation for our food felt lacking, but maybe that's expected from there? I mean it just looked like it was slopped on the plate. The dish I ordered was confusing from what was said on the menu to what was served on the dish.   With said dish, I asked the server kindly if that seemed incorrect to her agreeing that it did look like it was made wrong. 10+ minutes pass and she seem to be avoiding me for the most part then asked \"did he come by?\" No, and who? Evidently the manager. He comes by finally, very animated and condescending of what he thought I asked of the dish. I couldn't get a word in and left unsatisfied with the whole experience that I didn't finish my meal. My suggestion would be to not approach a guest in that matter, and assume the conversation without speaking with them. Just tacky. Couldn't tell if he was the owner playing manager, but we were ready to gtfo at that point.   Took waaaaay too long to pay. 20+ minutes after having the card out.   Pros:  Very cute decor, nice use of space except for host area. Felt very \"big city\" vibe.   Server was kind despite evident lack of training for the restaurant.     My friends all felt the same last night. and I hope this restaurant works out their kinks. Pretty disappointed that I chose this place for a birthday dinner and cancelled reservations at another local establishment.  We went to Bacaro for dessert and it was fantastic and turned the night around.   Good luck in Champaign, Nando Milano!"}
{"text":"Lunched here with work colleagues and we each had a wonderful meal. The gnocchi and Papperdelle San Marco were both especially outstanding but no meal displeased in the slightest.  The patio was full but inside where we dined we were by ourselves. Possibly because of that we felt a bit overlooked on the service as water glasses drained and the final bill came only after catching up with a server--not ours--to request the tab.  Still, it was a pleasant and delectable meal and an experience suitable for a business meeting, \"foodie\" outing, or date to impress. Families: not so much--a bit pricey and children might not enjoy the sophisticated dishes."}
{"text":"Our second visit. Food was very good. Service was quiet and competent. Atmosphere is quiet and nice for a date or romantic evening. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Cute/cozy environment. Pretty loud but that might be because we sat outside. Hostess was really friendly.   Service was pushy and food came out really slow. Olive oil and parmesan dip was gone but they kept giving us bread until we had to find someone to ask for more dip.. Waiter tried taking the appetizer plate away when we barely finished eating. He also tried taking our entree dishes away while we were eating and asked if we wanted dessert. After we said we won't be getting dessert, he gave us the check even though we STILL weren't done eating... When he came back to see if we had put a card down on the check, he tried taking our plates away again. Even if we wanted to finish eating, we had already given up at that point after being interrupted so many times. Appetizer took a good 30 minutes to come out even though it wasn't busy at all...And entrees took another 30-45 minutes after that. When the entrees finally came out, one was steaming hot and one was already cold.  Food itself was tasty. Above average compared to most Italian restaurants but mussels had a lot of sand content.   Overall food quality was good but service needs a lot of improvement and so does the timing."}
{"text":"We are from Indianapolis and we're visiting family in the area.  My wife and I had a date night and we're looking for something different and special.  Well, we found it.  Service  was excellent and was only bested by the food.  My wife had the spinach salad and it was ridiculously good.  I told my wife I would eat more salads if they all tasted like that one.  We had an angel hair pasta with truffles and shared a special fish dish.  All of it amazing.  We have tried several Italian places in Indy and non could top this.  Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Wow this place is fantastic. It is in a loft-like space with a separate room for the bar. The music is nice and not too invasive. The lighting is nice and soft. Nice wood tables with no tablecloths, which is what I would prefer. We went here for my wife's birthday, so I left a note in my reservation. They greeted us at the door and wished my wife a happy birthday and then sat us at this wonderful romantic corner booth.   My wife got some wine and I got a nice beer and we ordered our appetizer of risotto balls which were fantastic. We each got a salad (wife got Caesar, I got spinach pear), and they were also good. The main courses were absolutely amazing though. My wife got some gorgonzola gnocchi in an aurora sauce, which were just pillows of deliciousness. They were light and soft and the cheese exploded blissfully at the end into a perfect bite. I got the scallop and lobster ravioli which was quite good. They definitely know how to handmade their pasta well!   We were having such a good night so we each got coffee and dessert. The cappuccino was solid. My dessert, which was some kind of special pistachio and hazelnut mousse cheesecake, was about the best dessert I have ever had - light, not too sweet, and a perfect end. Overall a great place that I would highly recommend.   Our server Carlo was very good, and the timing of the courses was perfect for a romantic night out. Certainly not the cheapest place in town, but in this case you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive staff, but slow service.  We waited 40 mins to get our appetizer. One hour to get our meal. Our food were sent to the wrong table! We went in at 8.40 pm on Sat night and left at 10 pm. Bread and olive oil is good complimentary but it would have been better if it served warm. Also, woman restrooms were not clean."}
{"text":"Tonight I came here for dinner with my girlfriend. While she loved her lasagna, I was unimpressed. I ordered the sea bass. At $30 I was expecting a healthy portion of fish but instead was given a very slim portion maybe half an inch thick. The fish was not properly cooked as I had to pick the skin away from the fish with my fingers. The potatoes that were supposed to come with the fish were hardly existent.   I was also a little disappointed in the service as after the dishes came the waiter never returned until after we had been brought a dessert menu by another staff member. It also frustrated me that when I ordered us a bottle of wine he tried to push me towards an $80+ bottle of wine instead.   Needless to say at $125 + tip for the two of us (we did have a bottle of wine and dessert) it left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Excellent place for dinner. Great atmosphere and the food was delicious. Our family all had different choices and all were exquisite. Service was excellent. A little o the expensive side but all very well worth it. Tiramisu was delicious...."}
{"text":"Good service and food. Appetizers are our favorite. They were very nice to me with my special request for dessert. Like the place but the tables are too close to each other. Went there several times. It's not a problem when it's not busy, but when it's full, it's like having dinner with the tables next to you too. We could hear everything from the neighboring tables."}
{"text":"What a Friday night! We enjoyed the music and the food! The antipasto octopus with pesto sauce and asparagus was fabulous. Well I would say pesto is my favorite sauce and with bread also tasted good. The spaghetti de mare was a little disappointing. The tomato sauce with a little pesto was great not too creamy but has its own taste, but the seafood not good. It's may due to the location, the mussels and clams were not fresh while the lobster was good."}
{"text":"I decided to visit this place when my friends told me that \"apparently, the waiters here do not know that they are working for a $30+ restaurant.\"  I've visited here on the Valentine's day on 8:30pm, so I didn't expect that much about the service. However, I would say 'fair.' The waiter for my table was kind and nice, and his recommendation for the wine was perfect.  Still, I cannot say that the foods were perfect. My companion thought the saltimbocca dish was a bit salty, and I wasn't 100% satisfied with the pear, beet and cheese appetizer with caviar and truffle, for its blandness. I liked my Gnocchi (the one with cheese inside), and loved the green dip served with the fried calamari.  Tip: Never skip the dessert!! Semifredo is my recommendation."}
{"text":"This is a review for 02/14/15. Let me start by saying that I'm of Italian heritage, most of the dishes on many Italian menus I can make at home; and I'm familiar with how things should be. I had much higher hopes for this restaurant based off of Yelp reviews as well as the ratings of the first one located in my hometown. I should have listened to the reviewers who gave this a poor rating, but after wanting an authentic Italian restaurant by this university for so long...I tried it with my boyfriend last night, with reservations at 7:30 for Valentine's Day dinner.   Alas.   The Good: The ambience was lovely; it was perfect for a romantic date. The tables were spaced about the average they are spaced in most Italian restaurants. The drink list seemed well done, maybe a little expensive for some of the wines. The hostess and the host at the front were extremely professional.   The Bad: Oh, where to begin. The food. The carpaccio. There was so little meat in it that my boyfriend considered leaving the leaves on the plate to send a message to the chef that he did not order a plate of leaves. He also mentioned that he has had significantly better carpaccio, which was still authentic by other Italian chefs, not only in New York City, but in Italy (well, obviously) and in Russia. So. Apparently Central Illinois is too far from Italy. What gives? This is a very simple dish to make! The chef is Italian! What happened here?  On to the next dish. my boyfriend ordered the rigatoni alla peppe; which he did not have a problem with, but was not particularly impressed by. I ordered the gnocchi di patate alla sorrentina. The gnocchi were fluffy, but the sauce...it also did not impress. The presentation could have been better. The portions were authentic, but this did not count in their favor. The food was \"okay\", but the price was not justified by the quality. For prices the same as Boston's North End, and more expensive than OTTO's in Manhattan. the food should live up to money people are paying for it.(I've had better food, in Boston, for much less or the same price)  For many of the reviews here, I almost doubt their familiarity with other similarly priced, authentic Italian restaurants; for this price, it is taking advantage of those who do not know better. Our waiter, Carlo, was missing for most of the night and slightly rude; although it was nice to hear Italian, I would have preferred to have had better service. Il servizio è discreto anche se non particolarmente attento...si dovrebbe portare il formaggio!!! I did see one of the owners or head chef walking around and checking on people; however, maybe he should have been checking on his staff.  Will I go back? Maybe for drinks and a dessert, and that's all anyone should order here. I most likely will not return. Maybe it is because Italian cuisine is not the Midwest's strong point, but save your money for somewhere else. For some of the glowing reviews, I'd also suggest taking a look at how authentic they are- there are a few for this place that look awfully fishy. Perhaps some people did have 5 star experiences, but to be honest, for Valentine's Day dinner, my experience was unacceptable. I'm willing to believe that it could be because the restaurant is still somewhat new, but still! Get it together! I really had wanted to love this place too. There was nothing that we ate that I could not have made better at home; on that note...who would want to pay $$$ for mediocre food and poor service? We wanted a special night, but we were left very disappointed.   tl;dr  ambiance 5/5  service 2/5  food 2.5/5  overall price to quantity & quality 2/5   total experience: 2/5 Would I come back? Not likely"}
{"text":"A friend and I hadn't planned ahead and were headed downtown for a bite after a fundraiser.  Nando Milano was packed, but they were able to accommodate the two of us without any issue.  We didn't wait a second.  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and one of the owners introduced himself to us and even remembered our names by the time we left--so nice to have a warm, friendly welcome.  The interior is very intimate and cozy--not at all like what you would find at a chain restaurant. It was pretty dark, so I saw a lot of people using their phones to read the menu.  The menu is large and varied and there was a very large specials menu available as well.  We started with the house red wine and the lovely olives and bread that they brought to our table and ordered the arancini appetizer.  WOW.  There were three large saffron rice balls stuffed with different fillings.  All three were amazing, but WOW the one with the mascarpone and spinach!  If you go here, do yourself a favor and order this.  You won't be disappointed!  My friend ordered the gnocchi sorrentina and was flabbergasted by how light and fluffy it was.  Mashed potatoes have officially been elevated to something wonderful!  I've made gnocchi myself, and mine never tasted as good as this.  I ordered the lamb chops served two ways--roasted and Milanese style.  It was tremendously good, although with lamb I think I prefer the roasted to the friend cutlet style.  ;)  It was served with spinach and roasted potatoes.  We were too full to try dessert, but next time we will make sure to give that a shot.    This place gets a hearty thumbs up from yours truly.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have three different impressions of Nando- based on ambience, mains, and desserts.  Why do \"upscale\" places invest in dim lighting? Its tricky if you don't get it right and Nando didn't pull it off.  Now to the mains. We went the seafood route with lobster-crab ravioli & one of their lobster specials that night and the latter was...a debatable choice since the tomato based sauce was... sparse. I loved the handmade pasta and the downplayed sauce allowed me to enjoy that difference from packaged ones, but only for a few bites. The lobster helping was decent but the dish was no worth the $35 pre-tax tag. The ravioli was superb and worth the $26 tag. Delicate but not flimsy pasta, noticeable crab and lobster filling, adequate & balanced seasoning, and the sauce was lovely. As were the scallops.   It's only when we got to the desserts that I realized why I'll be coming back. My foodgasms on the pana cotta and the almonds brittle semifreddo were very amusing to the boyfriend. The panacotta is the best I have ever had and aside from a good authentic fully(i.e. alcohol)-loaded tiramisu, it is my favourite dessert.   We decided Nando is going to be our dolce spot."}
{"text":"Too loud so that the wait staff had to yell. Service was slow. Might be significantly better if it was not so full."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding.   Prices were high but it was a fine dining experience with service to match. Pastas are all fresh, the burrata calabrese was a treat.  The squid ink risotto ball stuffed with seafood was amazing.  The scallop atop the lobster ravioli was the best scallop I have ever eaten - superb quality and expertly prepared.  I had one of the specials, fresh pasta with truffles.  It was delicious! The food is lighter than I expected.  We didn't leave stuffed which was great. Even shared a tiramisu which was light & flavorful as well. Good wine, good espresso, skilled staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've dined at Nando's three or four times now, including for special occasions.  Each time, the service, food, and ambiance were stellar. We have had Carlo for a waiter twice and he is wonderful.   You can't go wrong with the fried rice balls as an appetizer, or the gnocchi, or pretty much anything else. (I'm not a seafood person but my husband is, and he raves about their seafood dishes.) It IS an authentic Italian/European restaurant with slower service between courses and not all-you-can-eat portions, which is the whole point -- go to Olive Garden if this is not what you like.  The ambiance with the lighting and music is terrific for a more casual evening or even a romantic one. There are few private tables at this place, but you can put in a reservation with a request for one of them, depending on the party size.  Sometimes I still can't believe we have this kind of a gem in downtown Champaign. I'll continue to support this awesome venue."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town for the first time and came here for dinner.  Service was on point. Attentive and helpful. The food was relish!  Fresh, creative and thoughtful.  My friends and I loved everything that we had.   We got dessert as well. Often dessert is a bit of a let down after a great meal...not the case here. We got three different desserts...they were small but satisfying- just the right size really.  And they were amazing.  The place is warm and welcoming. It really helped us enjoy our trip and our evening."}
{"text":"We came for our anniversary dinner expecting great things. Service was very attentive and our server was very helpful. We wanted to sit outside and it was a nice atmosphere. Their menu is in a classic five course Italian style with 5-10 offerings for each course. Each offering is priced separately. At a place like this, I expected a tasting menu or a pre-consructed course menu but that wouldn't have mattered that much if the food tasted good. We ordered the polenta for an appetizer which was OK though absolutely tiny in portion size, which is par for the course at places like this so we weren't too surprised. I've had much better polenta though. For our mains, we had a ravioli dish and seafood risotto. My wife's ravioli dish was fine, pasta was fresh and cooked al dente, stuffing lacked very much flavor and was skimpy. The sauce was done fine but nothing extraordinary. Now my risotto. I love risotto in all shapes and sizes but this one was probably one of the worst I had. Rice was overcooked, sauce did not carry any of the seafood flavor that it shouldve given the amount of seafood in the dish. The creaminess was not as it should be either. There were a lot of mussels on my plate and they were definitely not fresh. Fine to eat but tasted like the frozen mussels I buy for $5 a pound at a supermarket and cook at home. I had exactly one shrimp and one prawn (it may have been a langostine). The shrimp was aggregiously overcooked, the prawn/langostine was undercooked. This is the saddest part as these looked like perfectly fine specimens of seafood. Nothing was to the point of inedible perse and but keep in mind that this was a $30 dollar dish so I expected much much more.  Overall, for 70+ for two mains and a appetizer (no drinks or desserts), this place was terrible. Would not ever come back here."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with top notch service. I had the gnocchi and it was good, but not quite excellent. The polenta cake appetizer was incredible, however. I wish I had been able to sample their wine selection but was pregnant at the time - however their selection seemed nice. This should definitely be a stop for anyone looking for a sophisticated dining experience in Champaign."}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend today, it was an excellent dining experience.   Their bread is the best among all Italian restaurants we've tried in Champaign Urbana area. The rice ball appetizer (forgot the name lol) was amazing. Its the first time I tried something like this, both of us loved it. Will definitely go back for that.   I also loved the crab and lobster ravioli I ordered. My bf got some kind of cod, it was good too.   The only thing we didn't like was the music there. Both of us are musicians and we cant help noticing when there's unshaped melody or plain lyrics. I'm sure a fine restaurant like this can get a better playlist : ) But with those good food, even commenting on bad music can be fun.   We dressed too \"casual\" for our dinner tonight. But still we got great service. Thx a lot!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because of the amazing reviews from other Yelpers. My family and I came in right when they opened a little before 5, and my first impression was it was very clean and a very nice atmosphere with the industrial feel. I was freezing throughout the meal and my boyfriend had to go get me a sweatshirt.  I want to point out that the bread came in very small portions, it was absolutely delicious but there was only a few pieces and we had to keep asking for more.  We started with the calamari and it was beautifully made with a light crispy batter and two decadent sauces, the green sauce was my favorite.  I had the crab and lobster ravioli with scallops, there was about 8 silver dollar size raviolis and 2 scallops, while absolutely delightful and the scallops were perfectly cooked, I didn't think it was worth $29.  My boyfriend had the lasagna and said it was cold in the middle:/ we sent it back and there was no apology. But when they brought him a new one he said it was very good.  We ended the night with the ricotta cheesecake with the biscotti crust which was fantastic. I really enjoyed it. But again a small portion.  I had really high expectations going into this dining experience especially seeing it's $$$ on Yelp, I guess I expected bigger portions when dealing with pasta.  The service was good and very attentive!   Overall a nice meal:)"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Nando's, as I've heard great things, but recently tried it for myself and felt like they missed the mark a bit.   My party of 8 made a reservation and was told that if anyone from our party cancelled more than 24 hours in advance, there was a $15 charge pp. If anyone cancelled less than 24 hours, it was a $50 charge. A bit unusual for Champaign dining, but I know cancellations are a nightmare so I'll give this a rest.   My party came in around 7pm to the super lively and bustling restaurant. The atmosphere was nice, but it was hard to hear across the table with the volume in the restaurant.   The service felt a little stuffy to me. Our waiter visited our table so many times to ask us how everything was. When taking orders, the waiter quietly asked each one of us if we would like a salad with our entree. The way he phrased it almost made it sound like it was included. I believe 1 or 2 people from our large party ended up getting a salad without realizing they were the only ones to order them. One positive thing I will note, my water glass was ALWAYS being filled which I really appreciated.   After finishing our appetizers, we waited. And waited. Our waiter finally let our table know that our dishes were behind a large party and apologized for the wait. He offered free drinks for anyone at the table, but nobody was really interested in drinking at the time. Our food finally arrived almost an hour after the apps.   The food was good, but was missing something to me. While this is probably the best and most authentic tasting Italian restaurant in the area- I think they could be worlds better if they just cooked their pasta al dente. After tasting the entrees the owner that had been running around chatting with tables came over to ask how everything was. (Where was he when we were waiting for an hour?) Ok, ok, I'm being a little betchy, sorry Yelp. On another note, did I mention how dapper the owner is??? #swoon   Finally, we ordered a couple semifreddos for dessert. They were excellent, but quite small for $10.   All in all, Nando's is good. Check it out for yourself if you get a chance, because it really is the best Italian you can find in Champaign. However, don't set expectations too high. ;)"}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed last night and very loud.  It was hard to carry on a conversation across the table.  It would help if they had some noise-dampening ceiling tiles.  Also, it was very dark and the print on the menu was very small.  I saw numerous people throughout the restaurant using the flashlight on their phones to read the menu.  I had the gnocchi which was bland.  I also had the panna cotta for dessert and it was beautifully presented but had very little taste.  The wait staff were in a hurry to clear our table so it made us feel rushed. Our party of 4 paid about $250 for the dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and have been pleased on both occasions.  The staff -- hostess, owner, and servers -- has been exceptionally on point with their service. The atmosphere is classy yet casual, perhaps even romantic. The food has been wonderfully delicious.  Very much recommended."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Champaign, IL. The food was phenomenal. The service was superb. Overall, a very good meal, atmosphere, and experience that would be fit for a king."}
{"text":"I loved my experiences at Nando. It is a bit fancy and pricey for Champaign but well worth it. I got a chicken dish stuffed with prosciutto and side vegetables, and it was phenomenal. My girlfriend got the gnocchi alla sorrentina and really enjoyed it as well. As you'd expect from a place like this, they have a large wine selection as well. High quality food with an intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Never again! Incredibly noisy and unbelievably slow. The food is okay, if pretentious, but not outstanding, considering the prices and the long wait! If I want to splurge, I will go somewhere worth it!"}
{"text":"Nando is a place for a special meal if you're not terribly hungry. Everything we ordered was delicious and beautifully prepared. My husband had a octopus appetizer that was delicious and tender. All the pasta is homemade and came out steaming hot. My pet peeve is when food arrives lukewarm.  Our waiter Trent was wonderful and attentive as was the rest of the support staff. Nando was pricey, but a treat!"}
{"text":"So, food is AMAZING! A little to expensive for what you get but I would say it's worth it. The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because service was awful. Our server walked past our table multiple times and our drinks were empty every time she walked by but not refilled once."}
{"text":"This is basically my Friday night spot -- perfect place to wind down the week with some pasta and wine!"}
{"text":"The best dish I've ever had at Nando is the salad ( spinach and pear). The best salad I've ever had. The chicken dish I ordered was dry. The recommended wine was ok-good. In total it's a nice restaurant in town, but a bit pricy compares to its quality. Nice staff definitely."}
{"text":"The food, the service, the atmosphere and drinks are all amazing! For a high end Italian restaurant it's also reasonably priced! We love it here!"}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING time here tonight for my graduation dinner :) I came with my sister and parents. Excellent service. We were sitting outside but then decided it was too chilly so they let us move inside which was really nice. The waitress was always on top of refilling or drinks and the food was fast for the quality. It was some of the best Italian I have had I believe. I'm vegan so there were plenty of options to just order things without cheese or meat. I split a salad with my sister and my parents split a salad and they were like starter salads then which was perfect. We all enjoyed our entrees and finished every last bite. It was a good amount of food that I was satisfied, but not too full and it wasn't an obscene portion that we had to take home although I wouldn't have minded. When we were outside we even got to meet the owner and his dog Nando who the restaurant is named after. Adorable! I'll definitely take people here and recommend it!  I see a lot of reviews about waiting for tables with negative experiences. Highly recommend reservations which is what we had and we were seated immediately."}
{"text":"Love the food and the taste of everything. I ordered something with ceab and I asked to have it cut cause I was wearing white and they said it wasn't made for that. Was kind of disappointed but it was still very good."}
{"text":"We love Nando and always look forward to dining w/Dario when we are in Champaign.   Whether you order off of the menu or select one of the nightly specials, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Attended a work luncheon here. Everything was absolutely delicious. Impeccable service. Try the cannoli!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and the food was delicious.  I'll be a repeat customer for life. Very elegant atmosphere."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! I was so excited to go here for a graduation dinner, but it was a horrible experience. I booked my reservation months in advance, but they still didn't seat me until 40 minutes after my reservation time. When the manager came to our table, we told him about the delay. He just laughed and didn't even offer a sincere apology or compensation. After waiting for 2 hours and 20 minutes, our food still hadn't arrived... What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but our waiter, Carlo, asked us to leave to make room for walk in. diners. We spent over $600 and were shocked to be treated in this in manner. He asked us at the beginning of he meal if we were celebrating an event. We informed him that we were in fact celebrating a birthday, but we had to remind him of that at the end of the meal. When he brought our birthday dessert, he failed bring utensils. We were forced to eat with a coffee spoon. It was obvious that turnover of tables to maximize revenue was more important than gaining a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Nando is the best and authentic Italian restaurant for fine dining in Champaign-Urbana. It's the perfect place to have some celebratory dinner. After having visited this restaurant multiple times, I can definitely say I have never ever been disappointed. Dario- the owner is an amazing hospitable host. You will always find him at the restaurant busy talking to guests. He makes sure all his guests are happy and enjoying their time at the restaurant which is highly commendable.   I highly recommend to make reservations for this place as this is generally very busy over weekends. Sometimes even with reservations we had to wait at the bar, but they made sure to compensate for the delay by providing complimentary drinks/ desserts. The ambience of the place is very cosy and upscale- perfect for fine dining environment.   Once seated, the server greeted us with some bread and olives. The menu is very elaborate and authentic, but you need to read the descriptions really well to understand. Our server, Cody is a friendly person and explained everything in detail. Calamari fries was an excellent choice for appetizer- very soft and tasty. I have tried a variety of entrees and they are all very delicious. Fettuccine pasta and Gorgonzola gnocchi are very tasty and popular. But as a seafood lover, my all time favorite is the crab and lobster ravioli- it has the perfect blend of spices and creme sauce makes it very delectable.   The best part about this restaurant is their dessert menu. The tiramisu is HEAVENLY! I highly recommend to try their tiramisu as it will melt in your tongue and give you foodgasm!! I also loved their almonds brittle semifreddo. The servers namely Carlos, Cody and Clay are amazing. They are very attentive, friendly and know their work very well. They even gave us complimentary Limoncello shots.    This restaurant definitely knows how to satisfy all your senses of food. I highly recommend this place for amazing, food heaven, fun filled dinner date nights!"}
{"text":"Service a bit slow, especially for seating in an empty restaurant. Gnocchi cheese sauce was a bit too cheesy. Ravioli was slightly undercooked."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had. The pear spinach salad and almond custard with mango were TO DIE for.  Fettuccini Bolognese was delicate but more run of the mill.  The service (Clay) was ON POINT and he even caught us mentioning my mom's birthday and brought her out a little candle (no singing, thank god). Great music, ambiance, and the food is top notch!"}
{"text":"I like my fine restaurants to be a little arrogant, but then you need to deliver attentive service and incredible food. Found only the former.  Food was nowhere near the incredibly high price we paid."}
{"text":"Delicious food, delightful atmosphere, and exceptionally attentive staff.  I'm impressed.  However, I didn't feel like anything about this was quite worth five stars, and the prices seemed unjustifiably high."}
{"text":"If you're looking for unique and/or genuine Italian food, then you've found the right place. Disclaimer: we did not try the full menu, we tried them out for restaurant week so we had a prix fixe menu. That being said, $39 for an appetizer, main course, and dessert may seem pricey but you are getting your money's worth and then some! Simply because you won't find a lot of the dishes offered here anywhere else. The ingredients in a lot of these dishes are either hard to find, imported or being used so creatively that they feel new. We had a pasta with a creamy pistachio sauce (awesome! Never tried anything like it before) and an octopus in spicy red sauce as our main dishes. Both were great. The tiramisu is excellent!! And service is top notch. You are getting a taste of Italy that you will not find anywhere else in the CU area."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian in central Illinois.  Food is always amazing.  We used to regularly make the drive from Bloomington.  Portions aren't huge but flavor and taste always made up for it.  The gnocchi is always amazing.  Most of wait staff is nice and attentive.  Some have an attitude and I'm not sure why.    We had a waiter drop a steak on the floor and try to serve it to us.  He picked it up and gathered with another waiter and looked over.  I thought there's no way he's going to bring that over.    So he drops off the gnocchi and then comes to my side when I said\"you're not actually going to serve me the steak you dropped on the floor are you?\".  He said no that he was just showing me they didn't put on the truffle oil like I asked) I didn't make a big deal about it, mistakes happen, we weren't in a rush, etc. Another waiter came over and explained that it takes 15-20 min to cook and that another guest had ordered the special as well any they were going to bump his steak to me.  I again said it was no problem, we didn't care.    The owner (I presume) stopped by to apologize and we said we understood and mistakes happen, but were surprised by waiter's actions.  Seemed as though the rest of the night our specific waiter was even more rude and trying to get us out of there as quick as possible even though we tried to let him know it wasn't a big deal and not to worry about it.   Just out of curiosity we did look to see if anybody ordered the steak and in the 30-45 min we were still there didn't see any steaks come out.   Hopefully we didn't eat reheated \"floor steak\" but if we did, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I expected a lot better. We had to wait for about a hour for our food. My dish was very messy and it went back to the kitchen the same way it came out, the waiter did nothing about it. When I got the plate they gave me no tool to even eat the meatless crab. I had to wait 15 minutes for the waiter to ask how everything was going."}
{"text":"A very nice Italian restaurant. The portion and taste were right on the spot. A little pricy but it was a nice dinning experience."}
{"text":"Very slow and inattentive service; on a Thursday evening with only a quarter of the restaurant full.  Very loud atmosphere and sub-par food; especially for the price.  I had the seabass; which was mushy and smothered in a poor excuse for a sauce. I attempted to order a Ceasar salad, but didn't when I learned that the dressing wasn't anchovie-based. The interior look of the restaurant is nice.  However, you can put lipstick on a pig.....  I'm stunned that this restaurant has a four star review, overall.  I wouldn't ever come back."}
{"text":"What a fun and delicious night! We started at the bar for a cocktail. Try anything with the homemade limoncello! The bar is perfect for a cocktail or two! Carpaccio to start followed by the Caesar salad, loved the Caesar! The main event was pasta with a pork tomato sauce.. homemade pasta - need I say more! We finished with a wonderful tiramisu - a perfect evening with Dario and great service."}
{"text":"Went here with friends. The waitress ignored us the whole time. The food portions were small for the price, and I honestly didn't think it was any better that what I can make at home. They didn't refill bread or olives until we asked at the very end (there were four of us and they gave us three pieces of bread) and the waitress was pretty shitty about it. I was never asked if I wanted another drink either. At the end of the meal we asked to split up the check and she said that was something they couldn't do, so that was a nightmare. Not sure if she just didn't want to do it or if they legit don't do it, but either way, it was surprising that they wouldn't. The owner came out to say hello which was nice, but I will not be going back. Expensive and terrible service."}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner spot. Pricey but delicious. They make a great old fashioned. Sea Bass was outstanding!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here to celebrate Christmas with my family. The food was delicious, especially everything house-made: the bread, focaccia, and pasta all is! Prices reflect a finer dining Italian experience, which it absolutely is, and portion sizes allow for a salad, appetizer, or dessert without gut-busting, which is perfect. Definitely fills a niche we were missing in Champaign, and does so fantastically!"}
{"text":"Nando recently opened in Champaign and I thought it would be perfect for a Valentine's Day dinner with my significant other.   We made reservations for early at 4pm on Sunday February 14th.  We got there about 5 minutes early and were seated immediately along the south wall, at the half-booth, half-table. This was good until the place started to fill up, my date thought it was a little close quarters, but I know from experience this type of seating is common at Italian restaurants.   The inside of the place is super nice. Clearly an upscale restaurant, beautiful wooden tables, some really nice décor, and plenty of natural light from the big windows in the dining room.   Our server, Deanna, was accommodating and patient with us as we took quite a long time to finally get our order in. She recommended several dishes, described the ones we had questions about, as well as very generously let my date sample not 1, not 2, but 3 different wines before deciding which one she wanted a full glass of. We ended up going with a class of the sweet Morando red, and I got my favorite variety, Chianti, which was called Ghibello. Both were very tasty, and a fair pour for over $10/glass. We structured our dinner in a 3-course fashion, which Deanna got 100% correct and came out in the proper order. Service was excellent, no complaints at all! The owner even came by to briefly say hello and ask how everything was, nice touch!  The bread, oil and olives on the table were delicious. The bread is apparently made in house, and it was fantastic. The oil was of noticeable high quality and tasted wonderful.   We started with a salad. We went with the insalata valentino, which was a simple arugula with a citrus dressing and some grated cheese. I thought it was okay, but both felt was lacking something. My date suggested an element of texture, perhaps something like dried fruit, nuts, or tomatoes. We decided between this salad and the Caesar, and probably should've gotten the latter.  We decided to split an appetizer from their special Valentine's Day menu. We got the burrata bollicine al tartufo. This was quite good, it was orange and regular beets with a dollop of a very creamy cheese (marscopone?) and a few pieces of truffle and caviar. I saw \"truffle\" and \"caviar\" on the description and had to have it, but there wasn't that much on there. Bummer. Still very good, but at $20 I thought it to be a little pricey.  Our main courses were just single entrees for the both of us. She got the lobster and crab ravioli and I got the cod livornese. My cod wasn't bad, but I really wasn't as impressed with it as I thought I'd be. Perhaps it was the sauce, which was kind of just a red sauce with onions, olives and polenta. I was debating on getting the cod or the pork loin, and should've gotten the pork. At $22, I feel like there were much better items on the menu, including my date's ravioli. If she hadn't decided to get that dish, I probably would have gotten it myself. The raviolis themselves were to die for. Fresh lobster and crab in a rich, creamy sauce. A must-try if you like seafood ravioli like I do.  We opted to take our dessert home. We got a cannoli, and thought it was just alright. The filling was good, but I thought the shell was a bit too crispy/hard.   Overall a good experience at Nando. This restaurant brings authentic Italian food in an upscale atmosphere to downtown Champaign, which I feel is a great fit for it. I honestly felt like I was eating in Chicago, which is host to so many great Italian restaurants that emphasize quality.  My only minor gripes about Nando would be that it is pretty expensive. The portion size varied, our salad was a decent size, our burrata was understandably small, my date's ravioli I thought was a small portion for the cost ($26). My fish dish was huge.   Either way, the food here is excellent and of high quality. If you know anything about great Italian food, Nando is it. I guess you're paying for the convenience of having such fare in a more rural area like Champaign.  Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"This might have been the best meal I have had in Champaign, arguably in my life (well outside of my Dad's BBQ :)).  The quality of everything was immaculate, and I am certainly a big fan now.  My family was seated right away, but with the U of I just letting out a few weeks ago seating was not a problem.  There was one little hiccup in service, but other than that I would not expect more from anybody working here.    A nice wood bar up front, then a charming dinner seating section towards the back.  Some big windows that let in natural light, and a great patio outside.  Inside can get a little loud, but overall a really great feel to the place.  Ordered an appetizer of octopus carpaccio with swordfish as well as arugula, tomatoes and radishes.  Which was a fantastic starter.  The octopus was sliced so thin, but so fresh a tasty, along with being amazingly simple.  I had the spinach salad next.  With sliced pears.  Again, simple and beautifully tasty.    So far in the evening, all the dishes have come out perfectly paced.  Though it took a while to get our entrees.  Which is the only small hiccup with service.  The entrees came out piping hot and incredibly prepared though.  The Linguine Portofino was great.  With a mix of sea food.  Anything from the massive mussels to clams, scallops, squid and shrimp.  Nothing was overpowering, and everything worked together.  On top of which, really fresh.  Which is particularly hard to do with a land locked Mid-Western/Great Lakes town.  All pastas made in house, cocked great, and the olive oil is to die for.  Had a great, classic Negroni, and the wine selection seems up to par.  Everything was about as good as it gets for this sleepy college town, and can hold its own in any of the bigger metropolitan cities as far as I am concerned.  Overall fantastic."}
{"text":"An amazing place. Great atmosphere and food! My first time here and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Our first time at Nando Milano to celebrate our anniversary. The food was delicious. The wait staff attentive. A special treat was an opportunity to meet one of the owners as he was out greeting customers. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I've been to in Champaign. The service was impeccable and the fish was fresh.   I recommend the cannoli for dessert. It might have been the best dessert I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Great food, Martini was excellent, fast service, ok attitude from wait staff, brought food promptly.  Nice touch to start with Olives and good, warm Bread. We have been fortunate to dine at fine Restaurants all over the world, and have never been in as noisy a Restaurant.  It would appear they want to stuff as many people in this restaurant as possible as they have the small 2 top tables lined up against one wall.  No way to have a personal conversation with a couple sitting  less than 3 feet from you. The other couple said they would not be back. Noise level too high and no way to have a conversation. Hope this restaurant makes it. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional. The food took a while, but we weren't in a hurry. I don't drink, but my friends do. They are not the biggest fans of Italian wine and wished the selection was a little more diverse. I thought the food was great - had the beef tenderloin with roasted potatoes and onions, and the lava chocolate cake for dessert."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of girlfriends last night. I must say, I am so happy that Nando has opened up downtown. It's filling an important void of upscale Italian food in CU. On our way out, we run into one of the waiters who informs us he's straight up from Rome! Too good to be true we thought! We challenged him on this notion but it turns out to be true! Many of the employees including the owner are actually from Italy. Not only that, the food is great without being pretentious. The service is attentive and helpful without being overbearing. Actually, I will even venture to say that the service was almost too attentive. When I arrived, looking for my friends, the owner himself noticed that I looked lost and brought me to someone who could assist me with putting our name on the list. Seconds after I finished something, someone was asking if I wanted more to drink or eat. This was all very impressive considering how packed they were last night.  Last night, we tried the gnocci, polenta, & panna cotta. It was all top quality with really great ingredients. The mushroom flavor in the polenta was super intense and savory. The texture of the gnocci was soft and unlike anything I've tasted. The vanilla flavor of the panna cotta is the most \"vanilla\" thing I've ever had. Can't wait to come back and try more!  I would highly advise that you make a reservation in advance. Last night at 7 o'clock on a Wednesday, there was a 45 minute wait for the three of us. It was fine, we just had drinks at the bar while we waited but in hindsight, a reservation would have been smart.  Watch out Champaign, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Went last night for an anniversary dinner, and was completely satisfied. Best meal I've had in Champaign, I think, ever. Everything was perfectly prepared, the service was assiduous but not overbearing, and I will certainly go back.   The only thing I regret is the price; if you plan to have a full meal (antipasto, primo, secondo, dessert), which is certainly appropriate here, then expect a big check. It's the nature of the beast; the same meal in Italy or France would be much more affordable, but it's inevitable that one should expect such a price in the middle of Illinois (or probably in most US cities) because this is considered a luxury rather than a regular aspect of life. But they gave value for the money, at least, compared to some places I've been where basic quality of the food is secondary to the cachet of the venue. I would recommend it for very special occasions."}
{"text":"While the staff were very friendly, the food was just ok and the prices were outrageous.  The atmosphere is similar to that of a bar -- very loud, cramped.  We were seated about 8 inches from another table along the wall.  I would rather go to Biaggi's!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Service was great, the manager checked on us several times. The homemade pasta was better then I could imagine. YUM. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Once again we had a fantastic dinner at Nando Milano. The owner helped by recommending our wine for us and it paired perfectly with our meal. We had the meatballs and the octopus among other things. Both were very tender. We sat in the bar area because they were fairly busy but the service was fantastic and they make great cocktails too. By far the best Italian food around."}
{"text":"Dinner for 2  Appetizers:  calamari  Mains:  - orriechiette w/ octopus ragu - YES!! (It was the special of the night but if if it's ever on the menu again Just do it.) - lobster ravioli - It came with a large scallop!  Super rich and creamy.  I needed something to cut the richness though.   Side:  Sauteed Spinach  Dessert:  panna cotta  Wine:  Chianti and Moscato were both approved"}
{"text":"After my last visit to this restaurant in February, I vowed never to return again. Though I had debated a long time before writing my review on Nando, I felt that I would be doing a disservice to the owners if I was not completely honest about my dining experience.  I have been in the industry for over forty years. I went from dishwasher to busboy, waiter to chef and eventually to owning my own business in California's wine country. I know personally how a negative review can hurt a business, especially in this industry.  I also know how invaluable an honest review can be in pointing out issues that I may not be aware of.  Being a business man, I strive to improve my services to best accommodate my customers needs.  So, with that said,  I opted to write a review that was honest and direct.  It was my hope that it would be received in the context for which it was written.  Fast forward to now...  Recently, I was asked to join some friends for a \"farewell\" dinner at Nando.  I have to admit that I was a bit nervous given the last review that I had given the restaurant, but it was an invitation that I couldn't refuse.   So, with my head bowed low I found myself once again dining there.  Though I was skeptical at first, I was pleasantly surprised and very pleased with the whole experience.  Not only were the dishes bountiful and beautifully presented, every bite that I took was absolutely delicious!  The biggest surprise was when we received the check and the total was within reason of what we had ordered for the evening.  I am extremely happy to report that Nando has truly stepped up their game and deserving of a \"Four Star\" rating.  I'm looking forward to the next time that I'll have the pleasure of dining at this establishment.  Sincerely,  Chef Matthew"}
{"text":"Our Saturday evening was magic! Visit the new restaurant Nando Milano in champaign, the fare was outstanding , original Italian food! The ambiance and waitstaff outstanding! The owners came to our table and said hello ! Charming and elegant ! Salute  grazie per la meravigliosa esperienza! il cibo era superlativo! ambiente perfetto come è stato il tuo camerieri! amore amore amore"}
{"text":"We ate here the last Wednesday in January (there were 5). We hadn't been here since Kridz birthday several years ago, so we decided we should go back for \"We haven't eaten here on Wednesdays\".  It was during Champaign Restaurant Week. So we ordered off the Prix Fixe menu.  The problem with eating at a place that you don't know much about is trying to figure out exactly what you want. So, since we are being adventurous and trying new things, I have no idea what I ordered.  I know it was good. I know Kridz liked what she got. I know she liked the dessert.  Again, I think the only thing that would make this place better, would be a better selection of beer from Italy. There are some really good ones being put out by Baladin. I know they are more of a wine place, but just adding a couple of bottles of better Italian beer, would have me recommend this place a lot more to my beer friends.  Otherwise, it's awesome."}
{"text":"After contemplating for months, I finally went here with my husband for dinner. It's a nice upscale restaurant. The paintings inside restaurant remind you of Italy. At 6 pm on Sunday, 5 tables were filled when we arrived. Our server was really sweet. There was complimentary bread and seasoned olive oil. I would have enjoyed it, had the bread been warm but it was cold. Anyways, we ordered Arancini for the starters and gnocchi della nonna & ravioli di aragosta e granchio for the mains. Arancini: (5/5) I loved Arancini, crispy from outside, soft and gooey from inside. I enjoyed all the three flavors. Gnocchi: (4/5) gnocchi was so soft, it just melted in my mouth. I just felt there was too much cheese for me. Next time I will try the other variety. Ravioli: (3/5) loved the sauce but ravioli itself was dry and chewy instead of soft and silky. The stuffing was fine but again that was dry too.  Overall, I enjoyed the food but my husband did not enjoy his entrée."}
{"text":"We came for our 12th Anniversary and the food, service and everything about our experience was excellent. Our waiter Carlos, was knowledgeable and professional, making every moment feel special. With food and service this good you don't mind paying a little more, it's worth it. We will return!"}
{"text":"I came here on Valentine's Day (yeah I'm one of those people) and had a pretty good meal. All pasta dishes are prepared al dente, which I appreciate.   The price was what you would expect reading the other reviews... but I'm still trying to figure out why. The freshness and preparation and flavor of ingredients are great, but I swear if you closed your eyes and someone fed you Olive Garden, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The ambience is nice but not substantially better than a place like Biaggi's.   All in all, good food. Good service. Prices are OKAY... but given the alternatives in the area that serve decent Italian food, I would feel weird giving it 4 stars.   It's not as great as it pretends to be. And if you're trying to impress someone who's classy, they'll recognize that truth right away. So take that into consideration if you're trying to impress someone on a date lol.  ALSO... for Valentine's day, they packed in as many reservations as they could to maximize $$$ for that day... so we were elbow to elbow with other diners. It was awkward and super not romantic. So making a reservation far in advance doesn't guarantee quality seating.."}
{"text":"Lovely birthday celebration with friends... attentive staff, wonderful food and \"slow \"food meal. Brought out complimentary  desserts and limoncello for table.. wonderful!"}
{"text":"Best Italian in CU hands down. Pasta us perfectly prepared and is clearly handmade by the taste and texture. Sauce is deliciously seasoned and, unlike some other places, if it says it is a meat sauce it has a lot of meat. I had the papardelle and they even gave me a small complimentary birthday dessert."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner we once again had at Nando Milano in Champaign. We started our dinner with fried calamari, delicious. Next we had Caprese Alla Nando and Caesar Salad, yum! We shared the Wagyu Sirloin and Ravioli stuffed with seafood delicacies, amazing! Followed by a flavorful dessert! Can't wait to go again to try more of Chef Alessio's beautiful and delicious specials!"}
{"text":"I tried this place before. I went again because Dario asked me to come again and try it (see compliments). I was excited too because I really dig their food or at least, I did. It was just the service that bothered me.   It was on repeat. I did not make a reservation. I came hella early (it was a weekday). There was NO one there and I still had to wait. I had to wait to be acknowledged by the hostesses (there were two - one was taking a call) and then I had to wait for a table. (15 minutes maybe more?)  The restaurant has a faulty system where it makes it impossible to transfer your bar bill to your restaurant bill.   The server was cool.  Got the bread and the olives, but no refill and we were hungry.   This time the food wasn't good either. I paid $70 for this again??  Nope, not doing it again. Not even for take out.     I don't know. The next time I eat here SOMEONE ELSE is paying because this is how nice people go broke."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite restaurant in C-U. The food was excellent and the service matched the food. Our waiter spoke what sounded like fluent Italian but had a sense of humor about it when we tried to order our dish. There is a lot of variety on the menu. There is no way you won't find something you like. Will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I had dinner at Nando's. We had heard both good and bad things about this place but based on the reviews I had seen I thought it was worth the try. A few good friends spoke highly of this place and their interactions with the owner.  We split a bottle of a Sangiovese and had the Mare Caldo for an appetizer. The presentation of the course was beautiful and tasted delicious. The risotto in squid ink, filled with marscapone swimming in lobster bisque...it was excellent. Highly recommend this!  We skipped a salad since we had a beverage and appetizer at another venue. We shared a Chef Special - the name escapes me but it was a risotto with a variety of seafood including Manila clams, calamari, shrimp and clams. Another amazing dish.   Our final course was the lamb chops; one was breaded and  the other not, but both cooked at medium rare was excellent.   We took the dessert home - a chocolate mousse with pistachios scattered about. We closed out dinner with the homemade limoncello. I highly recommend it!  The service was top notch- if our waitress wasn't checking in on us, the other waiters/bus boys made their rounds. Looking around the room I could see others were also enjoying their meals and some appeared as regulars, hugging and interacting with the staff as if they were old friends. If you are from the Chicagoland area, this place reminds me of the Francesca's restaurants scattered throughout the suburbs and city.  Just an FYI- Nando is the name of the dog, not the owner of the establishment. We were told otherwise and referred to the owner by his pets name"}
{"text":"If you're looking for truly authentic Italian cuisine in Champaign Urbana, this is the place to get it. The menu is structured like a typical trattoria or Ristorante, and the dishes are prepared carefully and with excellent presentation.  But the problems at Nando go far beyond quality authentic Italian cuisine. There is a stuffiness and arrogance to the place that just isn't necessary for this town. The servers are overbearing and condescending. The wines are ridiculously overpriced, and they do not allow you to bring in your own bottle for a corkage fee. On top of that they charge $50 per person for any cancellation of a table over six people. These are the kinds of practices you'd expect at the highest ranked Michelin starred restaurants in Chicago. But they just simply aren't appropriate for this market.  The arrogant policies and practices of this place have chased me away and so I'll get my fix for authentic Italian food by cooking my own at home. There are plenty of other great restaurants in town to spend my money at instead."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best meals we have had anytime anywhere. Carlo was an outstanding server focused on his culinary career. Just a delicious meal beginning to end."}
{"text":"On a date to celebrate anniversary.  Our server (to my boyfriend sitting across from me): It's okay, my girlfriend never needs an excuse to spend my money too!  EXCUSE ME! but the food is delicious. Freshmade pasta, aromatic sauces. Cozy and lively, inviting atmosphere... Minus the sass."}
