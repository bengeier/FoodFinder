{"text":"Rrrr! This place irks me. I want to like it and as far as decor goes I do. I love to look at their rotating photography above the bar. It is stunning. This was my third time there. So it's not as if I didn't give it a fair shake. What really gets under my skin is the prices. If they are going to charge $8-11 a glass for Chardonnay then carry something better than Deloach which I can pick up at Total Wine for $11 a bottle. That's my first complaint. My second is I love to eat Tapas (which by definition means small portions but they are taking it to another level). I ordered the Cheese plate (one of my favorite things to order out). It arrived with only two types of cheese one was spicy (came in tiny squares I think there were 5 of them and one was a cheddar (tiny wedges think there were 3 of them) it also came with fruit but for $11, I thought there would be more cheese. My beef is the bang for the buck factor. Just don't see it."}
{"text":"Three of us visited T1 Tapas for the first time on a Friday night.  It is a small place and the crowd was surprisingly light; nearby places in Birkdale appeared to be packed.

The food was quite good.  The service was indifferent.  The self-help touchscreen menus were annoying.  They are not intuitive, and they are not responsive.  We had to work much too hard to figure out how to use them and to use them.  Ultimately, to us, they were a gimmick that simply got in the way of what could otherwise have been a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food, connection tables are cool."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The hostess told us all their fancy touch screen tables were full (which is, as far as I can see, the whole draw of the place). Five minutes after we sat down in a normal table in the middle of the bar, the touch screen table right next to us opened up and the same hostess sat down and started rolling silverware there. 
We started with two salads: Better Caesar Salad has come from a bag, and the  \"goat cheese salad\" was one small disk of goat cheese atop a pile of unadorned greens. None of the small plates enticed from the menu, and with three strikes already against them, we left. 
The decor is visually stimulating, but the service is juvenile and the food is awful. Just get a bag salad, stay home, and watch Dexter on your own computer."}
{"text":"I did have to send some of the food back but the staff was friendly. Parking is tough but there its always tough in Birkdale on a Friday evening. T1 is in a poor location and the traffic didn't seem that great. its a great Idea but the location and execution need some work."}
{"text":"It's a good thing Birkdale Village has directory maps posted.  I never would have found T1 Tapas on my own.  Who knew that this side street even had anything down it besides residences, etc.?  

We went to T1 Tapas for the first time Saturday night.  I must claim ignorance that I did not know everything about T1 prior to making my reservation.  I assumed it was just a modern tapas restaurant.  Wrong.  It's a wave-of-future restaurant AND a tapas restaurant, all rolled up into one.  You can peruse the menu on the touchscreen on your tabletop, order your food and drinks from there, too, and then kick back and watch music videos, movie trailers, read CNN news, etc. on your very own flatscreen TV on the wall.  It became more than a dining experience; it was an entertaining one as well.  The downside to looking at the menu on the screen was that I had to keep flipping back and forth or scrolling up and down or reading pop-up windows of menu descriptions, so it took much longer to decide on what to order.  It wasn't all in one place for easy viewing for newcomers who weren't familiar with all the choices.

We opted to share the Tuna Tartare, the Tandoori Chicken Kabobs, and the Cuban Chicken Empanadas.  The tuna was a nice hearty helping of raw diced tuna, served with these light-as-air and very fragile rice crackers (that more resembled tortillas).  The Tandoori Chicken came with two big skewers of marinated spicy chicken, and the empanadas were thick and flavorful.  

All of the food was very good, but they were definitely overshadowed by the large screens in our faces, which made them less memorable.  And every time someone set a new plate down on our touchscreen table, it messed up whatever we happened to be watching at the time.  

It's a fun novelty, but I think the concept would get a little old after a few visits.  Plus, I think they'd need more unique tapas choices to keep me coming back.  Our server Joseph was great, though, and T1 Tapas is definitely someplace everyone should check out at least once."}
{"text":"I have visited this place once before. The first time on was on a terrible date, the second time with one of my best friends that I love! I thought the new technology was cool(when it worked) -- you can order and everything from the table, but I am glad my waitress still knew the daily specials and was able to recommend entree choices. I love that they had a wine tasting for only $5 dollars a person. I came in just because i won a free Tapas but I ordered dessert and drinks. I also looked around at everyone else's dishes and everything else look good and mine was very tasty! I am going back for BOGO Monday's i just found out that stands for (Buy One Get One) free. he he he he! We bought a bottle of wine to go as well!!! I wish more people would go to this place! it was nearly empty--it's worth the trip"}
{"text":"We went with some friends who live in the area recently and I have to say I was not at all impressed with the food or the place itself.  

First off, the touch screen \"interactive\" technology concept may appeal to super serious techno-geeks, but I personally thought it did not add at all to the value of the dining experience. I found it to be distracting and not really entertaining.  And, echoing what another reviewer said, I also found that the touchscreen menus were not intuitive and not very responsive. We ended up having to place the order with our waiter for a couple of items.  We also had issues when trying to sync our music and our waiter mentioned other people frequently having issues as well.   I personally think this concept is ok for a novelty experience, but I can't imagine it catching on in a big way.
 
In terms of the food, I found it to be average in quality and overall selection, but not outstanding.  We often go to restaurants where we can share tapas, and by comparison to this place left a lot to be desired.  On the night we were there, they were offering $5 martinis, so our tab for drinks was reasonable. However, the food portion of our bill was really overpriced for the quality and quantity.    

I  would not recommend this place to serious foodies - but would say its worth a try for someone who is looking for a novelty dining experience."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through Restaurant.com; very cool interactive menu, good food, and good service.  Valet parking is convenient also.  I would definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I agree with a previous reviewer, this place is hard to find on the back side towards the housing development in Birkdale village. I really enjoy coming here for a little of this and that. They try to buy fresh and local food which is a plus in my opinion. Everything I've had here has always been good. I love the Raspberry Mojito. They also have a good selection of local beer. The interactive tables are pretty neat also. I like the overhead screens of places around the world."}
{"text":"No No No.  We went there with a group of six.  We all struck out.  

Background.  We went there on a Saturday night.  Birkdale was alive!  T1 Tiapas was alive with a great crowd, lots of energy.

Very cool touch screen table with ordering, iPod sync, wireless, video of table, etc.  Very cool!  Once we got into ordering, it became difficult with the three couples.  The ordering is by table and the orders got mixed up and it was hard to figure out what we wanted because you have to go back and forth on the computer screen to decide.  We actually called the server twice and then he got confused.

Now for the food!  I am sure that the specialty food has a niche market.  But our table of six did not fit into this niche.  The servings were tiny and way to fancy.  Not sure if I can explain,  do you know what dining at a fancy French restaurant is like?  Well it is like the food is all about presentation. 

Out of six dishes, two were decent, one had to be sent back, just plain terrible.   The prices are on the high side, which fits in with the rest of the Birkdale clicky places.  The staff was excellent and our server was very good.

So, if you want to go and have a good meal, I would suggest you move on, but if you are into that kind of cuisine, by all means, have at it."}
{"text":"Our adventures at T1 were purely by accident. We'd just caught a movie at Birkdale and exited back out into the night feeling famished. Turns out it was Charlotte's Restaurant Week and a lot of the restaurants in the shopping area were participating (read: so ludicrously busy we'd be waiting for a table for some time). That's when we caught the sidewalk chalk message and corresponding arrow leading us around a corner to T1. 

It's difficult to distinguish what this place is from the exterior. The darkly tinted windows hide a \"futuristic\" dining experience where servers have largely been replaced by computers (they remain available to answer questions and deliver food.... for now - dun, dun, DUN). Being a server myself, there was something ever so slightly creepy about this. Nonetheless, we slid into our cozy little booth and went to work playing with the touch screen menu. 

The menu was mouthwatering. And ridiculously thorough. Because it's computerized, you can bring up as much information about a dish as you'd like. The descriptions are quite detailed - something prevented by the limitations of printed menus. A full color pictures of each dish let's you see exactly what you're in for. Again - this makes the server rather useless. Most difficult was not figuring out how to use the menus, but narrowing our small plates down to a reasonable number. The menu is full of imaginative dishes inspired, it seems, by all the cuisines of the world, from traditional Spanish tapas, to Indian, Cuban and American flavors.

Most of what we chose was just as satisfying as expected, with the one exception of the tandori chicken skewers. These were a little on the dry side and not as flavorful as I'd hoped. Still - nothing blew us out of the water. Its was all just (as the stars would indicate) A-OK. 

(And I'm still scared of being replaced by robots, which may have pulled the rating down a little...)

Anyway, the last feature of note is the screen in front of you that serves as part of the ordering process. Once you're food has been delivered (or as you're waiting for it), you can select from several entertainment option including You Tube clips, television shows and photographs. Makes for interesting viewing during the meal, but it was also a little distracting. I'm not much for watching TV during a meal, and it did cut down on the normal conversation we'd typically have at dinner. 

More intriguing were the music options. Not only did they have several music stations for you to chose from, but you can forgo their selections altogether and plug in your iPod. Each table offers a docking station (being able to match the dinner music to your mood? priceless).  Now that's something I wish more restaurants would latch onto. You know what - just for that, I feel I can pump this one up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good food and drink with touch screen ordering.  Sync your iPod to your booth and listen to music, watch video or scroll through your photo library."}
{"text":"Rrrr! This place irks me like it irks my GF. It is the kind of place that usually has seating when other places are packed, but the bartenders are less than steller and the prices are just too high.

It is only a hail-mary choice when the rest of the Birk is slammed busy."}
{"text":"Come here to have a good time and enjoy a modern, trendy restaurant, but be prepared to leave completely frustrated and angry at how much you just spent on almost nothing.

I get this is a \"tapas\" place, but that doesn't mean you can charge $13 for a burger that's smaller than a McDonald's burger, and doesn't even taste as good... or some chicken skewers with 3 oz. of meat for $9.00.  But this is the pattern for everything on the menu.  Everything is described in so much detail that you think you're going to get your plate and say \"yea, it was small, but I enjoyed it.\"  Well, this isn't a college hookup, but more so like prom night where you say \"yea, it was small and I'm not quite sure what happened, but it was done in less than a minute\"  So sorry.  

If you're going to bother going here, then you have to make sure you get the entertainment/digital booths in the far right corner.  if they aren't available when you arrive, wait for them.  Call ahead if you can to reserve/request them.  These booths are pretty awesome, I have to admit.  You can watch music videos, hook up your own iPod, play games, and even has an interactive menu you use to order without having to wait for the waitress.  In summary, the digital table makes this a whole different experience.  However, there's only 4 of them in the entire place, and that ridiculously pricey food you're eating is paying for them.  Therefore, if you're not in them and you're eating, you're getting ripped off."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorites... now it is average at best. When they first opened, it was just the best combination of cool concept with the connection booths and excellent food. The ingredients they used were fresh, mostly locally sourced and the chef prepared them with a delicate hand. 

Went back two weeks ago for the first time in a few months and was excited to do so. Until we ate... I could hardly believe this was the same restaurant other than the connection booths. Seared scallops were not seared but were over-cooked. Shrimp with white wine/garlic tasted frozen although the broth was good enough for dipping bread in. As always, we ordered a big variety of plates and shared amongst the table so I was able to taste much of the menu. SO disappointing. 

If this had been my first visit, it would also have been my last. There HAS to be a new chef back there because this is not the same food they served when they opened. Word to owners... No matter how cool your concept is (and the connection booths are way cool), no restaurant can make it when the kitchen produces mediocrity. Please get back to what you used to be!"}
