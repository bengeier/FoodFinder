{"text":"Vivek, you beat me to this review lol! I enjoy a shawarma occasionally (at one time I was eating them 3 times a week).  The guys who originally opened this place has left and it's an odd story cos they're almost like moving nomads.  They were brothers or cousins (I can't recall) and they're Lebanese and polite but not overly so.  I was first introduced to Middle Eastern food about 7 years ago when they had this Pita Express place near Richmond-Victoria streets which has long closed. It was good so that started my search for the ultimate shawarma.  These places are popping up like dandelions (sushi was over populating us but now these places are excessive). 

Back to the review on this place.  Like I said, the original guys were on Yonge St. (east side of the street) south of Carlton.  They closed and moved north to 618 Yonge St (between Bloor-Wellesley) to a place called Pita Q and then left there to open Wrap & Grab on Dundas.  They have since left and went back to their original spot called Lebanese Express (it's 399 or 439 Yonge St) and I haven't seen him recently so I assumed he's moved again? The reason I liked their shawarma was because they lightly toasted the pita and they also made a huge one for me (maybe I looked like a buffet eater lol? I don't know... but it was huge and good value).

The down side is that I'm spoiled so when I get these huge shawarmas that are big and good value, every time I go elsewhere, they're disappointing.  Recently, the shawarma's have been inconsistent in size (sometimes large and sometimes small like a hot dog).  The prices are higher too as they used to be under $4 but now they're closer to $5 with our HST.  Hmmm, that makes the Subway sandwich more attractive if I'm hungry lol.  But it's the taste I crave and the way he toasts his pita.  He does leave his mark wherever he goes as they still follow his formula.  The service here is OK as they're all business (not too many smiles or jokes unless you speak their language).  It's really 3.5 stars due to their inconsistency but the place is clean and the shawarma is still tasty and good value."}
{"text":"Not the best in town, I assume; but I must say - I have tried a LOT of shawarma places (reviews coming up as I re-visit all of them after having joined Yelp) - it matches what I have eaten at most places if not all (Yes, my quest for the ultimate shawarma is far from over). 

Food: 
- For a take-out place, it's pretty good. You can get more or exclude whatever you want, but you have to tell them. 
- I usually go for a combo - a chicken shawarma and a kabab shawarma for $9 (incl tax) = that's a pretty good meal.
- I haven't tried their smoothies / juices yet; waiting for the summer for those.
- there're other things, like \"lebanese pizzas\" and stuff like that. Don't look very appetizing. And they're not. If you're feeling adventurous, go for it. I did and I won't give that another try.
- Because I haven't found an awesome shawarma yet, I'll give them 4/5 for the shawarmas.
- Overall food: 3/5

Price:
- for a downtown location and the quality/quantity, it's pretty good. 
- Price rating: 5/5

Decor:
- seriously? c'mon... It's a shawarma place. It's called Wrap & Grab. You're not here for the decor. 
- There are a few uncomfortable plastic-y bar stools (I wonder why they couldn't just have regular circular tables and chairs like you have in a cheap cafeteria). 
- There's a TV that plays CP24 all the time. I don't expect many people to sit there, unless they don't want to take the hot shawarma anywhere else.
- no washroom (so you MUST \"grab\" your food if you want to \"go\"... and by \"go\", I don't mean \"leave\"... =P
Decor rating: not-existing / 5.

Service:
- I found they are pretty good - fast; understand what you want; will ask you about things you don't specify (hot sauce? garlic? onions? - I assume these are the typical no-nos... I on the other hand want extra everything... but I digress, back to the review:)
- Respectful - I find this to be an issue with a lot of take-out places. These guys are busy, I don't expect them to laugh and joke with me, but polite 
overall. 
- For certain orders (like the kabab shawarma), it takes time because they cook the kabab right there - the wait is 10 minutes). I call ahead, order over the phone, and show up 10 minutes later.
- Service rating: 4/5 (I won't give them 5/5 coz it's not a proper restaurant. I'll take off a star to be fair to the other 5/5s I may give. For a take-out place, it's pretty good). 

Why to go there:
- cheap, quick meal (i speak for the shawarmas. other things - not so much, maybe the smoothies/juices..)
- good quantity
- good service

Why not to go there:
- definitely not a place to sit and eat (walk over to Nathan Phillips or something nearby)
- for a first date - uhhh.... =P"}
{"text":"First off, I'm from a middle eastern background, so I grew up with this kind of food. We went to this place,when we came to Toronto to visit, because it was so close to our hotel (the Metropolitan,go figure)....me,(the Canadian) + 3 Italian visitors. I raved about middle eastern food to them. Then we went in to this place. What a mistake! We walked in, and I immediately saw the unappealing and ancient pizza slices that were sitting under glass, looking like they had been sitting there for days. Same goes for a half dozen samosas sitting on their counter.(Samosas? \"Lebanese\" cuisine?) 
The rice was not \"Lebanese\" but more \"Indian\"....there was clearly curry added to it,plus it was dry and chewy,easy to tell it had been sitting under those lamps pretty much all day. The tabouleh consisted of chopped parsley, and diced tomatoes....thats it!....no olive oil, no lemon, no onions and no garlic.
 The hummous was runny and bland.....barely any tahini, no lemon, no garlic...blah! It was so runny, that it just soaked the rest of the food on our plates,making everything soggy. I hadnt eaten humous this lousy since I went to Bulgaria.
 The salata was bland and lacked any taste....the only thing passable on our plates were the felafel croquettes,which were fried on the spot for us,but when the guy asked us if we wanted sauce on them (tahini and \"hot\" sauce) we ended up with beige colored water and watery red sauce,both with absolutely no flavour at all! I couldnt believe how much this food sucked. By far the worst middle eastern food I ever had :( To make matters worse, while we were eating, all of the sudden the room became mysteriously cold,to the point I had to put my ski coat back on. I turn around and realise that the owners decide to open the door to air out some smoke. But I guess it was ok if 4 customers are sitting there freezing their butts off. I politely asked them if they could close it, and they did. I looked at the plates of my 3 friends, and most of it was going to be tossed. I forced myself to swallow the rest of what was on my plate,first time in my life not enjoying middle eastern food. I will never recommend this place to anyone,nor will I ever set foot in it ever again....obviously!"}
{"text":"Very decently priced place. They didn't have shish tawook or chicken breast on their menu so I was forced to go to Ali baba down the road for my fiance which was a disaster piece of food compared to Wrap and Grab's chicken shawarma. I've been here a few times they are pretty good in timeliness and service and their food is above average as well. I've seen the same people working here over the one or two visits over 3 years."}
{"text":"This place has wicked shwarma and the price is good too. The food is very filling. Just get there early to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Ordered the falafel plate, which I think must be meant for two or more people. I mean, there were 6 falafel balls on top of rice and other vegetables. That was way too much food for one person for so cheap. Service was good, and the food showed up quick."}
{"text":"i think this place is wonderful!
my personal fav is fatoosh shawarma salad. its light yet filling, has all the necessary components of healthy lunch. 
All items are reasonably priced, the food tastes great, at least to my standards (and i consider my food standards pretty high).
what i look for the most in a restaurant/eatery is fresh ingredients and healthy method of preparation. this place has got my vote!
I'm there at least once a week ( i try to brown bag most of the time, but cant refuse myself the treat at least once a week.)
don't get me wrong this place will not compare to The Sultan's Tent, but as a quick, cheap, AND HEALTHY, lunch i don't think many places can beat this joint"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  The meat has no flavour, they cover it with  so much sauce making it a soppy mess that breaks open after the first few bites.  The fries are nasty (i was desperate), the samosa was even worse (i threw it out after the first bite).  

It used to be good many years ago when they first opened.  But it's been bad for a long time now.  

And when you say \"no onions\"...keep an eye on the guy because you'll have to remind him...everytime."}
{"text":"They do not answer their phone and there isn't a way to know if they are open or not. I've moved on to the next hookah lounge on the list."}
{"text":"The food was dry and old. The quantity was low. Customer service pathetic.

We ordered the kabob plate for 11 bucks with tax.
The lettuce was dry and old. Grossed out. The hummus tasted sour. The rice was bland, with no taste at all. 

There were like 4 potatoes atmost all over fried and dry. I showed it to the server. Worst reaction. Oh just the heat dried  it and then the guy completely ignored and went back on his phone. No apologies let alone exchange the food. Even the kabobs were the driest ones I have ever tastes

Even the temperature was cold.

Seems like everything is made in excess quantity with no care for how the food is served to customers."}
{"text":"I just want to start off saying that the overall experience was nice. Having said that make sure to ask the prices before selecting the hookah. 

Before going, I read the reviews on Yelp and others have said it was $13 for a hookah. After sitting there for about an hour we went to pay our bill. The gentleman working said it was $44.95!!!! I inquired about the high charge and he originally said it is unlimited hookahs on Friday and Saturday nights....I then reminded him it was a Sunday night and he quickly changed his story and said unlimited hookahs on Friday, Saturday, and Sundays. 

I asked him where it shows the prices for the hookah and he said with a smile \"it's just how it is\"....that's interesting! That's how it is?! I wish I can use that same verbiage in my job!

I am not saying don't go to this place but just beware that the prices might be a lot higher then you expect.

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Sweet deal for the price for the shwarma. The guys are super nice (always \"what would you like my friend?\"), and the service is super fast. However they always seem to be out of beef whenever I visit.."}
{"text":"The people at Wrap & Grab have managed to turn an uncomplicated meal into a sopping mess. 

I ordered the falafel platter to go. The falafel balls were hard as a rock and weren't cooked fresh in front of me. Though I try not to waste food I ended up throwing away most of the rice as it was stale and hard. 

My biggest restaurant annoyance is stale rice. It's the easiest thing to cook in the world of cuisine, and there is no reason to have stale rice during the busiest hour of a weekday. 

As an added 'bonus', the staff shortchanged me."}
{"text":"Came back here to hang out and have some shisha and I have to say, the people that work here by far provide the best service for a place like this. 

Oh and also I made a mistake, the shisha prices are $13, and $5 for a refill. If you're looking for something to sooth your throat for the long smoking sessions, definitely grab a nice lebonese mint tea (nothing special, just Yellow label tea and mint but it sure is refreshing).

Shwarma's still taste great, they make fresh fruit juice drinks and shakes and they have awesome desserts. I have a feeling I'll be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here. Went here for some sheesha in a group of 5. We also had some fries with garlic dipping sauce and a plate of chicken shawerma. Everything was pretty good. Also had some arabic tea at the end. Service was friendly. Nice place to chill out on a nice summer evening."}
{"text":"The owner is a very dishonest man. One shisha, a cup of coffee and tea, and a bottle of barbican cost us about $38! Just stay away! I frequently walk by this place and 9/10 times there are no customers while this place is still running, HAH!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times.  The food is pretty good.  I've tried the chicken and beef shawarmas as well as the kebabs.  The food was very fresh and very tasty.  The service was quick, which is really important when you're trying to grab a quick lunch.  As others have commented, not a place for sitting, just a quick grab and go (as the name suggests!).  The price for the area is quite reasonable.  I'm certain if you try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The owner hasn't mentioned about price until we pay. When we ask for the bill, 2 drinks and one shisha costed $90. FYI, this is a place you should keep away."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never climbed these steps before in search of Toronto's best shawarma. I popped in here late last night for a handheld snack I could jam into my mouth en route to a concert. Wrap & Grab delivered. The service at the counter was very warm and friendly, and the guys whipped up some hot and fresh falafel balls for our order. I gotta say, I really enjoyed it. The ingredients tasted fresh and the structural integrity was above average.

They also offer chicken, beef, tuna and veggie shawarmas, lunch/dinner plates and salads. There isn't a tonne of seating here, but it's not cramped. And for the amazing prices (three dollar fidy cent per falafel wrap), I will be coming back soon.

Obligatory Title Pun: It's a WRAP! (Bad Pun Police: \"GRAB him!\")

Menu Readability: Imagine Comic Sans, now make it 4.5 times worse.

Need to mention: They're a juice bar too? Apparently they offer juice and smoothies; I'll check it out.

What this place teaches me about myself: That's right officer, I did the pun. And I'd do it again."}
