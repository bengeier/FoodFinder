{"text":"Frankie's has the best food!  I absolutely love their wonton soup. The owners are very nice and welcome You back when You come in. Prices are Good And service is fast. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price!  The customer service is always right on point Jenny has everything on lock down! The Lo mein and the spring rolls are some of the best I have had and the won ton soup is definitely worth a try!  The next time you are in the Brecksville area and have a test for Chinese food give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Very good food served up quickly. Great customer service. This is my go to Chinese comfort food in the area."}
{"text":"I know Chinese food and I'm right with you Jay K. I have no clue what these other people are whining about. I have to laugh at the guy  that says the place is scary. The \"girl\" at the counter understands English very well and is very communicative, always with a smile. Yeah,  it's a small place so take it with you and enjoy the goodness at home or in the park. Never had a problem here in the 25 or so years they've been in business. The large quantities of food they give you is always flavorful and consistent. Never greasy or soggy as others maintain."}
{"text":"I like this place, the food is one of the better Chinese food that ive had and is very convenient for lunch pickup. The owners are very friendly. Lot of variety for being in a small place like Brecksville, OH. This is right by my office, and honestly, a good option for hot & fresh Chinese food. 

Not the most high end place, but a very good option if you are looking for something hot and tasty."}
{"text":"Great flavors, not affraid to showcase Asian spices.  Owners are there everyday and remember your name and what you like as you walk in the door!  Would eat there everyday, but three times a week is what I do!"}
{"text":"Delicious Vegetable Lo Mein and Wonton Soup. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"My go to place for Chinese food.  Good prices and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I only ate here once. Yep there is a sucker born every minute.
Shame on me..."}
{"text":"Good people and pretty good Chinese food. Large portions with fresh ingredients. 

The owners are so friendly and helpful when ordering. Love this place."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Frankie's since they opened. 15 + years!  Food has been consistently good. And affordable"}
{"text":"Love this place been coming here for the whole time they've been open and has always been consistent and very tasty! They don't use msg and they have some healthy options if you're trying to eat clean. Love this place!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall restaurant with OK food. They do have a few tables but the inside of this place feels hot, oppressive and sticky, so I would definitely get take out. Large menu and fast, friendly service. The food is so-so, not awesome but OK, kind of like what'd you get at a mall food court but without the heavy greasiness."}
{"text":"Frankie's is definitely my favorite chinese food place. Beef stir-fry, crab Rangoon, fried rice, egg drop soup, you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is very friendly and are more than willing to substitute or alter the dish to your needs. Definitely should check them out if you're in the mood for some yummy chinese food."}
{"text":"I'd like to give Frankie's 3.5 stars, if I could.  We ordered take out recently - Sesame Chicken, which was excellent...and Shrimp with Snow Peas, which was tasty but really stingy on the shrimp.  Worse, the packaging was somewhat deceptive.  They clearly loaded up the bottom of the container with all veggies and put the four small shrimp at the top - where they were most visible and appearing to be more plentiful than they actually were.  I had to add a couple large  shrimp I had on hand frozen at home to balance out the ratio of shrimp to veggies.

The egg roll was fair, but had an odd, sour, after taste to it.  I'd not get it again.  The crab rangoon was excellent.  As another poster noted, it's not cream cheese with a hint of crab flavoring in it - quite the opposite.

Bottom line - I'd go back again, but would be more than a little leery about my selections.  This is a place where it probably takes a while of ordering many things to learn their 'must haves' versus their 'must nots'."}
{"text":"I live close by and have been getting take out from Frankie's wok pretty much my whole life. Let me tell you...I like most of the menu, but I'll tell you of my favorites.. First is their general Tso's chicken. When your lips first touch the sweet crispy exterior, and your teeth bite down into the soft tender chicken, and that sweet spiciness hits your tongue (I always get it extra spicy...call it genetics) you will realize that all that time you spent in your room \"napping\" as a teenager was a waste, and that you could have been spending time getting to know general Tso instead. And then there's the lo mein noodles... with just the right amount of softness and bounce to these wonderful noodles, soon you will be left questioning your life partner, wondering why you never felt the definition of the words of \"softness and bounce\" in your life before. .. the curry chicken is good too. A cornerstone of downtown Brecksville, Frankie's wok delivers deliviousnestime after time"}
{"text":"It seems like your typical Chinese take out place, but there is so much more to it than familiar looking menu. The two owners are always the ones working. They bring such joy to your day when you are picking up, and are so appreciative of every customer. It's this joy for others that must be the secret behind their amazing food... You eat at enough Chinese take out joints and you can start to tell the difference between a good dish and an average or poor one. Everytime and every order from Frankie's has been excellent. Well cooked, hot, great flavor that just takes a simple meal the extra mile.  In any case our family loves this restaurant and are so thankful for their hard work."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we've had in Ohio and the service was fantastic. We need we found a great place when the phone would not stop ringing with take-out orders"}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup was worth the trip alone! Spicy and very fresh chocked full of yummy mushrooms, pork and scallions. I would have given 5 stars but I was disappointed that they didn't have ice water...only bottled water (I'm cheap!)"}
{"text":"Schrzuan shrimp and orange chicken are the best. Jenny remembers all her regulars. Like family."}
{"text":"Frankie's is one of the few places in the Cleveland area I'll get Chinese food. I love that everything is fresh and well cooked. My favorite is the veggie chow mein which is full of broccoli, cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and water chestnuts. The vegetables are always crunchy and never overly salty. 

There isn't a large dining area (a couple small tables) so it's best if you order things to go. Service is always fast and friendly. 

When in comes to Chinese food in Cleveland Frankie's is one of the best!"}
{"text":"Well. I come from Seattle and really disappointed with my lunch.   I ordered garlic chicken.  It came with white rice and one egg roll.   Garlic chicken was not so tasty, just plain one- chicken was not that real chicken.   Would not come back again."}
{"text":"I love Frankie's. Jenny is so welcoming and always remembers us. The food is good. The prices are awesome. Every city needs a nice place like this where you can get a good meal, quickly and in expensively."}
{"text":"I love this place as a close/quick option to get some Chinese take-out. My favorite meal is the chicken with snowpeas, and I ask for it spicy :]"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area...small inside so best for takeout....husband and wife team that take great pride in cooking and packaging a great meal. Large portions, I always get two meals out of one order.
Frankie's Wok .....A+"}
{"text":"I found this place recently while running a random search on Asian food joint near my office apart from my regular one. They serve some of the best lo mein near my office and the portions are huge. Overall, this is a value for money place. Please be aware that they have limited seating available and are good for take away..."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for a while and have always heard about Frankie's Wok but just have never seen it.  It is actually in the heart of Brecksville--just a location that is easily missed.  My wife and I stopped in for a quick bite the other day.  Only two small tables for dine in so I'm assuming the bulk of their business is takeout.  Inside is a row of pictures of their food but it was so dark that you really couldn't make out much.  Standard chinese fare for the most part.  Unlike fast food chinese or buffets where the food is already prepared ahead of time and they just dish it out to you, Frankie's Wok cooks most of their food to order.  I say most because I will assume the egg rolls and fried rice are likely already done.  The egg rolls were nice and hot so they probably deep fried those fresh.  

Food arrived nice and hot.  Everything tasted fresh.  Plenty of chicken and vegetables in both our dishes.  We left happy.  Will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"One of two Chinese food places in Brecksville, Frankie's Wok is just whyat you th ink it would be. Small, kind of scary but not too bad. The food is okay. It has it's place in the scheme of things. All of the food tastes exactly the same and you don't need to fret too much about the menu. 

Just get something. You're hungry. Soon you'll be home and then it will be over. This is not gourmet fare. This is cheap, moderately clean Chinese food.

You know the drill. Don't strike up a conversation with the girl at the counter while you wait for your food. She has no idea what you're saying."}
{"text":"Yes this place is worthy of five stars.
It is a little hole in the wall, but isn't that were some of the best food comes from?
We ordered six meals and turned the small table into a buffet.
That is the best way to try out a place. 
Everything was delicious.
The owners are nice folks and very friendly.
If I am back in the area, I will stop in again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Jenny and her husband are so welcoming.  It's wonderful to call in your order and be recognized by your voice.  The food is always consistently delicious and hot.  We usually ask for a few special request and they are always accomodating."}
{"text":"Pretty low end Chinese food, with a few exceptions. 

The Seafood Delight was heavy on the cornstarch and filled with really mushy seafood and metallic tasting shrimp. The General Tso's chicken was better-- inoffensive, but lacking any appreciable spice. The dumplings looked homemade, but some were a bit soggy and falling apart. They tasted good if you got a whole one. They were stuffed with spiced ground meat mixture. 

There was one thing that saved lunch. Crab Rangoon usually consists of a fried wonton skin with a dollop of cream cheese that may or may not have something resembling \"crab\" in it. These were wonton skins stuffed with crab which was held together with a little cream cheese. High quality! Who knew? 

If you do decide to order takeout--check your order to make sure they got it right."}
{"text":"Spent a night in Ohio this weekend and found this Chinese restaurant near our hotel. Basically, a very small storefront with a few tables and take out. 
The lady running the show was fantastic - great sense of humor and extremely nice all while keeping a large number of orders organized and going out the door. 
Food was very good and the soups (hot & sour and won ton) were especially good. The hot and sour soup was very spicy, which was appreciated and not the norm. 
The 4 star rating is based on this restaurant as a take out because it is extremely small inside and not really suited to dining in."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful people. A winning combination!"}
