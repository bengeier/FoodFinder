{"text":"The prices for dinner are way too high for what you get, not in terms of quantity but quality. We started with larb that didn't have enough herbs making the larb a bit too greasy with nothing to cut it. We also got the Thai chicken wings and those were OK. For our entrees we had the lad na and pad Thai which were also OK, but we had the massaman and pad prik khing. Both were super salty. Both were remade and were less salty than the first time but still too salty. On top of that, the massaman was more like yellow curry but we lost our appetites when we tasted it again. Even if the food was passable $13-$15  is too much for dinner.  That being said, the server (wish I got his name) was gracious and understanding enough to not charge us for the salty dishes and was very good at explaining spices for our uninitiated guests."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch. Just me and the super nice bartender.  I had the yummy drunken noodles. The food was fresh, tasty and spiced just right.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"New place in downtown Concord- I had dinner there last night and loved it! Staff was friendly and helpful. It was clean and the food was great! I had drunken noodles and the sampler plate for an appetizer!! I can't wait to go back three more times at least and try the  coconut soup (looked delicious!!!) the chicken salad, and the garlic chicken."}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai! I saw a reviewer saying their Pad Thai was \"a shade of brown\".  That is correct, real Pad Thai is BROWN!  If you get red Pad Thai then that means the restaurant is using ketchup instead of tamarind.  Not a joke, they use ketchup at other Thai restaurants.  Not here, I talked with them about their ingredients and I'm happy to say it's authentic and with great technique.   I was impressed that they grow some of their own vegetables. While I'm sure it saves them money it does taste better and even the bean sprouts had a better taste and texture. The prices are a bit high for the portions which brings it at 4 stars for me. The restaurant is clean - I even accidentally dropped my change under the table and it was clean on the floor. Again, kudos on the Pad Thai, awesome authentic flavors that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Pad Thai may seem boring at most Thai joints but this place makes it extra special! The waitstaff is very experienced and knowledgable.      Management changed about a month ago so we'll see if the quality changes."}
{"text":"Went last night during their soft opening.  Place is clean and nicely lit.  Food was delicious: had to get the beef pad Thai (spice 3).  I know it was a basic choice, but if a Thai place can't nail the pad Thai, what hope would there be for the other choices?  Meal came out nicely plated and very colorful.  All the shredded veggies were crisp and so fresh.  Portion was well-sized too.  No draft beer, but they carry OMB bottles.  My waitress was pleasant and apologetic for delay in billing, but it was cool because it was their first night, my beer was cold, and the food was great.  I will definitely return and wish them nothing but the best in their great spot in downtown Concord."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant on six occasions since it opened. The food is absolutely wonderful. With one exception, and the waitress is no longer there, the service has been perfect. My wife and I are huge Tai food fans, and we were excited when this one opened in downtown Concord. I try a new dish every time I go, and my only criticism would be that they could use a few more more veggie-rich dishes. The sauces are magnificent and the Crispy garlic chicken is as good as I've had anywhere. Drown noodles, Red and yellow Curry, cashew chicken! I just haven't had a sub-par dish since my first visit during their soft opening. The decor isn't particularly Tai, more bistro, and I don't mind. I recommend it often, and it is a great little sweet spot on anybody's restaurant tour.  The portions can be a bit too much for one person, but I like taking their food home for later. Prices on entrees are  around $13.00, which isn't bad."}
{"text":"Great place! I moved down to NC from a neighborhood in Chicago with a lot of excellent Thai restaurants. This place is as good as any of them. Best curry I've had in a while. Friendly owners too.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The owner is a true gentleman and spends time explaining dishes to my friends and business associates. I have never had a meal that was less than great. Would like be to see them be in Concord for a long time!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by this restaurant especially given its high rating. The food was decent but the prices were high and they even charged extra for rice which is ridiculous. The curries were served as a soup which I found disappointing as well. Unless you're absolutely dying for Thai food I'd look elsewhere. Given that I was visiting on business I cannot really recommend another Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"First time in Downtown Concord and we had a great lunch here!  Great chicken wing appetizer!  My husband had pork pad see iew and I had tofu pad Thai.  Both were delicious and we even got complimentary soup.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  For only having two tables in the restaurant the food came out a little slow, but not too bad and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first and last time last night.  There was nothing Thai/Asian about the décor or wait staff.  The music was too loud and not appropriate for a Thai restaurant.  Our waitress/bartender was abrupt, not very informative or friendly, and seemed to be in a rush to get rid of us and more interested in tending the bar.  When my husband ordered unsweetened ice tea, she told him \"we don't have any type of tea because there is no room for the urns.\"  Just how long is their soft opening going to continue?!?   The food was okay.  My husband's Garlic Crispy Chicken (just rice and chicken, no veg.) was dry/overcooked,  My small eggplant/shrimp entrée had very little eggplant and a few tiny shrimp.  Two appetizers, two waters, and two entrees, tax, and tip cost about $60.00  The lunch and dinner menus  are almost identical, so be prepared for a pricey lunch bill."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Great taste and preparation. Outstanding service. Get the Drunken Noodles. I got 5 spice. So tasty! Everyone in the party very satisfied!  Will definitely go back when in Concord."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was awesome. My hubby had the steak Thai and it was equally as good! The steak had great flavor and it was juicy. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai around, I've never had a bad meal, and the owner is a great guy! I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Thai or just wants to try something new!! 5 stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I walked in to Mekong Thai Restaurant one evening for dinner. We should have decided to eat elsewhere when we noticed there was only one other couple present.   I have had Thai from several different restaurants in different cities, and this place is by far the worst!  The food is way under salted. The crispy chicken is far from crispy, and tasted as if it was covered in burnt garlic.   We also had the Phad Khing with pork. There was very little pork on the dish. The dish was flavorless and dry   If you ask the waiter to explain the dishes to you, you will sit through a 15 min monologue about how tasty each dish is. (We were left waiting for our check because another Thai novice couple asked for an explanation.)  Also, expect the waitstaff to talk about you within earshot."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, but the 5th star comes from being in Concord where there isn't that much good food available.  My only issue may be that $14 seems a little high for medium sized plate of noodles in Concord.  This place isn't very big and it looks very nice from the outside window, but a little bit more cheaply put together once inside.  That said, the food and service were awesome, and in a place like Concord, that's all I need for 5 stars.  Especially when dining alone, I like to sit at the bar.  Its easier on them to see what you need and normally the service is just normally better in general.  On top of my extremely fast service, I also got to watch some Anthony Bordain on a big screen, which certainly wet my appetite.  At the advice of other yelpers and my bartender, I went with the drunken noodles.  I'd love to tell you the Thai name, but their website is down and I can't look up the menu at the moment.  When asked how spicy 1-5, I asked if 3 would be white guy spicy and they said yeah.  It wasn't that spicy, but I still enjoyed the all of the flavors.  The texture on the noodles were great.  The greens soaked up the sauce and were just amazing.  I liked the chicken, the peppers, and other bits but don't know that they were the star of the dish.  I'm rarely in Concord, but will come back if I'm ever in the area.  Would assume a place like this would have some great lunch specials."}
{"text":"I have only good to talk about this place. Very courteous staff and super tasty food.   Jay, our server, walked us through the menu explaining the dishes in detail. Though we  were in the restaurant a little past their closing time, they did not show even the slightest hint of rush, considering that we were the only guests at that time.  Talking about food- We ordered Wontons (little too oily for us but deep-fried is supposed to be that way), DRUNKEN NOODLES (A MUST!!!)  and Red Curry (super delicious). Be careful with the hotness level. Our food was a 5 and an 8, which was really hot even for our Indian taste buds.   Also, they have so many dishes on their menu that it gets a little tough to make a choice. I am definitely gonna go back for all the dishes that are yet to be tasted."}
{"text":"I have experience lunch and dinner so far at Mekong since it opened.  For lunch for food was good but it was a little slow, and the bartender was over the top.  For dinner the food was great (I did try a different dish) and Jeanne (the bartender that waited on us) was great!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say I had a good experience here like the rest of the reviewers, but I feel like I've wasted my money and time here.  The restaurant itself looks very nice and clean. There were only two tables being waited on so you can guess my server catered to my table 100%. Such a wonderful restaurant, but I'm very disappointed with my food.   I ordered the Chinese brocolli as an appetizer, and it taste like it was tossed in oyster sauce, nothing special. It was def not worth $11. I think the Thai steak could have been good if it wasn't well-done. Actually, I'm not sure if it was well-done or not; the whole steak was dry, even the pinker parts were dry. The only thing I enjoyed was my basil and ,mint drink."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a true hidden gem, and one of my absolute favorites. It's quiet atmosphere and candle lighting on each table make for a very intimate dinner experience. Jay is super friendly and makes great recommendations. This place is very vegetarian friendly for non-meat eaters like me and you can tweak the meals just how you like them. Don't be afraid to wait 30-40 minutes for your dinner - tasteful and made-to-order food takes time and it's worth it!   The sampler is a great way to taste a few of the appetizers - the crab wontons and cabbage egg rolls are amazing. I'm big into Pad Thai as well (I order it at most Thai/Japanese restaurants so I have a lot to compare) and the Vegetable Pad Thai here is by far one of my favorites! It's super light, not doused in sauce and plenty of crispy vegetables to fill you up.  I love introducing new people to this place!"}
{"text":"Thai food at its finest! A shrimp egg roll appetizer with a sweet chili sauce.   Pad Thai was an excellent lunch portion and spiced just the way I asked!"}
{"text":"We recently tried Mekong after hearing so-so reviews. The staff was very pleasant and eager to tell us all about their menu.     We started off with the Spring Rolls which were very delicious and I highly recommend them. Next time I would like to try their deep fried version but we've been on a health kick lately.      I ordered the Drunken Noodles (phad kee moa) with Tofu and my fiancé ordered the Red Curry dish. I've never had Drunken Noodles before but these were rather tasty. The sauce was thick enough without being greasy and the tofu was cooked perfectly which is hard to find in these parts. My fiancé loved the Red Curry. The sauce was a great consistency (I've had the watered down version at other places).      They also have a pretty good selection of beers (OMB Copper and NoDa Brewery).     Overall, I'd definitely give this place a shot. Kinda pricey for the area but also no competition around."}
{"text":"Excellent food and Great service! Fresh food and lots of choices. Prices are very  reasobably. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Went to get a take out of drunken noodles and chicken wings. The young lady at the counter was courteous and made sure my order was right and good to go. Clean establishment"}
{"text":"I ordered to go: The food is good BUT for the price??? $13 for Pad Thai and the container wasn't even full?? (back home in the Bay Area $7 would have fed 3 with leftovers.) I spent over $60 dollars in Thai food and the best thing was Green curry chicken($13) which had more sauce then meat or veggies. Maybe I wouldn't be so disappointed if I couldn't make it myself or knew how much it really cost to make. The ingredients are not hard to come by. I understand Thai food may be considered a novelty here but pricing could be way better."}
{"text":"Unfortunately there are times when you go back to a restaurant and the quality changes. This is one of those times. We just went back to Mekong and the menu has changed and the wonderful dishes that we had over a year ago (if still available) did not taste the same.   The service was horrible and I think the friendly chef / owner guy is gone. What a shame."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, but it is kind of expensive. They do takeout, but I would suggest only eating in here because the take out portions are slightly smaller than what they give you in the restaurant. The shrimp fried rice is my favorite dish.  Nice atmosphere, nice servers. I've been here many times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Can there be a less than one star? The owner, Sam, is a genuine ass.  I don't know how to state that in a nicer way. He is disrespectful, condescending, and has really changed the atmosphere of that business.   It's a shame.   All Thai food is not created equally."}
{"text":"Have only been twice, but so far so good.  Still \"new\" so still working a bit to get into the groove, but that said, good food and nice servers.   Once ate with large group, another time with just my daughter and me at the bar.  Very accommodating, and they really try to customize your order as you  need it.  Delicious food.  I'll go back, but may wait a bit for that groove to settle in so we get faster service."}
{"text":"It's so fantastic to have a great Thai place in downtown!  I've had several things on the menu and have enjoyed it all.  We love Jeannie...she is funny, makes great suggestions and is fast.  Love the drink menu too, great selection of beers, wines, and hand made cocktails.  Don't miss the cranberry margarita!  Living in downtown, my husband and I really enjoy being able to walk to a place with great food and also reasonable prices.   I also love that you can adjust the spice level to your taste.  Keep up the great work Jay and team!"}
{"text":"Placed an order online through eat24. Went to go pick it up and they said it would be out in a few. I'm pretty sure they didn't get the order online and had to go back and cook it. We had to wait at least 20 mins at the bar--I assumed they would have offered us a glass of wine while we wait but they seem short staffed.  Onto the food-- I got pad see ew with chicken and it was pretty bland. The noddles were dry and the chicken was even drier. Didn't seem as if they were cooked together, it was lacking that delicious flavor and spice I normally like from pad see ew done right.  However, I will definitely be back because I think they deserve another chance, also the restaurant is so intimate that it's perfect for date night and I love supporting local restaurants."}
{"text":"Hands down the best curry I've ever had. I am so glad we found this place. The owner is super friendly too."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Thai is authentic as I remember it. Staff is friendly and helpful. Red Thai Curry is my wonderful!"}
{"text":"The food in this restaurant is fantastic! We came here late one evening after a long road trip, dying for some great Thai food and we were not disappointed. The owner was very nice and explained the hotness of dishes to us. As vegetarians, we absolutely loved that we were able to choose any curry we wanted (and a number of other dishes) with tofu and veggies.  My husband got the red curry and I got the Asian Eggplant and both were absolutely delicious. I don't usually finish my plates (light eater), but I did here because I just couldn't stop, it was so delicious. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food that I have found in Charlotte, and the Pad Thai isn't Red!! Only since moving down south have I seen red pad Thai!! Portions are small, but very tasty! I will return!"}
{"text":"The food is not Thai but more like Chinese.  Plum sauce with spring rolls and no peanut sauce with chicken satay.  Fortunately we just stopped in for an appetizer.  Atmosphere pleasant and host was very nice. They have a full bar.  Food, however, was below average.  I would not return."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner tonight.  Arrived at 10:15 and can only say great things about this place!  Excellent food, nice atmosphere (loved the music & candle lighting) & over the top service!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Mekong since they first opened. I've always enjoyed the food, but gradually the portion size has progressively gotten smaller and smaller, ESPECIALLY if you're getting takeout.   My wife brought me the Massaman Curry home for dinner tonight, and I'd have guessed it was off the lunch menu instead of the dinner. The curry itself came in a quart container, but was filled maybe halfway, and they gave me about a half cup of white rice to go with it. All that for $15.  I've got no complaints about the quality of the food itself, but be prepared to pay the same amount you would at a comparable Thai restaurant for half the portion size.   Definitely the place to go if you're not that hungry, and aren't concerned about spending over $60 for a family of four."}
{"text":"The Pho is amazing and the Larb is awesome too. The service was spot on and really friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very few times have I ever walked out of a restaurant, but the service was so atrocious. We watch three other tables get their orders before us. They had lost our order and had basically ignored us. Which is a huge accomplishment considering the restaurant is Tiny and we were sitting in the middle of it. I wish I could have got to taste their food but after waiting for 45 minutes that was not going to happen. The hostess was more bent on refilling water than fit refilling our drinks. The only smart thing they did was comp the 2 drinks we did have."}
{"text":"So my wife and I went to Mekong based on the reviews.  Boy was that a mistake. I live in Concord and I want to give Mekong a second chance so I hope the owner will respond to this review. We walked in on a Saturday night, medium size crowd. I see a male and a female that work there and both seemed disappointed to see us walk in. I thought, \" boy that's weird\" .  Later I learned why. They were totally overwhelmed. We sat at the bar because It was a \"30 minute wait\". Strange because there were plenty of tables available. So we sat at the bar and no one ask us if we would like anything so I asked for a beer after ten minutes. So we waited and waited and it was clear from the other customers in the restaurant who weren't happy that we better take our business elsewhere before our night was ruined. So after 45 minutes of sitting at the bar and being ignored i called Gianni's Trattoria a few doors down and she said they had a table available. We were greeted with fabulous hospitality. I knew right away that we had found the right place. I'm not reviewing Gianni's but I'll just say this, you need to go. Fabulous staff, owner and food. Again I encourage the owner of Mekong to respond because I am a neighbor and I love Thai food but I was very disappointed. As a side note I asked the girl working at Mekong twice \"is this normal?\" I was surprised that she basically had the attitude of it is what it is. And when I said \"I'll pay for my beer now we are going somewhere else'. There was no apology whatsoever. She just took my money and that was that."}
{"text":"Waiter was very helpful in explaining the different dishes to those with our party who were not as familiar with thai flavors. Food was delicious. Service was good. Hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after noticing it while driving by a few weeks ago.  Walked in and was greeted promptly by the lady owner.  She sat us down at a booth and walked off.  Came back a minute later with 3 glasses of iced water and walked off again.  I can understand if they were slammed pack with customers but there were only 5 tables occupied including ours.    Somehow or another, we waited for about 10 minutes.....still NO MENUS nor drinks (besides the water).  I noticed she looked over at our booth a few times, yet DID NOT even bother to come check on us.  The other waiter walked by us and began taking orders from the other customers in the next booth (that came in after we did).  That was the last straw.  We got up and left.  WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS CRAP HOLE."}
{"text":"We loved jeannie our waitress. We were very satisfied with our meals and would recommend everyone to come here."}
{"text":"Just had a huge family dinner with some amazing dishes. All the food was spectacular and the owner is always kind and helpful. Would recommend this to anyone looking to try Thai food in the concord area."}
{"text":"Food, service, value, atmosphere...wine and drink selection were a pleasant surprise. We will return! Thanks"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I live in Historic Concord and frequently stop by for lunch/dinner. Also the bar can be open late on certain nights and gets really fun."}
{"text":"Well we ended up here pretty late on a Saturday night and were very happy to find it was still open AND HAD KARAOKE!  We enjoyed everything we ordered and Jay could not have been more accommodating.  It was a blast and we will be coming back for regular meals in addition to bringing friends back to sing and laugh.  I think I've read that karaoke starts at 10 pm on weekends but am not sure."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Thai in North Carolina. A little expensive for the amount of food. But so good it's worth it"}
{"text":"Our dinner was really good. Pad Thai was spicy and not sweet! Balance of flavors was perfect. Including the spice level, I usually order level 3, but Jay convinced me to select level 2, and he was spot on. Slow burn after finishing the dish but not a sweaty nose :) we will be back!"}
{"text":"I just got take out from here.  The food was fast and moderately priced.  When I got home the pad thai was a shade of brown and tasted like it had been sitting in oil all day.  The panang curry did not taste like any panang I have ever had.  I'm pretty sure they just made red curry.  It was also sour and tasted more lkke vinegar than anything.  The only good dish I had was the tom yum.  I will not go back.  The quality isn't there.  I would recommend people to skip over this place."}
{"text":"I had the Phad Khing for lunch. It was delicious and they even gave me rice when I asked for it even though it came with noodles. Jay is very friendly and professional. Great place for a quiet lunch or dinner.  I'd love to see more lunch specials around $7-9 on the menu.  We'll definitely be back for a quiet dinner sometime soon.  Keep up the great work! Bob P."}
{"text":"Support your local business.  Went to the newly opened Mekong Thai restaurant & Bar for dinner last night to celebrate our 27th anniversary. The food was fantastic. The wait staff (Jeannie?) was fast, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. We started with a Sampler platter. Best Crab Rangoons ever. The wonton was delicate but the filling was substantial. I also had the 5 spice drink with rum and  it  was delicious. Could have used a bit more alcohol for the price but still, it tasted so good.  5 spice and rum is a great combination. Why haven't I thought of that before? I had the Yakisoba with Shrimp which were cooked to perfection. The broccoli was nice and crisp and the noodles were better than your average lo mein noodles just as our waitress advised. My husband had the Red Curried Duck. The duck was tender and the sauce was very flavorful. After you choose your entree, you get to choose the degree of spicy (hotness) you want from 1-5. I chose 1 because I don't like spicy and I was breaking a sweat so be forewarned! I can't imagine what 5 would do. Definitely look forward to returning and trying more adventurous dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place if it was staffed. I've been several times and food is very very good with a good vibe. The wait times are all over the place. We left the last time we went due to no one to wait on us. Food is great, hate to leave a negative review on a downtown Concord restaurant. I work in the downtown area."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant hands down. Love coming here, I always get a curry and they are perfect. Not too spicy but not mild, nice seasonings never bland. The owner is always so pleasant and attentive since he runs the entire front of house. We always look forward to coming here for a Thai treat!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and great vegetarian choices. Veggie roll was fresh. The chicken larb was a classic and fun to eat by hand.   I've talked to others who agree this is a gem of a place in Concord and just about to catch on.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Concord, but now live in Texas. I love unique, fresh, delicious food, and sometimes feel my options are lacking when I visit home. Typically, my husband and I just drive into Charlotte for date night.  This restaurant is a hidden gem...except, it isn't so hidden, it's on Union Street! My parents live here, and had never even noticed it (nor heard of it). I spotted the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.   The atmosphere was kind of dark, but romantic, with Christmas music, low lighting and candles on the tables. I went with a friend, but we had fun!   I have not eaten much Thai, so the server went through the entire menu, explaining their most popular items. I am gluten-sensitive (not allergic, just careful) and he explained that 90% of the menu is gluten-free. After his introduction to the menu, we ordered easily.   On the appetizer sampler, I tried everything, but the petite rolls were the best. Next time, I'll skip the sampler and just order those!   I ordered the Pad Thai Moa, I think?? Anyway, it was SO spicy, I couldn't eat it (even though I picked the 1 spice level!). The server took it to the back and had the cook add extra noodles, which reduced the spice level by half. It was awesome, then. Everything was delicious and fresh!! The rice noodles were amazing.   Next time I'm in town, this will be my designated date night place. You don't have to drive to Charlotte for unique, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Went here for my anniversary dinner with my husband and daughter it was nice our food came quickly and the staff was friendly. Definitely would come back and tell my friends to visit. Oh and the best part of all are their prices 3 meals for 50$ was not bad at all and for the quality of food it was a steal."}
{"text":"Finally, a good and authentic Thai restaurant in Concord and a force not be reckoned with. We ordered the Phad Kee Moa and Garlic Garlic for lunch and it was amazing. The spiciness level ranges from 1-5, I chose a 3 and that was just the right amount of spicy. They make all their sauces in house and you can just tell that it's authentic. Ambience and presentation were fantastic too, And the staff were very friendly, I definitely recommend and will be returning."}
