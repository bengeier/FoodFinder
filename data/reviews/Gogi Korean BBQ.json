{"text":"Ok disclaimer, the food here is pretty good.. Like 4 stars good. I would even say it's my go to Korean restaurant here in calgary. We were craving Korean tonight so of course we decided to come here. We knew it closed at 10 so we walked in the door by 9pm. To our disappointment we were turned away by staff saying they were closed. I politely pointed out to the staff that the open sign was still on so it was misleading. He proceeded to correct me saying the open sign was off. I walked outside and there it was, a bright ass sign saying \"open\" with the hours printed underneath (sign said 10 btw). I understand restaurants closing 30 minutes early if they're slow but a whole hour? That seems pretty unreasonable."}
{"text":"They now have two types of all you can eat. I have tried both. 23.95 is the basic buffet which includes unlimited meat, side dishes, and refills on drinks. The 28.95 buffet comes with everything that the basic comes with plus two more dishes and ice cream. It is not cheapest buffet, but if you think about the amount of meat you get - it makes sense!

The bulgogi (chicken & beef) are amazing! very tasty but also very spicy. The meat is so delicious. The deep fried chicken is also really good. I went with my family this weekend and we must have had 3 plates of it because we couldn't get enough. The side dishes included kimchi in it. 

I would say the decor is fairly simple but not bad. The outside of the restaurant is not at all impressive, but I came for the food. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good here, just a few complaints! We came during the day on a Sunday and it was not at all busy, so our waiter was very attentive. She quickly serviced our table with rice, meat, and drinks whenever it was necessary. I'm a big fan of the dalgangjeon fried chicken - almost ate two servings by myself! Atmosphere is OK. We ate here in a small group and one of us went to the woman's bathroom only to see an entire windex in the toilet - plastic bottle and all! Very random and probably a one-time problem, but how did the workers totally not notice the entire time we were there?"}
{"text":"Awesome Korean BBQ! I came here for a birthday dinner, there were 12 of us total. Service was great, food exceptional - I will be back!"}
{"text":"#171

I am on fire today. No, I am off from work and hungry. Add to that, it is family dinner with the only white person in a family of eight Chinese. They take care of me better than my own family so for them, I will do anything.

Everyone is here and ready for this buffet or are they?

I heard a rumour there is no Hite Beer but there is soju (that is why I deducted one star so now only four are possible; if I, as a white person, I can bother to learn about your culture, you need to bring it). They do have Cass Beer but the soju could make up for this temporarily.

Now, on with the buffet (to be regular or deluxe), now this is a pickle (non-fried). The difference is that regular has mat-tang and the deluxe has la gal bi and gam-ja-tang (they both have eight common items including dduk-bok-kki, dalgangjeong, chicken bulgogi, bulgogi, deoji bulgogi, samgyeop-sal, kim-mar-i, and jap-chae). Both versions come unlimited side dishes, rice, and soft drinks while the deluxe also comes with ice cream.

Regular it shall be or is it. Maybe a set dinner for 6-7 for $135 (since there are three children).

Decisions.. decisions... Set dinner it is. The set dinner does include my favourites beef and chicken bulgogi, marinated short ribs, and seafood pancakes. Add an order of cold buckwheat noodles for each kid and we're done.

As others have mentioned, the service is suspect but for Canada, almost normal (I know, my standards are too high).

The restaurant is clean as was was the (men's) washroom (single person so lock the door). No hot water in the sink is a little off-putting especially in the winter. Well lit and Korean music playing in the background. I guess to hear Wheesung is asking a bit. Was hoping to catch a K-drama on the TV.

Get Hite Beer and I'll bump you up to 4 stars (4.5 stars if I had the option).

The food IS good so that (other the beer issue) makes up for everything else."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Korean restaurant in the NW!! 

My husband and I had their AYCE on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't busy. We went when they had their $25/person promotion (regularly $28.95/p) in November. Our server was the manager and he was super friendly and interactive. Since they ran out of short ribs the night before, he lowered the price to $20/p for us. 

We tried everything on the menu - spicy chicken, spicy pork, deep-fried seaweed, japchae, pork belly, pork bone soup, rice cakes! The japchae was delicious but the rice cakes were kinda dry, as if they were sitting out too long. The manager cooked everything for us at the table since it wasn't too busy. The pork belly was fresh and so were all the marinated meats. 

The service was amazing and the manager told us stories of how he arrived in Canada less than 10 years ago, fell in love with the country and decided to open a Korean restaurant. He checked on us every 5 minutes and made sure we got to try everything on the menu. They also do lunch combos for a decent price (~ $13).

Overall we were really impressed with the service and the food. We were so full, we skipped dinner but we will definitely return again for more delicious noms."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I've been here twice and both times were terrible. The service sucks so badly. The first time I came to Gogi was on a weekday night.  it wasn't busy yet it took probably 30-45 mins for any food to come out. That included the rare meat I had to cook also. Whenever something was ordered, it was missed and I continuously had to re order everything. The food isn't as bad as the service. If they served amazing Korean barbecue.. I still wouldn't even come here because of the service. This happened the second time as well. Now only during the second time, the servers were too busy cleaning tables to get out early at the end of the day that they also missed my order. I have nothing great to say about this place."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Gogi was when they had a discount on their lunch and dinner menu. We decided to try them out as they were newly setup at that time and were trying to get customers with their discounts on their Facebook page.

We looked at their menu before coming and saw that they sold Tangsuyuk which was my fiance's favorite Korean-Chinese dish, so for sure we were going there to try it out!

As we arrived at Gogi, we were seated right away and had our orders taken. Then after 5 minutes or so another group came and they got their orders taken as well. As we were still waiting on our waters and tea we noticed that the group that just came got it before we did. It took about 10 more minutes before our server realized that we still had no cutlery, water, and tea. And the only reason why he noticed this was because he has to come back to our table to let us know that they were out of Tangsuyuk.  

This suprised us as the restaurant was not busy at all and we came in as soon as they opened for lunch. So we ended up ordering Kalbi instead. Which is not too bad.

We ordered kalbi, dumplings, and chicken wings. The food was pretty good and we were satisfied as well. 

Fast forward 2 months later - our office decided to order from them as I recommended Gogi for lunch. We order 5 lunch \"bentos\" and itlleverything was delivered on time. My co-workers did not like their lunches at all. Most of them complained that their food was cold, and underseasoned(Mine was the same). I felt bad recommending Gogi as my office decided never to order from them.

So, overall - I recommend Gogi if you are dinning in for lunch, but do not order take out as their take out is not consistent with their dine in. I probably would not go back as I didn't find anything special on their menu that justifies a comeback."}
