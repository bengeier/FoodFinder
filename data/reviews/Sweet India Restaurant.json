{"text":"Great food at a very fair price. Butter chicken was some of the best i have had in Toronto. Will be back often."}
{"text":"Best butter chicken in the city, hands down.  Not much spice but the actual flavor is fantastic.   The thali, naan, saag paneer, chana dishes are always great as well. The lassi drinks are always fresh too. Relatively fresh desserts also made on-site.   Always fresh, never dissatisfies, fairly priced. This is a small, family business and after trying to convince the owner to open a more central location after being 30yrs in business... His answer was still \"no, thank you\".  I've been to many Indian/Pakistani restaurants in the GTA over the last 12 years and only one other has come close to the quality of food. This place though, for the price never disappoints and I drive 40km to get there!   Other, more high-end restaurants that have been rated as 4 star on yelp don't even come close (such as Curry Twist)."}
{"text":"The Food is good but the quantity is really leaning on the cheap side in my opinion. The butter chicken with rice is an appetizer add a bottle of water your paying 9 bucks and your leaving feeling empty. You may have had a good tasting lunch but the portion is way to small. Kids Meal to be exact.  Your welcome"}
{"text":"Takeaway (see pictures)  I Ordered:  - Goat biryani ($5.29). Taste was good, a bit too oily but what really disappointed me was the amount of meat. It was like they had taken one boti (morsel of meat) and sliced it into small slices.  4/10  Message to management.  If you have run out a food item, just be honest and say so and the customer can order something else..its better than getting a bad review like this.  - Sweet ($4.80) was nice, I got the smallest box. kalakan, barfi, gulab jamun, motichoor ladu. 7/10  - Samosa (2 for $1): no onion, just potato and peas and spices, which is how I like it. It was good, pastry was a little thick.  6/10. I prefer the samosa from Brar's in Etobicoke.   Ambience: Clean venue. Nice packaging if you order takeout. The old location which is just steps away is still open.  Note at the time when I went, they did not have a menu so I had to ask at the cashier what items they had. Hopefully they will have this rectified very soon.  Parking: Free plaza parking just outside."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The sweets are great, but the meals here take FOREVER, and are always not cooked properly. I ordered the butter chicken and it was ice cold in the middle. Chicken Pakora was beyond greasy. Its ok, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Always epic butter chicken. Go half and half so you get both rice and naan. All entrees are just so good. Excellent value for your dollar."}
{"text":"This place is so good and cheap. I spent $30 and came out with so much food. It was enough to feed me and my bf twice! Service is quick and friendly. My only complaint was that the chicken biryani had too many little bones in it."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Ontario for Caribana and wanted a place to eat some food. We finally locate Sweetindia and we weren't disappointed. We tried the curried-goat with roti. It was delicious and very tastie. The owner was very attentive and caring. We were satisfied."}
{"text":"Took a medium tray of butter chicken to work potlucks a few times and colleagues were fighting over who got to take home the remaining sauce. My wife is a fan of their samosas and channa bhatura as well. Great place that's been in the same spot for over 20 years. They've recently renovated, and they now have a larger display of all their sweets - which is a good thing and a bad thing; because once you spot something you want to buy, you're really tempted to buy everything else in sight."}
{"text":"Let's get this straight: you are not coming here for the ambiance. Unless what you're looking for is pastel pink walls, hard swivelling plastic chairs that haven't been seen since before McDonald's had the Hamburgler, and Styrofoam plates.  You're coming here for the food. And it's worth it.  No matter what you order, the food is flavourful. And for the price, the portions are right. Food takes about 15 minutes to come out, but for a delicious meal, the wait is nothing.  Either jump right in and try something from each of their menus (vegetarian and meat) or choose one of their meal combos to start. And take some of their typical baked goods home to try. I don't know what any of those deserts are called, but I do know that some of them are tasty."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food at a fast food price! Even cheaper than MacDonald's! Taste is better than any Indian restaurant in downtown I've tried. And the price is almost half of what you usually pay... Their sweets are also excellent. Khoya was superb!"}
{"text":"Not fancy, but quite tasty. I didn't care for the daal, but I ended up with so much food it didn't really matter.  The dessert selection is out of control and I look forward to working my way through it all."}
{"text":"I love Sweet India! Been coming by this place for nearly 20 years!!! I grew up on their samosas, puri's, burfi's, and gulab jamins. Tons of memories! At $7/lb for most of their sweets, they are cheaper than some of the other establishments like Kwality Sweets (near Steeles/Airport Road). Yes, the interior is simplistic as M.K. Gandhi would have liked it, but the food is rich with colour and taste. Go for the samosas (at ~70 cents a piece, they are a steal!) and you have to try their puri's with channa, then leave with your taste buds satisfied with something sweet. Oh Sweet India, I lurve thee."}
{"text":"I've been going since 1997. I hadn't been for a couple of years but decided to drive out to the place. I was very impressed with the renovation and the selection. It's amazing the selection of foods available, cleanliness and quality.   I don't typically order meat dishes as the vegetarian selections are great. They make great chic peas (chole/channa), saag and aloo gobhi. My wife ordered a chicken biriyani and enjoyed it as well.   Speaking to the owner he mentioned that they cook fresh food daily. After going to other restaurants I would have to agree as the food is always well made.   A must go if you crave Indian food."}
{"text":"The quality of food is worth the price. Have got the food packed multiple times and had taken their as well. Chana Bhature is worth trying. Also the chicken quality is good there"}
{"text":"Love visiting this restaurant my husband got me hooked. I love ordering their butter chicken with a side of rice and yogurt and fresh Naan. The location doesn't look very nice but they are renovating to a better location just a few door down can't wait to see what it looks like. Definitely my fave Indian food restaurant!"}
{"text":"No matter what day of the week, or what time of the day you come in to eat, you get the best, highest quality, and least expensive Indian food in the GTA.   I've been coming here for years, and their food is consistently delicious every time.  Their butter chicken is one of the best and creamiest I've had, and I travel the world and I can tell you this one is to die for. They have samosas that are mouth watering, and will even sell you frozen ones for you to bring home at a very reasonable price.   After being established in Malton for the last 30 ish years, they are renovating their establishment to accommodate more people and be more technologically advanced.    The owner has become a good friend over the last 6 years of me coming here, and there is not another place that I would ever recommend more than here.  Sweet India represents Indian food at its best."}
{"text":"Dropped by Sweet India on a whim. The upgraded branding was clean and very well done as was the decor. We ordered two thalis with the two meat and one veggie selection platter. Both platters had butter chicken and goat curries as the meat selections. This is where it kind of went down hill...For the price we paid up front the portion size was minuscule! The server carefully laid out two tiny slivers of chicken in the butter chicken gravy as well as two slivers of goat meat in the goat curry. When I asked to add another piece, the server replied, \"Oh I've given plenty, that's all that comes with this.\" I've visited plenty of mom and pop based Indian and Middle Eastern eateries and they've always accommodated. The gall of this server was unexpected. Overhearing our conversation and as the next platter was being prepared by the second server, she was nice enough to add a few extra pieces of meat to the already scarce platter. The food was tasty for the most part but the service left a bad taste in our mouth. The place serves takeout services for samosas, sweets and other savouries - we had plans of picking a few items up. However with the hefty bill we paid for the tiny morsels of food. It just wasn't worth it. We'll be avoiding this place."}
{"text":"This place has good consistency of their food and the quality it amazing. This is why they're always super busy, so call ahead to place your order!  Thali:  The butter chicken thali comes with butter chicken, rice, one mixed vegetable, yogurt, onions dipped in green chutney and a bhatura/naan for about $7.   Paneer Pokora:  Great Texture, not so oily, a bit spicy and comes with a red sweet and sour sauce. $7.49 for a pound I believe.   Chana Bhatura:  Tastes like any other Indian place."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of disaster... I usually NEVER go to Indian restaurants because they cheap out on everything so you know that theyre going to give you cr@p quality food, but i went here one day to get samosas... If you like surprises with your order, then I would totally recommend Sweet India... Especially if the surprise belongs in the Insect Exhibit at the Science centre, because I swear to you there was a cockroach inside THE DAMN SAMOSA! When I confronted the owner he offered me a free meal?! Im like you honestly think im going to eat here again? Did the health inspection agency skip its visits to airport road for the past decade? how is this establishment still in business?"}
{"text":"Inexpensive tasty Indian food.  It's a  counter and cafeteria try type of place but great food at a great price."}
{"text":"I went here with friends for lunch last week and it was packed!  They are in the midst of moving back to their original location so they are temporarily located in another place, so that accounted for the tight squeeze. However the lineup was well deserved as the food here was delicious!   I think next time I go here, and I will be back, I will call and order ahead especially if it during the lunch hour. Overall delicious finger licking good food!"}
{"text":"I live in Brampton, where there are many Indian food joints.  I have to go all the way to Malton for Sweet India's Shahi Paneer and Butter Chicken, because I haven't yet found a place in Brampton that makes them as good.  Both have the same rich curry sauce. Shahi Paneer is even more richer than Butter Chicken with the bits of cheese.  Their Channa Bhatura is also very good."}
{"text":"This is a good casual restaurant for Indian food and reasonably priced.  Nothing fancy, but decent menu selection."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely fantastic! The good is delicious. The price is great ... I had butter chicken and  garlic naan to eat. The meat was tender and we'll cooked. I enjoyed a fresh mango lassi to drink; although rich it was probably one of the best I've ever had. For dessert I had their amazing rasmali.  It was fantastic! I can't say enough about this tiny gem. Sweet India has been around forever. ... I remember being in uni and driving back just to get a fix of their food. Spectacular. Plus if you call ahead they will cater to pretty much any request . Great service and great food."}
{"text":"Not sure what's so great about this place... it was pretty average.  The parathas and naans were good.  The shahi paneer was awful.."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" place for Indian food, and bonus for me it's close to my work!  Everything on their menu is delicious.  Very reasonably priced, good portion size.  I normally get the Butter Chicken Thali, mmnnn..... They also have a large variety of sweets, oh and don't forget to get some veggie samosas to go!"}
{"text":"Not clean. The staff is very slow and rude. I'm not going there ever again! We waited for our veg thali for about 40 minutes even though the curries and all were ready. I saw that staff were not using gloves and washrooms were not clean!"}
{"text":"Butter Chicken for just around $5 is the lunch special on Friday. it's the best! (I even go there after work to bring it home for Dinner.) fast service, great food, low low prices: for $4 to $5 you can get rice and a bhatura, pickled onion, and a main (meat or veg) which sure to fill you up.  (instead of getting fast food and paying $7 to $8 and filled up with soft drinks.)  I love the Mix-Veg, or Aloo-Gobi as my main dish, you won't miss the meat. if you are meat eater, butter chicken, or the goat curry would be a great dish to try."}
{"text":"It's easy to find inexpensive Indian food in Brampton, but to find inexpensive and good tasting/high quality can be a challenge. For less than $10 at Sweet India you get a choice of 2 different meats, 1 vegetable, rice, naan bread, desert and a drink! Talk about getting a bang for your buck.  I had the meat thali with butter chicken, tikka masala chicken and chick peas (Chana). Everything was great, but the butter chicken stood out. It was creamy, not overly sweet, tender and just plain delicious.   It's not a fancy place, but for a cheap and tasty meal- this is a great option!"}
{"text":"Sweet sassy molassy!   This place is DELICIOUS. I came in and had the eggplant and potato with rice (tragically, I can't have the bhatura since it has dairy in it). At first I was a little annoyed with the price, seeing that the other veggie combo is less than $5 (mine was $6.90), but then I got it and realized that this was going to be a two-meal deal for me.   The curry, amazing. The eggplant was just perfect and the rice was springy. The onion salad that came with it was spicy and tasty, but kind of ruined my breath for the rest of the day.  Note for spice lovers: there is a bowl of green chilis for the taking where you get forks, knives, spoons and water.   The atmosphere is fine. It's McDonald's like seating (well, before McDonald's big revamp), but the bathrooms in the basement were not in the best shape.  There is also a great bake shop in there with a lot of pastries that I was too stuffed to try.   Next time I'm dropping someone off at the airport, I am taking them here first!!"}
{"text":"MUST TRY THEIR BUTTER CHICKEN (with the roti or naan)!!! this dish right here gets an effen ***** (don't count, it's FIVE STARS) soooo damn good, no other butter chicken will ever compare.   Let me just explain to you how good it really is, I don't ever eat alone....but i did EAT ALONE AND ATE THERE VERY PROUDLY without a care in the world. lol not only do i order one for there, i order one for take out....i eat it BACK TO BACK :)   Only reason why it doesn't get five stars from me is simply because this place is ghetto lol (for those who don't know what that means, it's a bit outdated and small) but it doesn't even matter how it looks....they're always busy...so glad i found this little hidden jem"}
{"text":"The quality of the food was ok. However, I am very disappointed in the fact the Butter Chicken Combo is advertised at $9.79 which includes a beverage. However, they charge you extra for the beverage. When it was questioned they refused to update or refund. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a place I visit often. Delicious Indian food that tastes like home and reasonable prices. Their sweets are a lovely way to end a meal I recommend the \"milk cake\". I've enjoyed the channa bhatura, butter chicken, roti, chat papri, paneer dishes and all are yummy. The service is good. Don't be fooled by the appearance of this place. I do wish they would stop using styrofoam plates and cups as this hurts our environment."}
{"text":"I make the drive to eat here. Strong authentic flavours is why I go. Only problem is too few seats. Otherwise, I'll continue to be a repeat customer.  Oh ya, the carrot based sweets are my favourite, they are really good here."}
{"text":"I've only had take out from here and while I live closer to Kwality and Tandoori Flame Sweet India is now our go to place for picking up snacks and meals, especially their samosa's which are less oily and tastier than some of the other Indian resto's around here (and certainly compared to most in the downtown area).   Their curry too is very well done and I'm a fan of their biriyani and prices are hard to beat. Sweet India does not look like much inside or outside but things like that matter little since they are able to dish out some mean meals. While Kwality seems to have the better variety of Indian sweets, the one time I bought sweets from here, they were a big hit with my family and our guests.   Not much else to say here, it wouldn't be a location I would come in for a sit down meal since seating is sparse and not very welcoming, but that's not a big deal for me since I don't live too far from here."}
{"text":"We went there last week omg!!i loved the fresh baked nan breads..ohh the spice was good i realy like their bar b que platter.yummy"}
{"text":"Stopped by since the renovation.  The current set-up is cleaner and nicer.  There is a wide assortment of Indian sweets.  My dad's favourite are jelabies which you can buy by the piece or by weight.    I was there for the butter chicken meal.  You get a half portion of rice and a bhatura.  Not bad but I have found that since the renovations the prices have spiked.  So rather than $7.00 it is closer to $9.00 Plus tax.    The real deal are the samosas.  Three for a dollar and they are great fresh.    The place offers sit down table service too.  However, I find the girls behind the counter to be a little slow.  However, if you have a craving for Indian both meat or vegetarian then Sweet India has something for you."}
{"text":"Wow...what a gem of a little place.   For true authentic Indian food - this is most certainly the place !   That being said, we certainly do not come to Sweet India for the decor that is for sure - but for lunch this place is awesome for Indian Curries like wonderful melt in your mouth Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala and the Curry goat is really wonderful. So many great flavours and they have about 30other Indian dishes as well.....a large menu really.  Seats about 15 people in what was I think an old Mr. Subway - the food is out of this world. The menu is on the board behind the owner and I've been here about 20 times and still don't know how to order properly.....The butter chicken with rice and nann is great with little spicy onions you can put on - you can order mild or if you like Indian heat, order as you want it.  The price is really really affordable.....  The samosa's and savoury snacks are really good - love the vegetable pakora with the very flavourful dipping sauce.   They have a wonderful display of Indian sweets too - have bought these a couple time to take back to the office and they are good, but pure sugar !   All in All - eating here is great and you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  This guy has been running the business for 25 years and rightfully so. The food is very good and very cheap. 4$ lunch specials give you a nice plate of curry, rice and bread.  I had the Channa Bhatura and it was perfect. The inside is clean and feels like a Tim Hortons.  However, my favorite part of this restaurant was the \"bakery\" there was a huge display of all types of different Indian sweets. I've never seen that many different sweets at any Indian place.  I just gave the guy 3$ and he loaded this little box with 6-7 different delights."}
{"text":"Upon entering Sweet India for dinner, I was faced with a decision that I don't often encounter:  Do I order chicken, or do I order goat?  Now I'm typically one who's very open to trying new things, and I've never had goat, but, I'll admit, I was a little scared to try it hear.  Needless to say, I ordered a CHICKEN curry, and it was utterly delicious.  Whatever this place may have lacked in ambiance, service, and perceived cleanliness, it made up for with one of the best curry dishes that I've ever eaten!  If you are a business traveler and stuck at a hotel around the Toronto airport (like I was), make your way over to Sweet India for a unique meal that you will NOT regret (I guess as long as your not sharing a hotel room/bathroom with anyone)"}
{"text":"Fresh. Fast. Busy. Thali a good deal at $6. Great flavours without too much salt. I'd give it another star but i don't like eating off styrofoam when I eat at the restaurant. Spoke with the owner. Proud of his 30 years in business."}
{"text":"When I used to live in Brampton, my older brother always came here for take out. He raved about their butter chicken and after trying a few bites of his take out I agreed, definitely one of the creamier (sweet) variations I've had.   I moved from Brampton to Mississauga west, so my brother hasn't brought any home for quite a few years now. Today, a few of us were heading to visit a friend who unfortunately broke his ankle before Christmas and was home bound. So after narrowing our stomach growls for Indian, I was put in charge of feeding 4 people.   I thought about the most cost efficient and Sweet India came up. There are 2 store fronts in the same plaza now, so I walked into the newer one. The gentleman who looked like the owner, was polite (not overly friendly but definitely helpful) and available. I asked his opinion about the amount I was ordering for 4 people and he was pretty honest and didn't really pressure me to order more.   Everything on the menu is individual portions and doesn't come with naan or rice unless it's a combo. But the prices are amazing- running from about $4-$6 per dish. They also have 2 fridges full of indian sweets that are available by the pound.   My order: 2 butter chickens (creamy and no traces of tomato base) 1 goat vindaloo (Flavorful, but not much spice) 1 saag paneer (Delicious, the paneer wasn't stale and was still soft) 1 chana masala (Ok...) 1 chicken biryani (I've definitely had better but it was tasty and not mushy) 2 orders of naan (meh... definitely smaller than most other indian restaurants) 1 order of galab jaman (Good)  Total: $39 (WOWZA) when my friends were paying me later after the meal... they tried to give me $40 each lol They couldn't believe the amount they ate was only $39 total. Amazing prices!  CONS:  There isn't a ton of meat in the curries, but a fair amount given that the curry portion is individual size.   Everything they serve is in styrofoam which isn't environmentally friendly... take out I get (most asian places) but sit down too :/  Parking is limited and not a lot of spaces to back out.  I'll be back the next time I'm responsible for take out! I prefer other indian restaurants in Mississauga for sit down meals though."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck when you're feeling for Indian food! I come here all the time for their butter chicken which is awesome! The vindaloo is not as spicy as I would like but still good, and their sweets are also incredible. Their stuffed peppers, curries, and vegetarian dishes are also very flavourful. Would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"This place had some interesting Yelp reviews, so I went for it since I was working in the area.  The place looks new, but I discovered they had not moved the kitchen over from their old location in the same strip mall.  I walked down and ordered the Chicken Curry with Naan for a whole $7.  The owner sent me back to the air conditioned comfort of the new location to sit down at a table there to eat.  It was delicious! A unique curry flavour that I have not had at any other Indian restaurant I have tried.  There was a respectable amount of meat-one drumstick and one thigh, and more than enough sauce to justify a whole Naan.  But in the new location, there are large glass cases with a stunning variety of traditional deserts.  That is what really makes Sweet India \"sweet\"!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Everything looked so good, we ordered so much food that we enjoyed it the next day as well. Everything was delicious. The only issue would be that each time we ate we all were super thirsty.  The portions were generous and the food was inexpensive.  Friendly customer service. They even gave us complementary samosas while we were waiting for our order."}
{"text":"Week 2 of my \"Indian Food Obsession\". I have eaten some type of Indian/Pakistani food almost every other day! And I'm still not over it!  Today, I got take-out from Sweet India: butter chicken, rice and naan for the kids and goat biryani for me. Some mithai too, including a rather uncommon petha (candied winter melon).   My goat biryani was delicious. Plenty of tender morsels. Well-spiced rice. For $4.99, it was just the right size for me (about 2 cups of food). I'm supposed to be on a low-carb diet, lol.  The kids said the butter chicken was delicious but didn't care much for the naan. Said it was a bit gummy. I wonder if the texture was bad because it had been wrapped in foil and taken to go?  Rice and naan cost extra, which is good if you are trying to watch the carbs.  There is a small seating area now for dining-in but it's still a basic place.   I will be back!  Footnote: the boxes of sweets from various places had been piling up on my kitchen counter. Today, I noticed that Sweet India's box is gone - although it was the most recent addition. Guess we liked it the best. My favourite sweet was the Special Barfi. It tasted like saffron. I will have to go back and ask them. And get some more. Might as well pick up some goat biryani and butter chicken while I'm at it!  Sept 2016:   Sweet India has finally moved into their shop and unfortunately, the quality has been affected. The butter chicken was dry and tasteless (boiled breast meat?) but the death blow was the barfi - I put a piece in my mouth and had to rush to spit it out. It was covered in GREEN MOULD!"}
{"text":"This place is a guaranteed spot to stop for some good Indian food. Not fancy but clean and tasty.  The crowd who eats here is diverse as is the food selection. The food and the sweets are both delicious."}
{"text":"I used to go a lot. Good Indian Food. Try whatever you feel like. Really."}
{"text":"Thick creamy butter chicken, great samosas. Limited seating. Street parking close by."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Friday with some of my colleagues. It was quite busy and a bit challenging to get a table. It's kind of like cafeteria style where you order, pay and then they call your number so you can get your meal.  They seemed very disorganized and it took a long time for us to get our food; albeit, everything was already prepared. They actually forgot about my order (butter chicken, rice and naan) and I kind of had to argue that they never gave it to me. When I finally got it, everything was cold. The butter chicken wasn't bad but it was way too saucy and a little on the sweet side; kind of more like \"butter chicken soup.\" Not to mention, the meals are served on these big square plates which may it difficult to maneuver as the tables were quite small.  Having said all this, I would give it another chance as my colleague's chicken tikka masala looked delicious and it was hot."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Sweet India! I have been coming here for over 15 years now. Unfortunately, I no longer live in Toronto and I've moved 3000 miles away to California. But every time I visit, I always stop by to indulge my taste buds. How I miss you, Sweet India.   For less than $4 you CANNOT beat the plate of Channa Bhatura. The bhatura is never oily - it's always so soft and perfect. I was here about 2 weeks ago and the quality and taste of the food has not changed."}
{"text":"My colleague and I arrived here at 12:15 during our lunch break and there were maybe 10 people in line in front of us. They did not take our order for over 25 minutes and we did not get our food for another 25 after that. There were 4 women behind the counter and I have never seen less efficient people. Especially in a place where the food is already prepared and all they need to do is scoop and pack. They were extremely slow, easily distracted, and stopped to consult one another before doing the next thing. They repeatedly referred to the monitor with all the orders, which is not a bad thing, but it's also not very encouraging when they're putting together the daily special (butter chicken with rice and naan). After waiting what felt like an eternity, I asked about our food. They quickly (surprise!) made mine and then we waited another 15 minutes for my colleague's order although he had ordered immediately after me. I just don't understand how you can be that level of inefficient! Also, the butter chicken is so watery, it's not great."}
{"text":"This small shop is what Indian food is supposed to be. They have perfected taste, quality, friendliness, and price. To be sure, this is no upscale establishment and it doesn't try to bill itself as one. You order your food and sit at a table until you are called to retrieve your food. But if you can overcome these limitations, the food is homestyle Indian and very tasty. All of the vegetable curries I tried (paneer, daal, channa, saag) were great and all of their breads tasted fresh. My entire meal including a mango lassi was $9. I will certainly be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love eating here. We have breakfast here every time we visit Mississauga.   The chole bhature, halwa chole n puri and any And every sweet we have ever ordered here has been yummy.  Must visit"}
{"text":"Note:  This restaurant uses styrofoam plates/cups.  There is no waiter service here, hence the low prices!  Once I drove up and saw the casual-ness of the dining facility, I tempered my expectations.  After all, it is 1 $ sign on Yelp.  I should've fully investigated the pics before I drove out from 'ssauga.  As you can see from the posted menu, mains are hovering the $6 mark.  Naan/rice is extra if you don't order a meal or thali, but prices are still reasonable.  Portion sizes are fair for what you pay, I wouldn't say HUGE or anything.  Butter Chicken - Gravy is more on the sweet side with a hint of coconut milk.  Not my fav version of this dish.  Goat Curry - Decent flavour.  Again, waaay more sauce than protein, but ok for price point.  Onion Salad - I did not like this.  I like onions, don't mind raw onions, but something about raw, salted onions did not awaken my taste buds.  Naan & Rice - Both pretty basic.  Naan was more of a flat pita, definitely not a fluffy, fresh naan.  Rice was alright with little cumin seeds in it.  It was good that neither of these sides were too filling as I find gravies/curries quite heavy enough!  Chicken Pakora - Dry.  Already prepared and they go to the back to 'ding' it.  So it became dry after reheated.  I did like the green raita sauce with raw red onions tho'.  Chicken Biryani - I don't know the name of this style, but it's more Southern Indian, as opposed to Pakistani style.  Rice was a bit more mushy and had a red tinge, not yellow which I prefer.   Atmosphere:  '80s, former ice cream/coffee shoppe looking.  Peach walls.  And old pink/mint green cafeteria style table with swivel stools, think McD's before renos - if you're old enough.  Appears clean, washroom was a bit dingy.  One thing that I REALLY didn't like was the fact that there's tons of waste.  All meals/drinks, even dine-in, are plastic or styro, so that equals to lotsa stuff going into the landfill which doesn't make me feel good.   Again, temper your expectations.  I wouldn't mind visiting again for a quick meal if I was in the area.  However, I wouldn't drive out there to dine-in."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I live near square one but have a couple friends in Malton and we always go here when we get together. Their Chana Bhatura is really good, and extremely cheap! If you're looking for a satisfying meal for under 5 dollars, I would highly recommend it. I have also had the butter chicken before when I'm looking for a meat option and have enjoyed it as well. The one downside is that they give you food in paper plates and the owner can be a little stingy when it comes to extra plates/napkins. Overall, great food at great prices!"}
{"text":"Sweet India is by far the most delicious, homestyle indian food I have ever tasted. As I work at YYZ, popping in every week or two for some chicken karahi, butter chicken, or any of their other delicious curries is a ritual. Being able to get a meal that actually tastes good for $5 which includes bread and rice is next to unheard of these days. They also have a very large selection of sweets and other Indian \"snacks\" like samosas and pakoras but I have yet to try them. The place is very busy at lunch and has only a few tables so if you plan on eating in, arrive early!   I highly suggest their bhatura bread with your meal. Prior to eating at Sweet India I had no idea what I was missing!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place. I don't live near it but try to stop by when I am in the area because it is so GOOD! The samosas are plump and delicious! There are often line ups to get them but the line moves fast! I haven't had a chance to try their other dishes as I have to keep on my way but I wish I lived closer. Sadly the price has increased over the years. I miss when the samosas were 3 for a dollar so I could stock up! Definitely recommended and worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I came in today.. I thought kwality sweets had the best samosas in town.. this one is up to par. The butter chicken was delicious, unlike kwality.. Everything is amazing but the butter chicken. This place has good desserts too. I tried the bharfi desserts and the vegetable pakora and the briyani and everything was very tasty. Not to over the top spicy, just the perfect touch. Definitely recommend and they are Very Affordable! Most Indian restaurants I go to usually likes to dig deep into my pockets but not this place! 23 bucks for everything! I might even become a regular, jeez"}
{"text":"We make a trip here all the way from Toronto every time we want Indian food. It's hard to find something that we don't like here. The samosas are fantastic and come with tamarind sauce and a mint sauce, I usually pick about 40 up for my colleagues at work as they come in a very presentable 'Tim it's' style box.  The service is extremely fast and the staff is very friendly. They went through a recent renovation and the place is clean and welcoming. Their prices are about 1/2 what you would be paying at most Indian restaurants and their food is way better. Highly recommend!  Oh - the sweet bar is also really really REALLY GOOD! If you like gulag jams - they have 3 or 4 types!!!"}
{"text":"This is how a 5 star Indian place tastes like. I've never seen such reasonable prices on the menu in any restaurant. Who sells samosas for 70c anymore or biryani for 4 bucks? The place itself isn't big but comfortable enough to have a quick meal. And the food is just fantastic and unpretentious. Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"Love the place inside. Very clean (including the bathrooms). We ordered a chaat paapri, 1 veggie thali and 1 meat thali. Everything tasted so good. I think the chaat paapri was the best I ever had. The only criticism I have is that the saag was just way too spicey for me! I was surprised at how well the rice was cooked too. Would definitely come back here. The bread pakoray/spring rolls looked very fresh and appetizing too!"}
{"text":"If you are going during a work lunch do not it took 40 mins for the food to come out today. I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo, the food was good, they gave me one piece of a potato and the rest was the curry. They person taking our order didn't seem to understand what we were asking for, she was slow and confused, she meant well however."}
{"text":"I found Sweet India Restaurant through Yelp. I was in Toronto for work and wanted to try something that wasn't Tim Hortons (although I love their maple donut!). I was staying near the airport and found Sweet India to be close by.   The restaurant is located in an interesting strip mall. The strip mall is a bit sketchy and parking was full. Sweet India is located in the middle of the strip mall.    When I walked in, I smelled home-cooked Indian food. There are display cases for sweets, and the menu is posted on a board. I ordered the butter chicken, saag paneer, garlic naan and rice. The total was $15.   The butter chicken was the best. It was flavorful and I can taste the butter and Indian spices.  I could have just eaten the sauce by the spoonful, like soup!    The saag paneer was okay.  It wasn't my favorite and I may have been biased, having eaten the butter chicken first.   The garlic naan was warm and fresh. But the rice was a bit cold.   I am happy I tried a new restaurant. I would definitely recommend the butter chicken and garlic naan."}
