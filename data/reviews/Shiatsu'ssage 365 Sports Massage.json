{"text":"I rarely post a negative reviews, I try and give the benefit of the doubt. This I can't let go. I wish I read the reviews before of similar events. I bought a GroupOn and texted Aya for an appointment. She said she had 3:30pm available the next day. I gave her my full name and asked if she needed any other information. She responded No. I arrive at Baroque Beauty Center at 3:20pm and the receptionist said have a seat. At 4pm, I asked if she was working and told her client before me was running late, he thought. At 4:15pm I asked if he knew how late and he said no.  When I said please let her know I was here and I would like a refund. He and the Stylist said ok and they'd leave to after waiting an hour. They inferred this is a common practice with Aya. I texted her at 4pm asking her status and at 4:20pm before I left asking for a refund. At 5:40pm she texted me, it is my fault for not confirming my appointment in the morning. She has to many GroupOn no shows and doesn't come in if it's not confirmed. I replied you never said I needed to confirm. I forwarded a copy of our interaction the day before and said there is nothing saying I need to confirm in the morning?!?! Who does this?  She never apologized and told me to contact GroupOn for a credit. Then proceeded to say she was trying to help me and she'd pray for me because God could help me more then she could? Seriously, not sure how she was helping. I made an appointment and she flakes out. Very poor business."}
{"text":"Aya is the best therapist I have ever had! Her ability to sense what your body needs by the touch of her hands is exceptional! I have felt a sense of overall wellness with her as my massage therapist. Her shiatsu is exhilarating and your body feels so wonderful after! Her knowledge and knowing what you need to do to keep your body in sync is a rewarding experience! She's a very caring therapist that will treat your whole body and make you feel tremendous! I would not go to anyone else!"}
{"text":"This may just be the best massage in Las Vegas!  Aya is wonderful --  super warm, friendly, and professional.  She's fantastic at deep work and making your problem areas go away.   It's the best experience to get a massage from her.  She responds quickly to scheduling requests and her pricing is extremely reasonable.  I had tried so many mediocre massage places before I found Aya, and now I never look for anyone else cause she's the best."}
{"text":"Love love love Aya!  I've been to her a few times now with a few different problems, mainly pulled back muscles and tight hamstrings.  Each time I leave feeing amazing, refreshed and, best of all, without pain!  Truly a miracle worker!  Anytime I'm hurt I call her right away.  She returns texts in a timely fashion and fits me in.  She is very knowledgable in her trade, as well as holistic healing and living.  I learn something new every time.  I highly recommend Aya for the best massage ever!"}
{"text":"Aya is an amazing person and an even better masseuse. She will tell you about any alignment issues and even recommend exercises to correct these issues. It was the most detailed 1 hour massage I have ever had. She knew all my tense and sore spots and tackled them with vigor. I highly recommend her services."}
{"text":"Aya is the BEST Sports Massage therapist in Las Vegas. I've been having deep tissue massage for over 20 years and have had a lot of massages due to stenosis, sciatica, arthritis, etc. 
Without a doubt my body has been feeling and performing much better since I started on a regular massage schedule with Aya. She listens to where my pain is then addresses it with her knowledge of what body part to work on and her solid execution of deep tissue massage, including stretching. Aya is excellent at what she does and loves making people feel better. Give her a call or text at 702-741-8016 to schedule an appointment with her. You'll feel like a new person after a few massage treatments with Aya...!"}
{"text":"Aya Yamanaka is one of the best massage therapists I have ever met. Professional in every way and a truly nice person. A great massage from someone like Aya will make your day! You will enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"Aya is absolutely awesome! I went in today at 1:00 pm with lower back pain and it is now 4:00 and I am pain free. I work in a hospital emergency room and I am constantly lifting and moving patients so my body takes a beating. I will definitely become a regular! Best massage ever!"}
{"text":"I saw many good reviews for this massage so I decided to try. Please note that I have had many shiatsu massages, I  am very fit, athletic, do not drink and health-conscious to a degree most people can't comprehend because  of what I had to do to beat terminal cancer, myeloma, 38 years ago.

If you want a therapist who does not stop talking for the entire session and lectures you on all her theories of what's wrong with you this is the perfect place. According to her I have osteoporosis, arthritis, something wrong with my calf muscles, and I need Cortizone shots somewhere in my back though she doesn't quite know where.

Finally after telling her I will not do Cortizone shots as they are not healthy and can cause blindness we ended up in a lively one sided discussion with her lecturing me on and on about how she heals people and finally I could not take it anymore and got up and said I'm leaving as I came to relax and not get verbally abused. When you want to get a relaxing massage getting lectured by an opinionated, want a be doctors/healer is  not what I expected to pay for.

As for the massage this does not resemble any of  the probably 50 shiatsu massage I have had in my life. Even a bad massage occasionally feels good in some spots but she was not able  to provide even one moment of a good feeling. Which is hard to believe unfortunately .

Generally I hate writing negative reviews because I don't want to affect someone's livelihood. But this massage crossed the line that I feel others should know about the experience.
Thanks 
John

 Update. Since I posted this review I have received nine texts from Aya. The texts bragged about her skill and offered negative comments about me. I did not respond to any of them but they just kept coming.

One text said that she would never work on someone like me with negative energy. This is interesting since at the beginning of the massage she specifically stated that I had very good positive energy.

Another text stated that I had emotional problems. Looking through the reviews I see that she also told someone else something similar who dared to post  a negative review. This must be her go to comment.

Hopefully the text are done. I'm not sure how she has so much time to keep sending me texts when she bragged in one of them that she has 300 regular clients.
Thanks"}
{"text":"I found this place while in town for work.  I had recently been in car accident and was having many ailments, so found this place that happened to open passed 630.  

From her initial assessment, The therapist was very in tuned to what my body was needing. 
 I am very aware that one session will not heal a body but She definitely put me back on the path to recovery.  
I left feeling 1000 times better than I walked in and made a follow up appointment for two days later. 
If one is a skeptic about massage therapy,  this place will erase any doubts."}
{"text":"The place is professional, clean & well kept.

Best massage I've gotten in Vegas.

I will definitely keep coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Aya is so strong and intuitive!! She is incredible at deep work, finding those trouble areas and working on them till they are gone!! I always leave feeling (a little sore, but) renewed!"}
{"text":"I would like to first start off by saying, thank you. Thank you so much. My girlfriend and I come to you seeking help and you truly deliver with every expectation met hands down. God gave you the gift of healing others and we am blessed to say that we are your patient. You've been very caring, genuine, and so supportive in our lives in the short time you've met us. We come in sick, exhaust, and tired and yet, you heal us back and fill us with strength and relief. I can finally say that I've found my doctor who can help me. Thank you so much!!! We look forward to the next visit next week!"}
{"text":"Aya is very friendly and professional. Every time after my massage treatment with her I always feel so relaxed. 
I would definitely recommend her to my friends and family member. 
Big thumb up for aya !!"}
{"text":"She is a very professional and well-trained.?The purpose of going to Las Vegas is to go to her.
She is so strong and very nice person I've ever met:)"}
{"text":"Amazing ladies!!! Worth every penny. Very kind and worked with our time table. Hands down one of my favorite parts of our trip. We will be sure to return on our next vacation."}
{"text":"Sweet baby biscuits! 

This woman is amazing.  I REALLY needed a massage and she delivered exactly what I needed, and included hot stones!

1. She is an amazing massage therapist. She didn't just apply lotion to my back. I wanted pressure and I got pressure, but not too much.  She is truly talented and a hard worker. 

2.  She is very kind and friendly. Her personality is legit!  I came in to relax, and the massage was not awkward by any means. She made me feel at home. 

3. She is incredibly knowledgable. She educated me on the importance of hydration. 

4.  She is a massage therapist NOT a salesperson. No pressure (minus the pressure on my back).

5. Incredibly fair prices. 

Oh, and she even offered me a stick of gum at the end. PERFECT!

If it were possible to bring her with me to LA I would. If you are in Las Vegas/Clark County and need a massage, check her out.  I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Aya is a very professional massage therapist. She is well educated in her chosen profession. I trust her when she tells me what I need to do to stay healthy and strong. Aya is the best !"}
{"text":"I told the therapist I would update my review, so here it is. Later than I originally said, but here nonetheless.

1) I did end up getting a credit from Groupon. Used the credit to buy a massage from a different provider, but I probably won't use Groupon again unless it's for known stores I already frequent.

2) The therapist called, left a voice message, then sent a bunch of text messages a few days after my original review. I presume she did this after she saw my 1-star Yelp review. She was trying to get me to change my review. I now understand what Anne T. meant by harassment. She kept calling my review \"malicious\" and \"evil\", then trying to get me to reschedule a free massage. Umm... no thanks. I'm getting all sorts of crazy vibes, and I don't believe in getting services like this for free. She kept blaming the owner of the salon repeatedly because they were waxing the spa floor (apparently without giving any notice to any of the therapists at the salon). Even if it were true, it is still her responsibility for letting her clients know when she needs to reschedule, regardless of the reason why a reschedule is needed."}
{"text":"Either a very close friend of the owner or the owner herself decided to contact me two days ago after I had not contacted the business in over a year. Due to the initial harassment I did my best to avoid contact with this person and warned them that I would seek legal action if they continued to contact me. It is extremely unprofessional and I will recommend to avoid this business at all costs."}
{"text":"I have bad pain at my lower back, neck and shoulder from too many business trip with economy class and desk work. Aya-San's massage was painful but felt relieve and good. I am living in LA but it worth to go every 2-3 month."}
{"text":"Great masseuse for deep tissue and Japanese cupping.  Very knowledgeable with a range of massage techniques, e.g., shiatsu, sports, deep tissue, Swedish, etc.  Ava know the acupressure points and will go as deep as you can tolerate.  One of the best in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Aya is amazing! I had so much back, shoulder and neck pain and she just worked out all the knots and painful spots. Seriously if you have the opportunity you should visit her, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Aya has done wonders for my shoulder,  i cant say enough about how much she has helped me. I was in constant pain until I went to her for a treatment.  I had gone to multiple doctors, had cortisone shots and acupuncture but nothing worked. My husband had gifted me a message with her but what he really gifted me was a pain free shoulder! I am so happy that I found her!!"}
{"text":"Aya is the true definition of deep tissue, therapeutic, sports massage. She specializes in shiatsu massage and is incredibly strong! I told her where I wanted her to emphasize on and my pain was gone the next day. I purchased a 90 minute massage from her and she did a total of 2 hours for me anyway! She uses essential oils and the aromatherapy makes a world of a difference. Aya is very passionate about her work and it definitely shows."}
