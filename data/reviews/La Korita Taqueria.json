{"text":"If i could give this place a zero star I would!! It is so overpriced! We had to switch tables 2 times because of how unstable the tables were!! I ordered 4 tacos de asada and the meat was really burnt and the tortillas was soggy and the tacos are full pf cilantro and onion. Honestly don't go here and save you money! We ended up paying 58.80 for 10 tacos and a torta de asada!! Worse place i have ever ate at.. so pissed!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, they greet you with a smile. The food is outstanding. They have a little salsa bar which I love. Have different heat levels, which I like a little heat. This place is a hidden gem that you will love and won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is under new management and it is absolutely delicious! If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, check it out. Mom was in the kitchen cooking and the son was waiting tables. We had lengua tacos, al pastor tacos, chicken flautas, rice and beans. The refried beans were incredible, maybe the best I've had- serves with a nice piece of Oaxaca cheese on top. The flautas were crunchy and not greasy. We will def be back."}
{"text":"Tasty food, friendly staff, clean place. They have quesadillas de flor de calabaza and huitlacoche! However, they were mostly cheese and a bit expensive. Service was very slow even though it was empty at Friday dinner."}
