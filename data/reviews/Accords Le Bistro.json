{"text":"Le Bistro Accord situé tout près du Quartier des spectacles offrent un menu frais et savoureux. Les portions pourraient plus généreuses, par contre, les saveurs et la présentation sont au rendez-vous. Notre serveur, Philippe, est définitivement un passionné de son métier et de ses clients. Une superbe soirée avant un magnifique spectacle! Merci à toute l'équipe."}
{"text":"Best and most tender octopus we've ever had! Service was excellent and so were the main courses  (flank steak for hubby and local fish for me). Chocolate ganache dessert was not too sweet and a great way to end our meal."}
{"text":"Delicious.  As for service, I've never before had the waitress put down menus and then start explaining upwards of eight individual entrees as in-depth as this - I was quite parched and really wished we could have been served some water before the lecture began, but I appreciate the attention.  There was a nice selection of local draft beers; we bypassed the tasting menu and ordered three individual plates.  For two people, three or four such plates are necessary.  The burrata was outstanding, a delicious and generous amount of cheese on a tasty bread artfully decorated with flowers.  The homemade pasta and the fish of the day were well executed.  The desserts were lovely.  I consider this to be an expensive restaurant, but worth it."}
{"text":"This place offers unique food and drink options that are delicious. Try the orange wine!"}
{"text":"The $45 fixed menu is a great deal, was a 5 course meal that included an insanely delicious duck steak. The muahroom butter tastes wonderful and the service top notch. I highly recommend this reataurant. 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Montreal on the occasion of my 40th birthday. This was luckily my first stop. On happenstance, I found this place on Google and decided to pop in for dinner. Full disclosure, I am a chef, which makes me typically the absolute most obnoxious kind of critic. I have to say, however, the food here is absolutely outstanding. The boudin with bok choy and mustard was perhaps one of the best bites I've had in some time (sorry guys, I might steal that one). The oyster mushroom risotto was flawless; creamy, delectable, and perfectly executed. The atmosphere is sophisticated without being pretentious. The staff are all friendly, bilingual (I only speak english and spanish, and they were more than accommodating). I cannot recommend this place enough, from their exceptional knowledge of wines and local cocktails to their passion for farm-to-table and local, sustainable food, this is a must-visit when you are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This meal was a treat. Perfect for more refined, elevated French food--\"foodie\" in quality and vision without the stuffiness. Perfect portions, plentiful bread and really great service.  The desserts were as good if not better than the food (which is rare!!) and had probably the best octopus I've ever had. Very reasonably priced considering the quality of the food and wine we got. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nous y avons été dans le cadre de Montréal à table. Le menu de Montréal à table m'a un peu déçue. L'entrée (tartare de thon) était bonne, mais dépourvue de saveur (juste du thon cru, frais certes, mais sans arôme, sans agrément, sans épice). Le plat (maquereau pour ma part) était assez sec et peu copieux, comme en témoigne la photo. Le dessert (savarin pour ma part) était accompagné d'une crème de thé vert et d'une sauce cassis, ce qui faisait un drôle de mélange en bouche. Bref, je suis un peu critique sur ce coup là, mais sans doute que j'étais juste déçue par le menu de Montréal à table, je m'attendais à d'autres choses.. Sinon, j'ai goûté le flan de porc de mon ami et c'était très bon. Vins un peu chers (verre: 11$ ++ ) Très bon service. Allez y et faites vous un avis par vous même! :)"}
{"text":"I do not think I ever had such bad experience with any food place. Ordered the \"tasting menu\" with a glass of wine. The tasting menu consisted of some juvenile experiments with some-what rotten products. The glass of wine smelled like cat litter box, i am not sure if they did some-thing to that half open bottle of wine or glass itself, but i still can't forget that smell.  Never ever again I will go to that place, nor recommend it to any one. Stay away."}
{"text":"For any out of towners or locals alike, this place is definitely worth a try. The chefs tasting menu is not for the unadventurous, but the flavors that takes ones palette on a journey throughout the meal is for every foodie out there. The price is unbeatable with the wine pairing, which compliments each course beautifully. HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"I've returned to Accords and nothing has changed...and I mean this in a very yummy and delicious way.    The seasonal menu changes look amazing.  I had the octopus (again), but this time dressed up with a potato purée and chunks.  Very delicious.  The orange wine!  The orange wine!  Must try.   Finally, the service staff - Shaun Audrey and Serge - are amazing.  Overall, a wonderful third experience. Til next time."}
{"text":"A delightful gem that we discovered! The 5-course meal with wine pairing is the absolute thing to do here. And at $75 CAD - it is quite a deal. Dined outside and everything was prepared to perfection for a Summer's night. The farm to table vegetables had an overpoweringly fresh flavor. Absolutely delicious. Now the city of Montreal should just close off the adjacent road and leave only foot traffic - and the experience would simply be perfect!"}
{"text":"Highly impressed! Would definitely recommend, would definitely return!   Came here for a McGill Alumni Wine Tasting and Pairing event with my dad on a warm and rainy Wednesday evening.   The Bistro's two Sommeliers were spectacular and endearing. Both down to earth, friendly, passionate and knowledgeable about every one of the 5 Austrian wines they presented and paired thoughtfully with perfectly conceived bouchées.   This event was geared at the seasoned wine connoisseurs and the amateurs, such as myself, alike. I was enthralled in a panoply of information and sensations and I would gladly repeat the occasion a million times over.  In particular the duck confit croquettes were to die for, my favorite taste of the night! Also of particular note, would be the dessert wine, which was out of this world; and we were among the last people to get to savour it here in Québec, as we had the last 3 bottles only available via import.   The service was impeccable and unwaivering. The price was definitely on the higher scales but worth every penny. I can't wait to go back for a tasty treat and a very good well sought glass of wine!"}
{"text":"On connaissait le restaurant Accords dans la vieille ville, voici Le Bistro situé au quartier des spectacles! Yeah! Une très bonne place à hauteur d'un bon souper en amoureux, mais aussi d'un délicieux verre de vin en terrasse accompagné d'un menu spécial :) Comme son nom l'indique, on vous conseille sur les accords met-vin, en effet, hésitant sur le choix de mon plat, le serveur m'a conseillé avec brio, les pétoncles: Chaque bouchée était fondante et en parfait accord avec Le Blanc. La cuisson du steak de mon conjoint tout à fait à son goût. Nous fûmes comblés.  Excellente adresse, aussi bien dans le vieux Montréal qu'en plein cur de la ville! Si votre budget vous le permet, permettez vous le :)"}
{"text":"Great service. Very knowledgeable staff. Drinks were delicious. Good location, very convenient to just for laughs festival site."}
{"text":"Looked good inside but very disappointing food :(  and wine pairing was the worst I ever had... boxed wine is better . I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"The best dinner experience in Canada. We had the chefs choice, only the second week they've done this, and I had the wine pairing with it. Best choice we've made here. The whole meal was an unforgettable experience. Tons of food, great local ingredients and local wine. I wish I could eat here every week. Save your $ and take a nice night to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good. Food was average. I had a chicken with mushrooms and beans, friends had pasta and flank steak. The consensus was food was good but nothing spectacular. Service was good but the wine recommendation was pretty bad. We ended up paying around $70-$80 each with a cocktail and a bottle of wine. I can have a pretty awesome dinner for that price at many other comparable restaurants. So three stars is fair, a good place to socialize with friends not to have a great dinner, at least not for what you will have to pay. Staff could use some education about wine pairing."}
{"text":"Incredible food and somewhat fancy. The portions are small but if you are looking for an authentic French place to eat, this is the right place."}
{"text":"Menu court pour des produits frais et bien travaillés. Belle carte de vins et un excellent acceuil. Je recommande chaleureusement."}
{"text":"We really liked this place! Food was excellent and unique. The food pairings and seasons were interesting and delicious. We arrived at a busy time for dinner but the Maître de would not seat us, not because there were no tables, but because she did not have enough staff to serve a proper dinner, a nice touch! We waited until the Restaurant cleared a little, and were seated for an excellent meal. The waiter spoke excellent English and French. We had the chief's choice dinner. 3 courses all unique. Each item was fully explained as it was served. The meal was $45 CD per person, wine extra. A great value in my opinion.   This restaurant also has a second location in the old Montreal Port area, with the same format. it was also excellent."}
