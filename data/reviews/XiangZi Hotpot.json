{"text":"Horrible?? Please don't go! There is not much food and the price is ridiculous. You even have to pay for the sauce fee. There not much variety of foods and some of them is not fresh. It's totally not with the money. I will not recommend for anyone!  Bad service. I wouldn't even give one star."}
{"text":"The break down: $35 weekdays/$39 weekends is the price to pay to even exist inside lel $6 extra for small pot of soup.  $15 extra for a large one to share. $2 HIDDEN Sauce/Seasoning Fee even if you don't take any.  Premium beef/lamb/pork starting at $9 extra You might have heard that there is no English on the menus but that is false. Coca Cola was on there. What's unique is that they have ChengDu style - oily spicy broth.  There's a selection of appetizers mostly stir fry.  There's a sleeve and apron available to try keep clothes from smelling.  Decor is amazing. Two floors, buffet is on ground floor, watch the oily stairs.  Slightly better than average quality food. Let's be honest how much better can frozen food be?"}
{"text":"This is my first review. Finally tired it today but totally disappointed. Decoration is amazing as everyone said. There are a lot self-serve food choices but nothing is special. They charged $21 for the soup base which is big surprise. If you dont like salty food, never go there, the expansive soup base is way too salty. And not like little sheep, they didnt  offer free drink. For me, the quality of the meats (mostly sliced beef and lamb) is most important. However, the frozen meat there is  pretty bad, not even at the average compare to other $20 AYCE hot pot. At the end, they charged $160 for 3 of us. I paid $200, the waiter ask me if I need change. Excuse me! Sry, I am not rich as you think. The waiter came back with the change and waited there while I was talking to friends. So I asked she what she was waiting for. She answered that she need to get the tips back first.   I am not sure if they know that the customer probably never come back again so they have to supervise the tipping process. The whole experience was so bad,we left  $20 tips and would never come back again."}
{"text":"We live across the street from this place and being the foodies we are, we just had to try this newest hot pot joint. Over all this place is way pricer then we thought at about $50-$75 per person. Were not The biggest hot pot fans so maybe we cant appreciate it.. over prices food was ok.."}
{"text":"Yes it is a little bit expensive. But it's by far the most authentic Chengdu style hotpot restaurant in Toronto. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We paid almost $70 each person(with discount), The decoration is fancy, however, the Food is awful and no service! Not recommend at all! Terrible one!"}
{"text":"Food here is ordinary at best. Nothing special without additional cost.  I have never been to a hot pot place that charges $38 per person and has a separate soup cost of $16.  How are you supposed to cook the food? Decor is nice but that is it.  It's a shame as Markham has many great restaurants and we thought this would be one of them.    Also they don't accept US credit card.  If they use it another 5% on top of the ridiculous jacked up fees.    Definitely not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"I don't usually write any reviews, but when I do, the restaurant is either really good or really bad, and this place is definitely the latter. They do not have a huge variety of food, and the food is not particularly good or fresh. They are charging $38.99 (Friday to Sunday) per person and you have to pay extra for the pot of soup ($6 for a small pot). They are charging an extra $2 ish sauce fee as well, even if you didn't take any. This was my first time, and definitely the last time there. I would not recommend this overpriced and overrated place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food - Food was overall high in quality. There was a wide range of variety in raw and cooked food. It didn't seem they purchased low quality cheap food. Please keep up with the high quality of meat, seafood and vegetables!   Environment - Unique renovation that brought cultural elements to the surrounding. Great choice of dishes, cups, tea pots and utensils - all have a sense of history and culture with a hint of modernism.  Service - Wonderful. They were courteous and proactive with their service and hygiene. They came often to change plates and made sure the tongs used at the food stations were changed frequently for cleanliness. They even cared about the cleanliness of you clothes  and had the option to give you a cover for your jackets and aprons to use while eating. Awesome.  Overall - Excellent. Would recommend and come back for sure. It was be an added bonus if the price wasn't as pricey."}
{"text":"My friends and I travel to Toronto every year for good chinese food. This year we wanted to try something new and after seeing some promotional video on FB, we decided to try it.  What a disappointment. It is super expensive for a hot pot (about $55 - $60 total per person!), but if you include things like crab or lobster, then I can understand but they had only the basics (as you would find in other hot pot places). My friends and I all agree that we've had better in NYC at better prices too.  We are not one to balk at expensive places, but only if it was worth it. This wasn't...don't bother going unless you want overpriced hotpot in an albeit very pretty designed restaurant.  After so many years of going to Toronto and eating great food, both reasonably priced as well as some pricey seafood dinners, we've never been as disappointed as we were this time."}
{"text":"Except the hotpot foods,they also have plenty of side dishes and dipping sauces.          However, the shrimps are small,  lamb and beef slices are frozen,not freshly cutted.         Soup base choices are limited,and it is extremly pale and not flavoured at all. Even though they have good enviroment and luxury decoration, but till not really attractive to me.  $55 + for one person all you can eat,very pricy comparing to other hotpot places.           Will not go back again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere feels like I'm in Taiwan. I LOVE HOW IT IS SPACIOUS. Lots of room, decorations. Hot pot has a variety of options but it is pretty pricey. 35.99/ person for weekdays and 38.99/person  for weekends. It doesn't include the soup base which will have an additional costs to it. The selection of food and sauces are amazing. Leo has assisted us with our soup bases. Spicy soup base is \"really hot\"  so we were able to water down the soup.  I would recommend starting with the beef and mushroom broth. The service is awesomely fast! It's a great place to come every once in a while."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for-QUALITY!  yes it's expensive but it's clean, the food is fresh and you can't wait to dive in cause the meat is not questionable and the veggies are vibrant and beautiful. They have all you can eat snow pea leaves!!! Who the hell offers that?! They have jacket covers to keep your jacket from smelling of hotpot, bibs, and if you want super luxury items in your soup you can pay extra to get it. You can have a private room as well for any particular reason you want. You pay for top notch cleanliness and atmosphere, the sauce selection is amazing! I love morals village and I think it's the best in the city but this is comparable. It could be a tad cheaper and have more soup options or dual soup options for single person but other than that I love it! If you want cheaper old school hotpot go to the places that offer that. You wouldn't go to pizza libretto or a pizzeria with an atmosphere and expect to pay the same price as pizza pizza or expect the same quality. Same goes for everything in life, four seasons Hotel vs Howard Johnson...I'm sure you get my drift by now. Stop making it hard for businesses to do well by being unreasonable!"}
{"text":"Personally, I think this place has gotten some pretty unfair bad reviews. So, let me get the bad out of the way first. Yes, it is verrryyy expensive for hot pot. I came here on a Saturday night, and had their famous spicy soup base. The bill came to around $55 after tax and tips. So just be prepared to dish out that much money for hot pot if you plan on trying this place. A lot of people also complain that the soup is too oily. I agree that the soup does get very oily, but unfortunately that's just the nature of spicy hotpot. The traditional Sichuan spicy soup base is made with chili oil, and then as you continue adding all kinds of meat to the pot throughout the night, it'll just continue to get more oily. If you want to avoid the oil, make sure you keep the pot boiling, so that the oil will spread to the side, and dip the meat you want to eat in the middle.   Now, onto the good stuff. The restaurant definitely spend a lot of money on renovations, as the inside of the restaurant is beautiful (from the menu to the teapots to the overall decor). I found the service here to be very good. I came with a party of 16, and the moment we sat there, 3 waiters came up to our table to help put the \"pillow case\" over our jackets, and then asked if we had any questions and offered English menu where needed. Throughout the night, the waiters were constantly walking around to ensure our cups were never empty, adding soup to the pots, and handing out napkins when they saw that we needed more. I found that all the waiters were very friendly and helpful, which is the exact opposite of most other hotpot restaurants where service is pretty much non-existent.   The variety of food offered here was also much better than other hotpot places. They had a lot more unique items on top of the normal items that other restaurants offer. There was also a variety of seafood choices included in the ayce price like scallop, mussels, squid, shrimp. There was also an appetizer bar that offered many different choices of cold dishes.  I personally didn't try any of these items, but some of my friends did and some of the dishes were pretty yummy. They also have a dessert bar that offered fruits and a few pastries. The watermelon after all the spiciness was very refreshing. As others have mentioned, all the food items is set up in the middle of the room, and you go up to get your own food. I personally liked this better, as I can take whatever I want and the exact portions I wanted. Also, there wasn't the issue of waiters \"missing\" our orders, which happens quite often in the traditional ayce hotpot places.  Overall, I found XiangZi to be definitely better than other hotpot restaurants. Whether or not it's worth the extra $20/person...I'm not sure. I wouldn't mind coming back again, but definitely only for special occasions."}
{"text":"2 stars for food, and 4 stars for service. Overall 3 stars.  Food quality just as normal as regular hot pot place. You have to pay $35 to go in and eat, then you have to pay $15.99 extra for soup base, and $3+ dipping sause fees.   The decoration was good and it seems like they spent a lot of money on this but food quality is more important!  Also, i do not like the booth! Because those seats were soooo dirty.   I don't think i will go again."}
{"text":"Right when you walk in through the double doors, you already know you'll be paying a little more than your usual hotpot restaurant. I was blown away by the grand entrance and fancy décor used throughout the moment I entered. The owner definitely spent a lot of time and effort perfecting the ambiance of the restaurant to replicate traditional Chinese architecture. I was seated on the first floor which made the buffet very easily accessible versus being seated on the second floor giving you a very nice birds eye view of the buffet. I wouldn't have minded either seating arrangement. It's a matter of preference and whether or not you're bothered by having to carry your food up the stairs. The tables were laid out nicely with enough room for people to walk by without bumping shoulders with food and hot water in their hands. Aprons were provided for those who are messy eaters and are afraid they might stain their clothes with sauces while chair covers are provided to cover jackets and personal items in case the occasional passerby accidentally spills something which was a very nice touch. My family and I had selected the individual pot option so that we could each try a different broth for our hot pot experience. Each broth varied in price in addition to the price you'd be paying per person for all you can eat. You can also eat out of one pot which would be a little less expensive, however you'd all be limited to one flavour. There was a large variety of hotpot items, cooked foods, condiment options, and desserts to choose from at the buffet station that was constantly being replenished. Plates were constantly being cleared from the table and water was replenished in our pots all the time. Service was great, but the only downside to this whole experience was that the menu was mostly written in Chinese which may deter some customers. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Authentic hot pot, akin to nice restaurants in Sichuan, where authentic spicy hot pot originated. Staff are courteous, food selection is well curated, decor is gorgeous. Restaurant is spacious and comfortable. I had many great experiences dining here. Price is on the high end but for me, well worth it."}
{"text":"Was my expectations too high or was the food just bland?  So I came here on a busy evening night with my family and the place seem pretty full with customers. I was amazed at the overall interior and the decor: pretty well-designed!  Food- wise?  Not that impressive. I mean lots of options to choose from but everything didnt seem fresh.... felt like the food was placed there hours before. After the hotpot, I didn't feel too well.  I wouldn't be paying $50 per person.... over-priced and not worth the quality. I would not be coming back.  ( Service here was also a bit.....)"}
{"text":"Overpriced and quality of food was not amazing. We went on a weekend and it was surprisingly empty. Food trays were not replaced often and meat was often broken into pieces due to customers digging their tong into the trays. That definitely did not look appetizing.  Soup base was an extra charge. We got the non spicy L soup base which was an extra $16 (this was the cheapest  soup base on the menu). The bill came up at $53pp before tips which was definitely not worth at this hot pot restaurant. You will be paying only for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can see there are many low reviews. Honestly, I have tried couple hot pot places. I am going to give reviews in terms of price, food quality, food variety, and customer service.   1. Price: 38.99 per person is above average hot pot price but considering the interior design , which I wouldn't mind. (If you go to Ruth Chris Steak House , the Keg, miles stone, usually it's like 35-50 dollars for food without drinks). Nevertheless, adding 5.99 or 7.99 for hot pot soup doesn't make sense to me. It should be included in the buffet price. This is what everyone was upset or it's called hidden fees.    2. Food quality is about average. Since I didn't order any premium food which cost extra, I wouldn't be able to give a fair review.   3. Food variety: it has most selection by comparing to the average hot pot buffet places.   4.customer service: its about average. The servers are pretty attentive.  I don't have any complaints.   Overall, if you like to go to a hot pot place that has an incredible interior design and wouldn't mind paying a little premium, this would be the choice."}
{"text":"I have to admit that this hotpot restaurant is the most good-looking one in GTA. The furniture, lightings, and decorations are well presented and which provide superior impression for diners including me. After I saw the sides of the hallway after the entrance, my expectation for the food here was extremely high. When I saw the price for the all-you-can-eat option, I couldn't stop thinking how well and rare that the raw materials would be.   I believe my experience and comment is similar to the other Yelpers who had posted their reviews in the past. The expectation was high, but the food and the soup base, somehow and somewhat, were not appealing to our appetite. Maybe, we are not coming over here to just observe the interior design of the restaurant. Most importantly, our intention is to have the superior experience of how the hot pot here delivers the tasty food.  Don't take me wrong. I gave an average rating for the visit. If somehow, they can improve the taste of the soup base and lower the price a bit, the place can be a lot more popular. (Of course, at the end of the day, the business owners need to think about how many people can be served each day, and how much per person they need to charge in order to have a breakeven for the cost of the interior design and decoration besides making extra for them.)"}
{"text":"It's not bad. It really isn't, considering hot pot restaurants tend to get abysmal ratings on Yelp for some reason. There's potential here, but really the primary issue is the price. For almost $60 per person, even with a special \"discount\", it is quite expensive for the quality of the food.  I am a huge fan of hot pot, and I'm always down for trying a hot pot restaurant even if Yelp tells me to stay away. It's just... BlogTO made it look so good. Damn you BlogTO. The interior is really nice though, and looks just like what you see in their video. It is sort of annoying if you're on the second floor (half the tables are on the second floor) and you have to walk up and down the stairs every time you wanna grab something. I guess you could consider it exercise to leave more room in your stomach to get your money's worth.  The selection is the biggest I've ever seen but a lot of it is not really necessary. Everything is presented out in the open, which is good if you're going with a hot pot noob who wants to see exactly what everything looks like before they eat it. I prefer it, but you also have the downside of some stuff looking like it's been sitting out there for some time. It's a trade off I suppose. There's a whole section with cooked foods, but honestly they weren't that great aside from the chicken wings. The indication that they never need to be refilled is a sign that they're not good - probably should update them to something that not only tastes better but also looks more appetizing. The fruit section is a nice add-on though, I'd keep that.  The hot pot items themselves are alright. The meats are obviously not grade A but I honestly don't think you need high quality beef for hot pot when the broth is already so salted that it masks all the natural flavours of meat. The seafood items are cool, even though I'm wary of seafood at hot pot restaurants, it is a good thing if you're into that. I'm surprised though that some basic items like udon and fresh tofu are missing, but I guess to compensate they do have some more exotic selections like beef tongue, which I don't really think is a great in hot pot. But please keep the quail eggs, it's really all I personally need for hot pot and I'll come back as long as you keep them.  With the way everything is set up in the restaurant though, I think the price point could work. There really isn't a \"high-end\" hot pot restaurant and XiangZi could be the first. I think they just need to make it worth the $60. Drinks should be included in that price along with a drink bar somewhere. The dessert selection could be spiced up, perhaps add some mango pudding or tofu-fa or maybe even a soft serve machine!! Do better research to see which items are actually being consumed by customers - replace the stuff that no one is eating and add something else - aside from the fresh tofu and udon I also recommend dumplings (not just wontons), daikon, and fish paste. Add a dancing noodle man or something, to add some novelty and trick people into thinking that that novelty is somehow worth the price. Seem to be the trend these days for restaurants to add gimmicks, but hey, it works and they were pretty awesome when I saw them in China.  Aside from the decor though, another thing the restaurant does a pretty good job with is service. They provide covers to cover your jacket so they don't absorb the smell of hot pot. They provide aprons, which no one used but are kinda cute I suppose. The servers were attentive and polite, something I'm not really used to from hot pot restaurants, but I guess that's what $60 gets ya. The place is also really well ventilated, so it never felt stuffy in there and your face isn't getting steamed with hot pot broth. The backbone of the restaurant is in place to build something much better, and I definitely see the potential. Seeing as how this is just their soft opening, I'm hoping they'll work out and are here to stay. Best of luck!!"}
{"text":"I didn't actually want to have hot pot here at Xiang Zi after reading all the low reviews on Yelp. I've only decided to because my dad wanted to give it a try. The interior is very nicely decorated - it reminds me of those Chinese palaces in the olden-times . This place is very spacious but I felt like they wasted a lot of space by creating a huge hallway when you walk in. The service was good but it was over-staffed when I visited.   As expected, there were so many hidden fees!!  Expect lots of fees: * add money per person for hot pot * add money for one big pot or add money for each small pot per person * add money for \"better beef\"/ \"better food\"  We spent approximately $70 per person for hot pot. The food was okay, but not worth the money!"}
{"text":"***HIDDEN FEES!!! NOT RECOMMENDED***  So what kind of hot pot all you can eat is $38 per person but does NOT include the soup you need to cook the food. The quality of food was regular at best, not really anything special. That's right people! You're paying $38 but if you want the food cooked, you'll have to pay some more. The soup is an additional 6-15$ on top of that and get this, you have to pay a hidden fee for the sauce. No where was it noted on the menu or the table that you'll be paying extra for sauce. But for you non Chinese speaking folks, you may not find much English on the menu anyway... The staff barely speak English either and maybe it was just our timing, but we did not receive friendly service.  The manager knew we were complaining about the extra hidden fees and instead of coming over to handle the situation, he just cowards to the side away from us and refuses to come when we ask to speak with him. Zero sense of responsibility and just sends us another waitress to \"handle\" the situation. All they said was \"nothing we can do sorry. We know it's a hidden fee. People complained before but owners not here. Can't do anything\"... Wow..  Bottom line. Don't come here. There are some pretty amazing hot pot places in Markham that maybe don't have this fancy decor, but certainly offer better value and service. Money doesn't grow on trees, and even if it did, I would not be throwing my money here.  Can we hear a resounding \"Overrated?\""}
{"text":"Food quality 2 Spent too much money on interior.   Legend pot is way better.  That's all.   First time and last time."}
{"text":"SUPER LONG REVIEW!!! After seeing BlogTo's video I quickly decided to try there based on how beautiful it looked!  Service - 5/5 Environment - 4/5 Food - 2.5-3/5 Cost - 1/5  Theres many bad reviews on Google /Yelp , but I decided to give it a chance. General crowds reaction are still important regardless . Keep in mind I'm reviewing based on EVERY aspect of the place.  It's NOT good...BUT, its not bad. People need to stop overreacting and be fair. I'll explain further.   Saturday night they didnt have reservations for that day so they allowedwalk-ins (but some days they do take reservations ..?). Walked in being asked to wait for 45 mins but my friend and I ended up waiting just 15 mins. Their reservation system texted us and gave us 5 mins to confirm .   Weekdays are $34.99 while weekends are $38.99 per person , its all you can eat as well ! It's pricier than most common hotpot places but I can understand why, because it's a buffet-style and self-serving kind of place . What I find thats such a turn-off is the extra pricing of the broth , normally I don't mind but , spicy broth for $19.99?! Way too overpriced ! On top of that , extra fees for sauce per person as well ($2.50 per person so believe ), which is ridiculous ! The price per person was just fine to me , make it $40 per person if you have to but the overpricing of the broth and extra sauce fees is absurd. The other flavours of broth had different prices , ranges about $12-18 I believe !   EDIT : Spicy broth is $19.99 for one big shared one. Single small one (if you're in a big group I believe ) is about $7.99, Is what I'm reading online . Regardless , one big pot with split flavours are still extr pricey with extra fees  ALL THE MENUS ARE IN CHINESE .  I hope there will be an English menu soon , there's non-Chinese customers like me and others in the area, I understand many customers are Chinese but a secondary language would be helpful .   My waitress (cute short hair tomboy ) named Dan was very attentive and sweet , took her time to explain each category and options and menu for me ! It's a very busy place , all staff seemed to be pacing back and forth constantly, looking exhausted (it IS a new place afterall ) . My waitress Dan didn't rush , and was very patient in explaining everything carefully , even answered all of my questions , I kinda didnt want to impose on her. She was kind and also helped adding a sleeve on top of our jackets that's hung on the chair , the sleeve helps keep the smell away :) they also offer an apron to wear to keep away smell from your clothes !   Overall the experience is like a buffet , just be careful not to bump into others. Despite the extras and overpriced selects , the quality is OKAY. They're just like every other hotpot places honestly , like the supplies of frozen preps (some are fresh and some selections of cooked sides (like fried rice , stir fry noodles etc ) so I don't get why this place is so overpriced , I'm guessing to help cover the costs of all the hefty expenses they spent on to decorate this place haha. At least I can get a big handful of seafood without any shame or extra charges (many other places charge extra for seafood )   As seen in my other photo I ordered a \"premium beef\" (they also have higher quality of pork and lamb) on the menu for extra charges . I decided to try it out , Dan recommended me one selection (which is the cheapest ) for $8.99. It's marbled beef and just slightly more tender , I mean , IF they supplied these beefs in the station rather than the cheap T&T kind of frozen hotpot meats then I'm totally cool with the place being 34-38 bucks.   If you go in big groups you can have your own pot , if shared , the pot is bigger , extra fee if it's split broth, my friend and I decided to share the spicy brother. It contains massive amount of hot red peppers and other garnishes . Was quite spicy ! I believe you can choose a different level of pice but I didnt get that opportunity , just ask ! The octagonal pot was gridded into 9 grids   , which is pretty convenient so you don't have to keep searching for missing food.  The only complaint I have is the curled/gridded squid. (Theres other types of squid/cuttlefishes which is pretty interesting. Like the ring shapes and tiny cuttlefish-heads). But the curled squid was the most terrible quality ever ! They all have some sort of powdered substance on it and even after being cooked didn't taste like proper squid . I couldn't finish what I had from that.    Paid about $50-$60 per person (after tax , before tip ) . Got 10% off for grand opening.  Wouldn't mind trying again until they lower the costs !"}
{"text":"Came here with my friends. We were not happy with the price at all for the quality of the food. It was way too expensive! The service of the staff was not bad.  There were a lot of variety of food but it was definitely not clean. My husband and I came home having diarrhea. Not even kidding. I was not happy seeing the meat left out as some of it were iced and some were not. That causes bacteria and cross contamination! The price was VERY UNREASONABLE for this quality. I'm better off buying my own grocery and  hot potting my own at home.  Will definitely not recommend and WILL NOT COME BACK."}
{"text":"Overrated and way too expensive.  Got 12% for soft opening but still cost $60 a head with one non alcoholic drink.  Weekend price is crazy and the manager at the front even claims that I missed my reservation although I changed the time and reduce the number of guests over the phone.  Extra charge for soup which costs $5-$7.  Food quality and decor is good, but I ain't paying $60 for all you can eat hot pot.  I can have the same satisfaction with $30 all in just down the street"}
{"text":"Okay so this place can't get a 5 Star from me on principle alone. We came because some friends said it was amazing. And yes I agree the food is fresh, it has a great selection and it has like 5 types of tripe!!!! Anyone who knows me I LOVE tripe. Anyways, be warned. It costs 38 dollars for the all you can eat, and then 6 dollars plus for the soup, and then they don't tell you they charge you for sauce. Which doesn't make sense because if they charge you for sauce there should be the option to not get the sauce but it's on the buffet table. ? The place has really great tea as well. So while I enjoyed myself, if the price was 10 dollars cheaper due to those hidden fees I would 100 percent give this place a 5 Star."}
{"text":"Probably 2.5/3  Came here on a weekend night and was super busy. The interior was very identical and seemed like I was back in Chengdu.   Got seated on second floor, and the view was really good. However, if I could know the price before hand, I might choose to go somewhere else to have the same quality but better price hotpot.   The food variety was good, vegetables were fresh as well as the fruits, desserts etc. But when it turns to the taste, nothing stands out. We paid almost $90 after tax for a meal, and it looks like we paid mainly for the environment and renovations, not for the service or the food.   Anyway, won't be back again."}
{"text":"Ugh.  It wasn't worth the $60 per person. In addition to the $38 per person, they charged us $17 for the soup to cook the food. We are going to hot pot, of course we are going to order the soup!  While the selection was ok but for that price I would expect the crab, lobster, tiger shrimp, some cuts of beef to be included. If you normally eat all that for hot pot then you need to pay extra. Additionally, service was very spotty.  They set you up fast enough but then disappear for most of the meal. Took us over 20 minutes to find someone to get water and more tea.   Save yourself and don't bother with the place. I learned the hard way.   Warning to all those that want to use their non-Canadian credit cards to pay that exorbitant check they serve you at the end of the meal - they do not accept them.  Because the restaurant doesn't want to pay the transaction fee to accept the foreign card, we were forced to pay cash."}
{"text":"Food does not justify the price. unreasonable to have \"mandatory add-on prices\" for soup. Am I going to have hot pot without soup?!. If there's a base price, then it should include a basic version of the food for those who might want to give the restaurant a try but don't want to invest on all the bells and whistles of specialty soups, or high grade meats and seafood.   Pricing structure is also ambiguous in accordance to the English version menu provided. Not sure what's an \"add on\" and what's included. We were handed a menu and that was it. Should definitely have staff give the \"have you been here before\" speech before leaving customers alone to decipher the menu.  Do not wear fancy clothes here because the food smells will stick to your clothes and hair afterwards. the nice pillow case they give will help with your jacket but everything else will smell like the restaurant after you leave. (this goes for most hot pot/ kbbq places tho so its not a surprise)  Restaurant looks very nice but upper level diners would have to make their way down to the ground level in order to get the food back to their seats which can be a bit of hassle.   High marks on the looks, low marks for substance.  Price was the deal breaker for me.  Not the place I'd return to for hot pot."}
{"text":"****Hidden fees!! Hidden fees****  Restaurant decor is top notch. Looks beautiful. Big waiting area with benches. Great customer service !!  Lots of selection in food choices.   There are two floors. Downfall is if seated upstairs, you have to mission downstairs each time to grab food. Stairs are slippery. Felt oily I guess from the soup spillage. Be extra careful. Upstairs there are private rooms which is great! & also outside seating around the balcony overlooking downstairs.   Ventilation is not that great. Anyone with a baby or toddler it is advised that you leave them at home. Be forewarned Aroma is very spicy. My daughter kept coughing & choking.   Prior to going to the restaurant we made reservations & inquired pricing. Lady on the phone told us $38.99 per person. However there are hidden fees, $38.99 is the entrance fee. Depending what soup base you choose it is an additional cost. For example for the spicy soup base it is $7.99 ( which is the most expensive soup base on the list) for the individual pot. If not they have the big shared pot which is $19.99 each. On top of this a charge for the sauce of $1.99 is added. Also if you want higher quality for meat & seafood there is an additional cost. Oh forgot to mention they only have Chinese Menus no English. Thankfully the workers were nice and patient enough to explain everything to us.  I don't understand why they didn't include the cost of the sauce into the base price.    We ordered the spicy soup, medium level. Soup was extremely oily & spicy. Basically you're dipping your food in oil.   Overall give two Stars for the customer service and decor. First & last time coming here."}
{"text":"Xiang Zi Hotpot - where you get to pay $50 per person for the privilege of cooking your own meal. This restaurant is very expensive (a review of Xiangzi on Yelp isn't complete without remarking on the financial hit you will take).   The ambience is fantastic. Starting with the wonderful corridor you walk through to get in, it conjures up all the HK action movies I watched as a kid. Only less dusty. And with no martial arts master or evil warlord joining us for dinner. Also, you can spend a meal playing a delightful game of \"spot the references to the number 8\" in the design decisions throughout the restaurant.   A thoughtful floor plan, although guests on the upper level will need to walk a ways to the generous first floor buffet spread. A small touch, but the heating and electrical elements that power each table are hidden inside the table. Unlike other hot pot places, this means you won't be kicking any of that infrastructure while you eat. The heating element is super responsive to the control, and you can quickly bring the soup base to boil, or back the other way.   Props for having one of the most accessible washrooms I've ever seen in a Chinese restaurant. In addition to having a baby change table, they have an emergency call button, a and a fold down chair for a second child or a helper to wait.   Xiang Zi does the small touches really well. Aprons for covering you from splatter. Individual cans of sesame oil for the seasoning. A small side table with extra plates, bowls, napkins and utensils right next to the main table. Sectioned trays for easily bringing back the raw food. The choice of having a small individual bowls and a large group bowl is nice.   There is a good spread of raw and cooked foods. All the usual suspects and some more eccentric options: Chicken feet! Five (five!!) different types of tripe! And more liver, gizzards and tongues than you knew were edible by humans! There are extras you can buy which we were told are better cuts of meat. We didn't try, having already dropped too much money in the soup base.   In addition, there's a whole section of cooked foods, desserts and fruits. In the manner of a Mongolian grill, you also get a very extensive sauce section. And don't miss the (small) soup section tucked away in the corner.   Freshly squeezed watermelon juice was great. The $9.99 is for the entire jug (not clear from the menu, since other drinks are priced by the cup). If that's too pricey, you can feast on the cut watermelons on the fruit table.  There is some kind of VIP program, about which the less said the better.   In my view, the food, service and ambiance are as good as you can get in an AYCE hot pot. However, at this price point, you have to ask whether it's worth the premium. For $50 per person, all in, you can get 10 Big Macs for the price you will pay. On that measure, should you come here? Well, of course not. But if your reference point is McDonalds, this probably isn't the dining experience you're looking for anyway."}
{"text":"The food quality, service and the broth does not worth the price. I don't see why do I have to pay $20-30 more comparing to ordinary hot pot chain like moral village or Mongolian."}
{"text":"This restaurant tough me a lesson: nice decoration does not equal to good quality of food and reasonable price. The price per person is$35.99, but is all you can eat so maybe it is reasonable, yet, the broth takes extra $7.99/$15.99. Even the prices is higher than others, I still thought it is worth at first. BUT!!! The food are so *** (can't find a word to describe the bad &a not fresh) they put all vegetable like Lotus roots and potatoes out of the air, The lamb and the beef are not fresh too. The worst thing is the dishes, they put all of the dishes below to the table is easier to find but is not a good way to put like this! Over all I spent $62.** to have a dinner which makes me feel sick! And my stomach feels uncomfortable all day!"}
{"text":"Probably put a lot of money into the renovations and the price here is a bit pricier. About 38$ per person. I don't ever mind paying such price for good food. But seriously this place is a big disappointment and it's only grand opening? Food will probably go downhill or I pray that they will re-evaluate and upgrade the quality of their food.  There's not many soup bases to choose from and all of them are super salty. Each person gets there individual pot. This restaurant has all the food layed out for customers to pick what they want. Maybe the food has been sitting out for too long but even the quality of the meat is not that great. I'm highly disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Did I just go to this place without checking it out on Yelp first.  YIKES!  If you read my last review, you'll know what happened yesterday.  Okay, so my family came here last minute.  This place was super expensive!  My sister and I debated about it but given that it was Mother's Day weekend 6pm Saturday night and we had no reservations any where else, we just went with it.  This is an AYCE Hot Pot place.  All the food is located on the 1st floor.  We sat on the 2nd floor so it wasn't the most convenience spot but they only had two tables close together upstairs for the 8 of us.  Overall, it was actually quite nice not being so close to all the traffic of people walking around getting their food.  The decor of this place was pretty nice, almost felt like we were in China.  The service was really good, constantly clearing our plates.  It was also nice that they gave us a complementary pitcher of watermelon juice for Mother's Day.  As I mentioned earlier this place is way too expensive.  $38.99 per person which didn't include any higher quality of meats/seafood which would cost extra.  In addition, you have to pay another $16 for a pot of soup.  It included desserts which were mainly fruits.  We did like the shrimp, mussels and fish but for that cost, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Calling all hotpot lovers. If you love hotpot then this is the place to go!  Forget about Morals Village, Little Sheep, and other hotpot joints in GTA. This is the first ChengDu hotpot in GTA.   Price is a little higher up but the spicy broth is too good to pass up.   You go get your own vegetables, meats, and seafood.  If your feeling for seafood, this is the only establishment that offers U20 Scallop (the jumbo ones). As for meats, they offer thick cuts of beef tongue and beef slices, lamb and chicken.  But again the star is the broth. It's been about a week and I'm already thinking to go again this weekend.   Pro tip:  1) Make a reservation. This place is busy on weekends. 2) If you want better quality beef, you can order AAA ones but there's an extra charge. I'd say go for it if you have the $$$."}
{"text":"As a hotpot fanatic I have been to all the hotpot restaurants in the GTA, this place has to be the worst hotpot ever since Prince and Pastry Hotpot in China town. Most hotpot places have an identity, and stand out in certain aspects. Take Little sheep Mongolian hotpot for example, they have the best lamb out of all the hotpot places and they are affordable for everyone($25/person including tax+tips) . However, they have limited selection for soup bases and no premium seafood. On the other hand is morals village and legends hotpot. They charge a little more expensive but the overall quality of food is there, and a wide selection of soup bases. The service and decor is also very nice.   Now let continue on to xiangzi. Aside from the insane amount of money spent on its decor, every other aspect fails to compare to good hotpot places. Quality of meat is supermarket level, what u can get at any Chinese supermarket. The cold dishes appetizers are worse than what you get at T&T. Seafood that u can get from the bar is the worst u can find out of all the hotpot places. On top of the abysmal quality of food, the soup bases are expensive and have no real authentic spice and flavor. The place should charge half the price if it's going to be providing half the quality of food.   If you are looking for good lamb, little Lamb Mongolian is the place to go. If you are with a group, you would want to go to Legends pot and Morals Village for good decor, overall quality, and variety. If you want bang for your buck, go to Spicy Hotpot located at pacific mall, in addition to hotpot, they offer ayce Grilled seafood, which is included in the price. Yes, ayce grilled oysters, clams, squid, and big scallops! Quality is insanely good compared to hotpot places. I didn't mention authentic Sichuan/chongqing hotpot places b/c it's too spicy for people reading Yelp.   Hope it helps! Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Normal food, but a lot more expensive. When I walk into the restaurant, it's real cool because of the awesome Chinese effect they pull on. Super Chinese music, olden Chinese design... it just wows you. But... you can get any of the food for a cheaper price. 35.99 per person, plus another $5 for the soup base... yikes"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on blogto so we wanted to give it a try. This place has only been open for a couple of months.  The only pros I have here is the staff was friendly and nice decor.  Cons are they're over priced; charges per person plus additional cost for the pot of soup and dipping sauce fees. The menus were written in Chinese. No English; the only English was co-cola. We had the medium spicey hot pot. It was very oily like I was drinking oil from a deep fryer and soup base had no flavor. We sat in the private rooms and the floors were slippery. They have a upstairs seating area and you would have to go downstairs to pick your assortments; I did leg day the day before so the stairs wasn't that friendly. Would never go back again and would not recommend for others."}
{"text":"Came here with huge expectation, just look at the renovation, it brings back memories when last time I got to restaurant that spend so much detail in renovating the place. May be just too much detail on the decor and not enough on service nor food. The setup is all the food in the center for you to walk over and get your food, then you walk back and cook in your pot. Should have wear my sneakers... ladies especially if you sit on the second floor, it's a long way down and long way up. Maybe I'm just lazy and spoiled, got all used to people bringing me food, or is that the norm? Then why are we paying service charge if we are serving ourselves? The charge per person is certainly a bit more pricey than your average hot pot place. The spicy broth big pot I ordered taste like nothing I ever had before, especially the amount of salt in there was ridiculous, making it difficult to finish what I start eating without rushing for a drink of water to flush down the salt. So can't even comment the taste, as salt is the only thing I taste. I mean the place is crowded, you gotta line up to get in, they have a circle of stools for you to sit and wait, the decor is good but not the food."}
{"text":"Came here tonight to try out the hotpot and to be honest it's not nothing to be amazed except for the prices. We paid over 200 for 4 people and the food was meh. It was extremely expensive, I wouldn't come back again for something that I can get somewhere else for better price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not worth going to. It's a scam. The manager is rude and irresponsible. Way over charge and price is not clear. They hit you with hidden fee. Complained but they don't do anything about it Not like the food was any good. It was normal. I had other hot pot that are way better."}
