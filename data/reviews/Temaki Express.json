{"text":"Ordered gourmet white fish temaki.
The fish is ok fresh. 
The rice is not sushi rice.
Not authentic."}
{"text":"BOOOOO. Let me start off with the fact that I'm pretty relaxed when it comes to sushi joints, as long as the food tastes all right and I get it within a reasonable amount of time, I'm a happy camper. I went in with a couple of friends after work one night (with an appetite only maki could satisfy) and was pretty stoked to try out this seemingly awesome new place. We were the only ones in the restaurant and figured sweet, fast service! wrong. 

One friend ordered a salad and two rolls, the other two rolls, and myself the ceviche-uramaki roll. The salad came out after about 10 minutes by itself. 10 minutes after that, a roll came out which none of us had even ordered. The server took it back and after what seemed like an eternity brought out another roll (one that we had actually ordered). Basically the food came out very sporadically, which is odd seeing as how we were the only people there. When I FINALLY got the one item I had ordered, I was disappointed to see how bare it was. There was scarcely anything in it, perhaps a centimeter of flavourless cilantro in each piece. Despite how hungry I was, I couldn't finish it. And let me tell you, I'll eat anything. It was garbage. 

I could handle all of this, until another customer came in and while placing his order was offered the roll that we initially were given but hadn't ordered FREE OF CHARGE. Why the hell wasn't it offered to us?! It was such a slap in the face!

I think what bothered me the most is that the server's eyes were bright red if you catch my drift. Never ever ever going back. Temaki, you are a show-er, not a grower."}
{"text":"Even though there are a lot of restaurants on the Danforth, there aren't a lot of places to grab a quick lunch that aren't franchise places. I was excited to try this place when it opened, but didn't get around to it until fairly recently. 

I have no complaints at all about the taste of the hand rolls. I have had a couple of different version of the salmon hand rolls and they were both really good. I will say that having one hand roll isn't very filling and considering that one is around six bucks, it's not super cheap either considering the size. One would be like eating half a sandwich. You would have to buy two in order to fill you up for more than a snack.

I can live with the small portions because of the quality, but this one other thing turned me off. The first time I went in they gave me a card to eventually get a free hand roll after buying ten. I came in the next time and bought two hand rolls and they gave me one stamp. I asked them why I only got one stamp and they said the card is mislabeled and it's supposed to be a stamp with every purchase instead of every hand roll. That didn't make any sense to me, but okay.

I then asked if I bought one hand roll and then decided to pay for another if I would have gotten two stamps. They said yes. Okay, now I'm thinking they might be just incompetent. Why even bother giving out these cards then?

Flavours were good, but not good enough to ignore that the portion size and price didn't fit in my opinion. Throw in the ridiculous stuff with the card and it's probably not a place I'll choose to go very often."}
{"text":"Great handrolls, fantastic salad (love the sesame dressing) and considering the quality prices are really pretty reasonable. Lunch combos clock in at just under $10 pre-tax (one maki or handroll + side + beverage + cute little desert bite) and are pretty filling. 

Very inventive with the ingredients, just had a great almond+salmon handroll and, surprisingly, enjoyed a salmon and strawberry cream cheese maki a few weeks ago. Spicy scallop handroll is always good times though. All the ingredients seem very fresh and are definitely better-than-average quality. 

I'd call this the best sushi joint on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I was missing \"Brazilian sushi\" and Temaki for a while when I found out about this place. I ordered it by delivery and it came in less then thirty minutes. I ordered Maguro Tataki, Salmon Temaki and a Shrimp Temaki. They're really tasty like the ones I've eaten in Brazil! 
I just don't give five star because of the price, it was quite expensive and it wasn't so much food. If they had an All You Can Eat for a good price I would go there every time I could."}
{"text":"Good new sushi spot on the Danforth. Delicious hand rolls that are quite large. Flavourful miso soup. Also try the Brazilian dessert truffles for something sweet at the end."}
