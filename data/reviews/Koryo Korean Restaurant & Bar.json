{"text":"Ordered bulgogi bibimbap but pretty sure they gave me the regular bibimbap with ground beef. Anyway, the bibimbap was served lukewarm and the amount of beef in it was minuscule. None of the rice got crispy at the bottom. Extremely overpriced at $13.50."}
{"text":"Koryo is a new Korean restaurant at Yonge and Sheppard. It occupies the space where yogurtys and freshii used to be. 

The restaurant has a nice aesthetic with plenty of dark brown earth tones and ample use of wood and leather.  Overall, a comfortable place to sit and have dinner with friends and family. The service staff were also very attentive and friendly which added to making the dinner experience a positive one. 

We had the Samgyetang which, I believe, is a specialty dish of this restaurant. It is a whole chicken stuffed with rice, dates, chestnuts, herbs, and ginseng. I believe there are supposed to be some health benefits to some of these items - especially the ginseng. It comes in a soup that is literally boiling when it comes to your table. Also, you might find the soup somewhat bland, but we were told that no salt or pepper is added to the soup and that we could add it ourselves as there was salt and pepper available at the table. I felt this was a nice touch as it allows you to season the soup to your liking. Overall, the soup was quite good and definitely filling (it was a whole chicken after all). The chicken was tender and while it came in a soup, the meat was a little \"dry\" which is pretty typical of boiled chicken. 

We also had the Seol Long Tang which is a beef soup. I enjoyed this dish. There was plenty of beef and some tendon which was good. Once again, the soup initially came out bland, but this was easily fixed by adding a pinch of salt and some pepper to my taste. The soup broth had good texture to it and was just shy of having the sticky lip-smacking quality you might find in some ramen broths for example. Once again, another good dish. 

We also wanted to try the fried chicken, but unfortunately, they had none available. Therefore, we got the seafood and chive pancake. It was thicker than I was expecting and the pancake was somewhat chewy and doughy (is that a real word?), but the flavour was good.

In the end, I enjoyed my dinner and would like to return so I can try some of the other menu items (there is a fairly extensive menu). Prices are reasonable for what you get as the food is good, the restaurant is comfortable, and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Dinner w a friend on Thursday night. First time. Not too busy.
Ordered green onion and seafood pancake to start. Just like most Korean restaurants, this pancake was very oily. Had to blot with napkin. It was quite large and tasty, lots of green onion. We did not finish it as we were so full. Think it was $12.
I got regular hot stone bibimbap $13.50. My friend got chicken du bap. Both were tasty and had bit of modern twist with lotus chip and those white jelly things. Side dishes were ok, different and I was not used to them. Prefer the traditional side dishes. No kimchi. A lot of different radishes (I think). And a tiny romaine leaf salad? 
Slightly more pricey, but worth it bec  it had nice decor and modern vibe unlike the 'family' atmosphere of most Korean restaurants.
Service was no bad, similar to most asian restaurants. Had to ask for knife or scissor to cut pancake, they brought scissors.
Not super attentive, but not rude. They were great with splitting the bill and splitting the cost of the pancake between the 2 bills, appreciate that.
Would come back."}
{"text":"This place opened last Saturday and I think it's a pretty nice place. The place is really clean, cozy looking, and spacious.

I ordered the stone pot bibimbap. It was a big portion and I was definitely full. Their side dishes were also really good (and of course, free refills on those). 

The servers are really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had the beef bulgogi at this place . It was bland and dry. You can find better at take out. The chicken soup was tasteless and was a chore to eat. Place wasn't busy and I see why."}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner of 5 on a friday night. The female waitress that was serving us had amazing customer service - her alone would deserve a 5 star rating! Clean modern decor. Their bowls, cups, plates and cutlery is much nicer & higher quality then most reg korean restaurants. Loved the wide variety of food - didnt get a chance to actually try the fried items due to my cold but everything i had was tasty! Their battered honey and butter chicken was a huge hit as per my family!"}
{"text":"This is a new Korean restaurant and they specialize in Chicken Ginseng Soup. I came with my GF and we had 1 CGS and 1 of their special tonkatsu with multiple layers. 

I've had Chicken Ginseng Soup in Korea and nothing you find in Toronto will come close to that. I had it in a very famous spot in Korea where there are line ups even on random weekdays. In Toronto, in general the problem is lack of flavor, in particular ginseng flavor. And although Koryo specializes in this dish, their taste isn't that strong. They've added stuffing inside the chicken but the stuffing doesn't have much taste. Also, if I remember correctly there should be a chili sauce for the chicken. We did not get such a thing. If you go to Apgujung near Yonge/Steeles, they do the 3 course chicken ginseng soup and I find that version better than what's served at Koryo. Now...Koryo does have options where you can add things like Perilla seeds or abalone but I think the ginseng and chicken flavor is what make or break this dish. And the negligible amount of noodles they give you is like a joke.

The donkatsu is a layered version with cheese and spinach inside. After trying it, I kind of wish we just picked a regular donkatsu. I didn't find it very special. Go to Katsuya if you want the best donkatsu. Koryo's is not bad, it's just that it didn't blow my mind and it's more expensive than Katsuya's. It didn't even come with miso soup which is common for this dish.

This place has nice d√©cor. It's new and modern unlike more traditional places. Overall, would I come back? I guess if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was attending a course in the area so I decided to finally try this restaurant. I've ordered the beef bulgogi, the sauce was nicely done in terms of flavour, the beef was a bit tough, so I had to pick the small slices to eat. 

The side dishes you can refill. I did find the lettuce salad interesting where they used a sesame mayo dressing. The fish a peanut side dish was good too.

The food came fast and i was pressed on time so as soon as I food landed, I've asked for the bill. In and out only took me 35 mins. 

So I will give this a 3.5 and I will come back to try the abalone chicken soup!"}
{"text":"Really decent Korean food in the Willowdale neighborhood. I brought 2 picky eater friends here and they really liked it. Their banchan is actually my favorite. I find all Korean restaurants serve slightly different banchan in general. Some places offer sweet peanuts, others radish etc. Koryo has these yummy glass noodles which I think are made from potato and also spicy cucumbers that one of my picky eater friends kept eating. 

The two main dishes I have tried was a simple kimchi fried rice and also a soft tofu stew. Both were really pretty good in terms of flavor. I have to also add Koryo's atmosphere is really nice and comforting. The wooden interior and the lighting, super chill.

I'm sure there is tons of other Korean restaurants to pick from on that street, but Koryo is the closest to my work and they have not let me down so far. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really nice authentic place. Love the decor, very pleasant. Great service and attentive staff. We ordered two hot plate, seafood pancake and everything was delicious. Definitely recommend and will go back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the restaurant's 2nd location. The first one is located at Leslie and Bayview, this restaurant is at Yonge and Sheppard, right next door to Sushi One and Pizzaiolo.

The ambiance of the restaurant is modern and clean. 

They specialize in Samgyetang which is a whole chicken stuffed with ginseng and other herbs, simmered in broth served bubbling in a hot stone bowl. It is imperial cuisine (high class cuisine) so the prices aren't the cheapest you will find but the quality is definitely there and the taste is delicious. Proper samgyetang will come unsalted so that the person can control the amount of salt they want. Also, proper samgyetang does not come with red sauce to dip the chicken in - The King did not eat spicy foods, 'imperial Korean food' is not spicy. I take the salt and pepper laid out for you on the table and pour a bit on a plate and dip the chicken in that. Some people like to shred the chicken and pick out the bones in the soup and eat it like a chicken porridge. 

Their side dishes are all proper and very good. They are served in expensive brushed copper plates - exactly the way imperial cuisine should be served.  

I go often as its so close to work and I'm always in and out in 30 minutes. I think they have one of the best stone bowl bibimbaps in all of Toronto. Today I tried the raw beef stone bowl bibimbap and it was faaantastic. 

I would definitely go again and we do take clients out here at our company for some very traditional, upscale Korean food."}
{"text":"Great food but at the pricier side. We tried a variety of dishes and found all to be delicious. The fried chicken tasted great but the portions was a bit small. The portion of the \"soup dishes\" was perfect. The ginseng chicken soup was delicious and perfect for the cold weather in the winter."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of food. 

I was brought here by a friend who lives nearby of this restaurant. She recommended their chicken soup, which turns out to be really good. It's definitely a rare healthy option for dinner.

For me, I had the spicy pork bowl with rice. The bowl was huge and I couldn't finish the meal. It comes with a soup too.

I recommend both of the said dishes if anyone decided to give this place a try. 

I'd personally go back to try other dishes, as they seemed good too from the people that ordered those."}
{"text":"Really hate to do this since the servers were trying their very best to cater to our needs (e.g., asking us if everything was ok, being diligent about giving us water), but the food at this place was awful. Granted, we didn't order their signature chicken soup. That said, the dishes we got were really bad: the short rib patty was really salty and didn't have any other taste, while the chicken dupbap was the complete opposite in that it was really really bland. We thought it was just us but then overheard the people at the table beside us also complain about how bland their food was. I hope for Koryo's sake that they're just ironing out the kinks since they just opened recently. But if the best thing you can say about a place is that it's servers try their best to compensate for how bad the food is, I don't have high hopes."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken ginseng soup and soup was bland.  Had to add salt.  Selection was little and they didn't have pork bone soup or sweet and sour pork!!!  Pancake and fried chicken was alright.  The higher score was due to friendly service."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend and doesn't seem like it's super known yet which was great for us because we got seated right away. The service was great and food was delicious. I got the Hot Stone Spicy Pork Dupbap and it was definitely spicy but also full of great flavours. It came with this fried lotus root chip thing and I wish there was more because it was so good! The dish also came with soup and it definitely tasted herbally but that's how you know it's full of good stuff (my fellow Asians know what I mean, hahah). I know this area is filled with a lot of different Korean restaurants already but I would say If you're looking for a quick and tasty meal, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I remembered having chicken ginseng soup at their original location two years ago and really loved it... but now I've been spoiled by LA ktown, I wasn't sure how it would match up. 

Verdict - My chicken soup wasn't as milky as ones I had back in LA but still very tasty! The chicken was super tender and juicy. Loved the bursting sticky rice soaking up all the soup! Wished they threw in a couple more chestnuts for additional textual/flavor contrast. The ginseng flavor was so subtle though that I almost missed it. Good for those who aren't crazy about ginseng, bad for those who paid the extra bucks for them! Overall, still a 4 Stars in my book (just like the ones from original location). 

Aside from the soup, we also shared their seafood scallion pancake, pork tonkatsu, special seoluntang, and bulgogi beef dupbap.

Their seoluntang didn't taste like ones we had in la. My husband called it the fusion style? Tasty but not authentic. 

Seafood scallion pancake consisted of mainly scallions - Kinda small for the price and they forgot to cut it. Will probably skip. 

Pork tonkatsu - breading fell right apart when you pick up a piece - flavorless without the tonkatsu sauce. Guessed Tonkatsu was not their strong suit. 

Bulgogi dupbap - good flavor and generous portion of beef! Loved the sizzled crusted rice. Good alternative to those craving bibimbap but don't want all the veggies. 

Overall - not bad! Would stick to their chicken soups and sizzling rice bowls next! 

Tip for the winter months - Don't forget to wear an extra jacket or two, no heat in the dining room for even subzero weather."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Korean restaurant! I got the cheese tonkatsu which they call millefeulle or whatnot... A fancy way of saying layered stuffing. It had cheese in it and pork but didn't taste as different as I would have expected compared to regular tonkatsu. Still it was good. The bibimbap that I sampled was alright. Not my favorite bibimbap. Still I liked the soup they they included and the banchan was good as well. Their menu selection is more diverse than other Korean restaurants I've been to. The inside is also nice and modern. The service could be improved though. They don't really pay attention to removing empty plates or refilling water."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few of my colleagues a while back when it was still pretty new. 

Ordered the fried meat thing with the cheese and spinach inside.  It took forever to come out... and when it did... it was the wrong order.  I had to wait forever for the correct order to come out.  That's two forevers I had to wait! 

When the food arrived, it looked very nice.  But...

I can see what they're trying to do by putting the fried meat on the cooling rack, but the bottom was a bit soggy anyways.  It was a unique dish no doubt but it tasted just okay.  The cheese leaked out a bit and got stuck in the rack, and considering the portions ain't all that big, it was a struggle to scrape and eat all dem cheese bits.  3/5

When it was time to pay the bill, the waitress said something along the lines of \"is this the group that waited long?\".  Aw yeh it is!  So here I am anticipating some of that sweet sweet discount, but lo and behold... regular price.  :("}
