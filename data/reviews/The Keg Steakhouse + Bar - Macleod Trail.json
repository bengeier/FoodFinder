{"text":"I love the Keg. The staff is friendly, and make you feel welcome. The food is always delicious, although they seem to never get my steak right. Still a fan though!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Saturday for my Birthday thought we would have to wait at least half an hour they had us seated in no time. The server we had was awesome and really knew the menu. Our orders came out quickly. We had a great bottle of wine recommended by our server with our meal which was great. The free cake minus the silly singing and dancing you get at other venues was also a nice bonus for me."}
{"text":"I'm quite biased when it comes to steak, I'm not really a fan. My dining companions have been quite pleased when we have gone to the location in Stadium. I do recall them burning my 'well done' steak to a crisp one time, though. Also, I've been told their kitchen wreaks of rotten meat."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and consistent and the staff genuinely care about your experience the last time we went we made reservations for five people but wound up being seated at a table for four when we asked about why we did not receive a table for five people they said that they were very sorry but unable to accommodate however the manager did give us free appetizers for everyone and in all honesty the five people sitting at a booth was not that uncomfortable"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dinned at this Keg location a couple nights ago. The service was great and as always the food was amazing !!! You can never go wrong with The Keg when you're craving a steak."}
{"text":"Awesome service we had the prime rib and he sirloin Oscar it was cooked properly. Everything was perfect from the greeting from the host until the bill payment. We will defiantly return and try the creme brûlée it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Was here last night for a friend's birthday party.  Although I had no complaints about the food when it finally arrived, the service was at a standstill.  We had a table of 10.  We ordered before the table of 4 sat down.  The table of 4 received their appetizers and main before we we had our appetizers.  Not sure how that works.   2 hours to get served main.  I was livid. To add to the non existant service, they charged my friend for dessert even though it was her birthday.  I would not recommend anyone have their birthday party here.  There are other steak houses in Calgary that serve better food with less the wait time and will go out of their way to make your birthday feel special."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and each time the food was amazing! Staff were awesome and due to a large party delaying the kitchen we were given free appetizers.  They also gave me a free dessert for my birthday!! The key rocks!! Excellent service and food!!"}
{"text":"\"We brought some clients in , had aome cocktails, appertizers, dinner, and desert. Absolutely Phenomenal, --- Service and Food!\""}
{"text":"Excellent service.  I had a Chicago baseball sirloin that I thought was a bit tough.  We also had a shrimp cocktail and calamari.  The cocktail sauce had a definite horseradish taste bias.  The calamari was ok.  A relaxing time but the food wasn't good enough to make a return trip.  Bolero, which is only a couple of blocks away would have been about the same cost and significantly better."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Keg off and on now for almost 30 years, and rarely have I ever been let down. I am not a fan of the darker decor, but the food is generally great. Yes pricey, but great. I have always found the servers a bit pushy with the extras and desserts. 

If you do not want to take chances and want steak done right, this is the place."}
{"text":"Best steak I've had in Canada.  Baseball Top Sirloin was cooked perfect medium rare and very tasty.  Had wedge salad also excellent and asparagus was cooked just right.  This place rocks!  55 minute wait but bar had plenty of tables."}
{"text":"The only reason there is a star here, is the server who had us was a solid guy. Booked a section upstairs 2 weeks in advance. Needed a quiet space for a group meeting. 

When we show up they inform me our group is too small for the upstairs and they have relocated us to the \"sun room\"
Basically the brightest room in the restaurant, and also a small confined space. Full of people btw. 

The hostess can't answer our questions so they send the assistant manager. Her reasoning equates to not wanting to pay a server to work the upstairs. Fair enough, but how about a call within that two weeks. Just maybe a heads up that you cannot accommodate our request. Now we were stuck doing a planned presentation with no privacy. Too late to reserve elsewhere. 

Didn't even try and make it right with a discount or at its smallest.. an apology."}
{"text":"Ryan, our server, made all the difference tonight. The food was excellent, and, the service brought dinner to a totally different level!"}
{"text":"We had a reso for 8 o clock but understandably they were running behind,  so after a couple of drinks in the bar we were seated in the dining room at 825 pm.  The dining manager came and greeted us immediately after we were seated and offered our group of six, three appetizers of our choosing for the wait.  It was a lovely gesture!!  The rest of the dinner was delicious and the waiter was so friendly and just the vibe our table needed.  We ended up taking most of our dinner to go as we were so full!!  You definitely don't leave hungry and was a great atmosphere for our night out with friends."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I don't mind the Keg despite it being a chain. They normally offer good food and you get what you expect. Because it is higher end, the service is usually a little better than most other chains. Except at this location.

From the moment you walk in, the serving staff are running around in chaotic mode (this has happened on more than one occasion!). Trading tables, trying to figure out who has been seated where. It is stressful to watch while you wait. Our most recent visit was no exception.

Once we were seated, our server arrived and was clearly overwhlemed before she even filled out water. It was just starting to get busy but it was by no means packed. While throughout our meal she was friendly when she could get to our table, she was hardly able to keep up and was slow in coming by. She also was very soft spoken and had an accent, making it hard for most of ehr tables to understand her. I felt bad for her.

Our food was ok. Mine was really good (steak with a special limited time lobster medallion). My boyfriends however was less than great, with his steak having an odd mushy texture. He ate it anyway as we had waited a long time for our food (as had several complaining tables around us). He also had ordered a specialty coffee which while tasty, was ice cold.

Sorry but at Keg prices, I can't accept  only 1/2 meals being good and slow yet frazzled service. We didnt see a manager or senior server at any point...just a whole lot of dazed and confused servers trying to keep up."}
{"text":"I have never seen a lobster tail that was a 1/4 in thick. This is a joke. Over priced and over hyped by the staff. When the manager walks by your table and says \"your lobster doesn't look good\" don't eat it."}
{"text":"This location does not understand the concept of making reservations. The first time I was at this location was on a crazy Friday night. I opted to not wait in line and made a reservation on the spot for 3 hours later. When we arrived back they still had us waiting. So after waiting 20 mins we went into the lounge for drinks. Another 20 mins later, still no response, so we just ordered our food from the lounge. I'm not sure why I would have to wait over 40 mins with a reservation so late at night. The service wasn't all that great either.
Now a few months down the road, we got a gift card to this restaurant. I don't think we would've returned if we didn't. This time, we made a reservation in advance; still no table within 20 mins. I grabbed a business card for the manager there. The hostess saw this, so the manager came to speak with us. No, a 10% discount does not make up for our time. I would rather pay full price than rearrange my schedule around. If you can't accommodate to reservations, STOP TAKING THEM. There are plenty of restaurants that don't take them; I'm prepared to wait.

One star is for the friendly service from our server who was on top of things at all times. The other is for the consistency in serving good food. 

If you can, go to another location. I've never had a bad experience at the Keg on 4th Ave downtown. You may have to pay for parking, but the 10% discount that you save will cover those costs. On the plus side, it'll be less stressful."}
{"text":"This Keg was awesome tonight. We were served by Evelyn and were treated excellently. I tipped her very well too. The ladies in my party, ordered Medium rare Prime Rib and got it exactly as requested. I ordered Medium well and got it as requested.  The server made sure my drink was always full or taken care of. We were seated upstairs and only had to deal with noise from children.  I will return again."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad steak at this Keg restaurant. I always go for the sirloin oscar, but I do a classic dinner sirloin and add the oscar because I think there caesar salad is delish! The steak always comes at my requested medium rare and delicious mounds of bearnaise sauce with scallops and shrimp! I can never get enough. My fiancee always orders prime rib and loves it.

I like the atmosphere of the lounge better because there are no annoying kids and it's more quiet than the dining area. Once we went and were seated in the dining area and it was so loud and chaotic we asked to relocate,  which they happily did for us.

As for dessert,  their others might be good, but I wouldn't know because I'm totally addicted to Billy Miner Pie!!! Seriously it's so yummy and it's huge. The wait staff always give us strange looks when my fiancee and I both order one but it's just, epic. Never have we wasted one bite :)

When we want a nice evening out, The Keg Macleod it is!"}
{"text":"Booked a reservation for my father's birthday and called the day before to confirm our table. The night we arrived, they were unable to find our reservation and we had to wait 45 minutes. Once seated, we were informed they ran out of three dishes, which included the prime rib, sea bass, and another main that I've since forgotten. Two of us specifically came to The Keg in hopes of ordering the prime rib, so that was a disappointment. A couple of our steaks came out over cooked when requested a medium and medium-rare."}
{"text":"This particular keg location is consistent and the service is usually great. I eat here about once a week and the steak or burgers are great and if you are not satisfied the manager will make up for their mistake with a new portion or something to substitute."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight, I ordered the teriyaki chicken with a side of rice pilaf. My wife had a spinach salad and added chicken to her salad. My son who is eight years old ordered off the kids menu. He had the 1/2 rack of ribs. The meal comes with sourdough bread at the start. Also the kids meals come with a small plate of veggies and dip. If I were to say anything negative about the meal, it's that the chicken that accompanied my wife's spinach salad was a little on the small side. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated with landscape art and some framed photos on other walls. There is a separate bar/lounge area. I remember when this place use to be a nightclub back in my single days i think it was called JR Houston's. 
In wrapping up, our waiter's name was Alex and he was very good. The total came to just over $50.00 without tip."}
{"text":"The Keg on Macleod is my favourite. The staff is always accommodating. Both my daughter and I have a surverve dairy allergy. It makes eating out challenging. I have never had a problem after eating at the Keg. They promoed our drinks, because they forgot 1. It was very appreciated. Will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Five reasons I like this restaurant: good seating order during busy hours, casual but variety of  choices from pork/steak/lamb to seafood, just fine pace of courses serving, friendly services and finally reasonable price range for family dinner place. I recommend."}
{"text":"The first time I've been to the Keg ever and I was completely blown away with their EXCEPTIONAL SERVICES. I came with my bf because he was hungry. I was not planning to order anything but I couldn't resist food so I order a casual plate of steak. It came out well-done instead of medium which I ordered. I was gonna let it slide but my bf insisted on talking to them. So we called Jose(our server) over. He apologized and left with the plate for a new order. 2 mins later, his manager came over to apologize. He asked if we were okay to wait another 10-12 mins for new order because my bf had finished his food, or he could exchange it for something else. We said it's ok. 10 mins later, the manager personally bought the new plate to us. The food came out perfect, even my bf said it was good (he doesn't like steak). Both Jose and his manager came to check on us. They fixed their mistake, went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. They didn't even charge us for the steak order. Where else can you find such an extraoridnary service?"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Good atmospheres. A little bit too pricy, but it's a great place for celebrating the anniversary."}
{"text":"We came here for a date night and had a lovely evening. The wait for a table without a reservation was long, about 30 mins. It was intimate and dimly lit, which we loved and found it very cozy. For appy we had the garlic shrimp, it was fantastic but we expected the portion to be larger for the price. The wine selection was great and the waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. We both had the bacon wrapped filet mignon w/ blue cheese and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection and although I generally dont care for blue cheese all that much, this was outstanding bc they had creamed the cheese and paired it with 3-4 roasted garlic cloves which took the edge off and gave it a really rich and beautiful taste. The creme brulee was large enough for us to share and very very tasty. The pricing was a bit much. We had a $100 gift card, otherwise we would not have chosen this location. I would come back for dessert and a glass of wine, but our preference will still be Vintage Chophouse for THE BEST steak in Calgary. There is no comparison between the two so if Im spending a lot of money, its going to be downtown @ V."}
{"text":"I been to keg so many times and yesterday I was quiet disappointed. I ordered sirloin Oscar yesterday, the presentation was terrible. I did ordered 8oz of steak not sure they were 8 or 6. Food was ok. I ordered medium rare and it was medium. To be honest I like your creme brûlée a lot and it was not disappointing. Please, inform your staffs when they about to serve please do present nicely. My food looks like surf and turf."}
{"text":"What can I say!? Way better experience than the last time we were here. Really, really good.
We arrived just before 3pm at a weird time for a late lunch but it was amazing to have practically the whole place to ourselves! No noise other than the tunes, no one next to us, and had the bartender/waiter to ourselves. Andrew, you outdid yourself today. Your welcoming manner, your exuberance and your love for what you do was obvious. Thanks for taking great care of us!
The mushrooms neptune were yummy as was the steak sandwich we ordered to share- perfectly rare and not overdone - most other places do not do it properly. Loved the button mushrooms on the side, they were well seasoned! We were told that the dayshift cook was the best!
My only teeny comment was the bread seemed over-micorwaved a bit - a little tough but we did not come here for the bread, it was just a bonus!
The drinks were good and we had a very nice time overall! What a great feeling to be able to park so close to the door for a change in a Keg parking lot. I think we should come here for late lunches more often!
5 stars for today's visit!"}
{"text":"We are in Calgary a half a dozen times per year and cannot stay away from this place. Although The Keg is a franchise the crush it when it comes to turning out excellent food and great service. I have not had a bad experience here and I highly recommend you go check them out!"}
{"text":"We came in for an early supper. Driving all day and my hubby was so hungry, might as well go someplace we know the food is good. Apparently, if you go to supper at 5 they like to use the lunchtime leftovers.

We started with a Caesar salad and calamari, The salad was brown and mostly stems, and the calamari was mediocre at best. It was flavorless and undercooked. Lightly fired should at least be slightly crispy.

My hubby ordered the BBQ chicken and ribs. Both were VERY dry and had no flavor.  The did come with two small containers of BBQ sauce, which came with a nice think gooey skin on top.

I ordered the teriyaki sirloin , cooked medium, and shrimp. The steak was not teriyaki and was char burnt on the outside. Despite the burn, (and me dying of hunger) I ate the first the first third of the steak, it was cooked medium. The rest rapidly progressed to rare.

Our waiter was was nice as he could be, and did remove the brown salad from our bill.

I'm just so disappointed, I won't come back here again."}
{"text":"I usually try and avoid chain restaurants, but we went here because we had a gift card and I must say it was a wonderful experience. Our server was excellent. Very attentive and helpful. I started with the Ruby Soho cocktail which was delightfully refreshing and adorned with a sprig of rosemary. We shared the bacon scallops and they were the highlight of the entire meal - cooked perfectly and full of flavour. Only downside was you only get 6 scallops in the order. My husband ordered the baseball cap steak with wedge salad and double baked potatoe and really enjoyed everything. I wasn't feeling like steak so I tried their new vegan entree, a cauliflower 'steak' with sundried tomatoes and chickpea. The cauliflower itself was grilled but nothing special as far as seasoning/flavour but the sundried tomato chickpea on top was fantastically flavorful and took the dish to the next level. It also came with some asparagus which was nice. This dish was the perfect amount of food and left me with some room for dessert so we shared their mocha ice cream pie (which I saw someone else eating as we walked in and knew we had to try it) and it did not dissapoint. It's massive and covered in chocolate and caramel sauce but because its ice cream it's not as filling as other desserts. It went perfectly with an Irish Coffee. We left very happy with our experience at The Keg. It really was high quality food and service for the price."}
{"text":"Really good service. Had the half rack of ribs, and size of the ribs was small with barely any meat."}
{"text":"A Keg is a Keg is a Keg.

Want a steak? They've got those. Want some seafood? They've got some. What about chicken? Yep that too. Your traditional Canadian fare cooked to a level above the average. It's a nice place to go when your guests are not very interested in trying anything new but still want a good meal at a decent price. This location doesn't break away from that norm. The Keg still makes a pretty reliably good steak and I refuse to try anything else (well the prime rib is good too).

Steak? Yep, and at a decent price too."}
{"text":"I really can't complain. Maybe a few times I've had below average service but tonite was great. We sat in the bar tonite and had a great dinner!! We went around 5pm and it started filling up fast!! By the time we left (around 7) there wasn't a table in sight. I really noticed how they don't over price their wine. Chatted with our server about it too. Had a bottle of J. Lohr cab sav for $40. In the store it's a $25 bottle, so not a crazy up sale by the Keg."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good customer service, phenomenal food but Jesus Christ. The TV's in the lounge are HORRIBLE. How about stepping up your game and replacing the dingy 32\" screens for something more appealing. It's a lounge. Meant to entertain guests not meant to bring them back in time."}
{"text":"Me and my son dinned in at the keg tonight.usual when I'm with my son I don't get very good service,we tend to get ignored.well this keg was great service as well as our steaks came out perfect.what really noticed and really appreciated was the floor manager ,He was by far awesome.
He checked on us quit a bit making sure our food our experience was good.We will be back to this only for now on.Thanks for making my dinner with my son so amazing."}
{"text":"Beef. Value. Service.Free Parking.

Needed a centrally located spot for a lunch meeting...The Keg - why not. And, I am really working to get out of the downtown hustle to a place with ample and free parking.

Over the years the Keg has maintained a menu that has something for everyone while delivering in a nice atmosphere with ample staff to meet the lunch rush.

Both of  us had the steak sandwich and the food arrived as ordered, hot and tasty. The Keg's approach seems to be \"keep it simple\" - after all, why do you want mess up a nice piece of beef with sauces and flavours that do not belong?

I'll be back as the server was prompt and efficient and showed up at the right time with water refills etc."}
{"text":"Consistent good.

Always a good steak (med rare no chance for a burn), my friend had a good birthday treat.

If you dont want to over think a place and just want to get some good food dip your toes in."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent steak and a great ambiance.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but you really can't knock these guys - if you want great food and a good night out, this is a safe bet!"}
{"text":"It was our almost monthly \"cousins' dinner\" and I chose the Keg. I like the reliable consistency. We all had beef and all had great meals. Mine was a steak and seafood special - yummy. And you can't beat the Billy Miner ice cream pie for dessert."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely packed and I suppose it's to be expected on a Saturday night at 6pm.  The wait for a restaurant table was 55min but somehow our party of three snagged a table beside the fireplace in the bustling lounge and didn't wait at all.  It was a small miracle.  We ended up with great service despite how busy it was.  

The noise level was unfortunate.  The music was too loud as far as I'm concerned, so patrons didn't have much choice but to turn up the conversation volume.

I had the Chicken Oscar and it was great.  I do wish there would have been a bit more sauce though, as there only was enough to accompany about half of the chicken.  The mound of garlic mashed potatoes on my plate was just massive.  My spouse said he's had better steak here.  I guess he didn't get a very good cut, as it was kind of tough and gristly.  He's usually really excited about Keg steak, so I was disappointed for him.  

All in all the experience was okay and they still gladly provided a free desert to someone celebrating a birthday, which is why were were here."}
{"text":"They make good steaks but...
I'd give them a better review if they hadn't made us wait 15 minutes, when we had a reservation.  There are \"seaters\" all dressed up in suits running around with their heads cut off, and they seem to disappear for minutes at a time.  And then we got seated upstairs (I didn't even know they had an upstairs) which was being monopolized by some russian group party ordering vodka shots.
So it was okay, but I've experienced better..."}
{"text":"Shockingly bad service. Waited ages. Generic stakehouse decor. Generic stakehouse menu. Incompetent and inflexible kitchen. Waiter was about 12 years old and rude. I don't understand the high reviews. Try Caesars or Buchanan's if you want a good stakehouse experience."}
{"text":"Well three and half stars really. Good service. Starters were all interesting and stood up to their discription. Mains? All good, steak cannot fault, cooked as ordered and on a warm plate. That tells you that the restaurant understands food! Not always the case in other places. Thought that the steak was a tad under sized. Also did not expect the steak seasoning. That a good move. My guests had a salad mains. Tad short on the meat part on the salad dish. 
The sweets. Awesome.
General venue and settings good. Bench seat a tad close to the table I thought. Maybe a tad expensive than it should be. However I enjoyed my meal and so my guests."}
{"text":"Best steak place for ever! The Service was excellent. I satisfied with every things there. Highly recommended for you."}
{"text":"The Keg is one of my favourite pet peeves so I'm biased here, sorry...

I mean, yeah, a number one steak experts - and so common around that if there's a Canadian Tire or Petro Canada in sight, there must be a Keg nearby.

Seriously, no one must expect quantity converting itself in quality. In all fairness, things go the other way around.

But you know what - I still do believe that maybe once upon a time young and ambitious chef will actually impress the Keg public with some unheard of steaks. And maybe I'll be there that exact moment, and would actually enjoy a wonderfully prepared meat...

Why young? Because I'm yet to see a seasoned master chef working for a chain. I mean, chefs have their professional growth strategy, and cooking standard menu items forever definitely doesn't look aligned with anything seriously desirable.

So for MacLeod Keg, three stars is a good rating. Steak was plain and ordinary. Once again I glanced across the \"other plates\" part of the menu, trying to imagine how good those may be? Once again I decided not to go for a dessert. Not because I was full, but because the main course price bite way too much from my per diem.

Servers were young, not quite attentive - but polite and friendly when they do notice you. Otherwise, just another Keg. Like another McDonalds, or Tim Hortons. Maybe at the end there's nothing wrong with ordinary things?

But I just want magic to happen. Silly me."}
{"text":"As always, fantastic service. Food was excellent. This chain is always reliable. I've rarely had a bad meal. This visit was no exception. 

Cocktails excellent, wine choices excellent, food was great and service was perfect. The restaurant was a little warm for my taste. Other than that it was a perfect score."}
