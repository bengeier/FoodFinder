{"text":"I think it was good, the red meat special tamales are AMAZING. I, however, had the mini appetizer which consisted of 3 mini tacos, 3 mini toastada and 3 mini burritos. The salsa they make isn't that good for them to be selling it to take home but that's IMO."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to eat Mexican food. You get a lot of food for a low price and everything is good.   The chips and salsa is amazing! Love this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! The perfect hole in the wall mexican food restaurant. I have grown up coming here and it is always DELICIOUS!! The staff is always super nice and don't get mad when you ask what something is! I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Suggested this place today to my foodie friend. 1st time for the both of us....n unfortunately, probably the last. The chips(fresh n hot) n spicy salsa(in the squeezy bottle)...off to a good start. Service was typical. The beans and rice were nothing special.  Atmosphere was cute, tiny thou. Overall... food was rather overpriced."}
{"text":"A Mexican friend of mine introduced me to Pedros, saying the food was just like his mother's.  (Which could be a compliment or concern; my mom can't cook at all.  Apparently his can.)  Each time I go here, I have good intentions to try something different, but I always end up getting the chicken tacos.  Sometimes I'll mix it up and get a tamale or a shrimp taco with my chicken taco, but generally... you can't go wrong with the chicken.  It is tender, and incredibly flavorful.  I wan to work here just to learn how they cook their chicken.  The chips are bottomless and fresh.  The salsa is a build-your-own kind of thing: they provide the pico base, always full of fresh tomato, onion and cilatro flavor.  Then, if you like a little more spice, you can add some home-made hot sauce to taste.  And, if you're brave, you can request the chunky salsa which, if added liberally, is kicky enough to make the people a table over cry.  My parents, whenever they come to town, insist on visiting Pedros.  Mom swears by the wine margaritas.    Service is always friendly and efficient; instead of one server, everyone working takes care of every table.  So your water glass doesn't stay empty long.  I could go here weekly, and never get tired of the food.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, I haven't been to every Mexican restaurant in the valley, so there is the (remote) possibility that there is a better place.  But I doubt it."}
{"text":"i've been to tons of mexican restaurants in az.  this is good, authentic food. the portions are large. the sauces are different and tasty. they have good lunch specials ranging anywhere from $5.50-$7.00. the place is very small. you could be waiting a while if it's busy. it's cramped. if you're looking more for a fancy place or large place, this isn't it. because it's so small, and when i went today it was packed, the service was very slow. but if you're looking for really good food, pedro's has it."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pedro's since I was just a little girl, well over 30 years now, we would go at least once a week with the whole family...kids got to sit at a table alone!! Only because the adults couldn't stand us when we were all together!! ;)  The food is great! I have never had a bad meal there! The establishment has always been very small, so if you are planning on eating there with a large party, I suggest you call ahead and make reservations!! The prices are reasonable and service is quick.  You can also just call in your order and get it to go if you are not interested in dealing with the small environment and being elbow to elbow.  They do get busy on Fridays and Saturdays.  I would love to see them do some updating inside, it is very dated and dark.  The food is always consistent in looks and taste.  I always order iced tea and they bring a glass already filled and a little pitcher of iced tea as well!!  The chips and salsa are very good, one of my favorite salsas out there!! A must try!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for more years than I'd like to admit. The service is great, the food  Is great, and the ice tea is the best anywhere!  You can get a beer when you have that in mind. THE BEST chips and salsa!!! They have great deals for lunch..and offer a \"punch\" card for meals bought and after 10 get 1 free! Where does that happen anymore. We will be back. More times than I'd like to admit! Stop in and you'll agree!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pedro's since I was a little kid. I absolutely love their food and I rate it at the best Mexican food in AZ. They have amazing food and a great selection. The chips and salsa is also very good. The chips are made fresh everyday. The staff is very friendly and the service is very fast. I love Pedro's Mexican Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yay! Another place that provides us with free chips/salsa/hot sauce stuff when you sit down! Sweet. And that salsa is VERY good. We had to request more two times by the time we were finished chowing.  Lunch is terribly busy, but they take it in stride; the service is fast and courteous.  Every time I go there, even if I order a la carte, the food fills up the plate. It is pricey for lunch IMO, but I am kind of a cheapskate so take it with a grain of salt if you want.   My only problem with this place is as follows: The staff does not know whether lard or animal broth is used as ingredients. So I had to gamble. I lost. The server told me to get green sauce for my burrito because the red sauce had animal broth, but the green sauce tasted like chicken. So next time I will have my burrito without chicken sauce and hopefully I won't taste it in the beans.   Anyway, I will be back. Even the lardiest mexican restaurant has bona fide vegetarian food, and I have to have some more of those fabulous chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Prices  I live in east mesa and drive here at least 2 times a month  it is about 45 miles one way.   The Nachos are expensive but are worth every cent.  If you ask they will bring you their HOT salsa  it is excellent.   Other than Meguiels in San Diego, It is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant.  6 hours is just to far to go for my Mexican fix.  Do your self a favor and try this place out.  But be prepared  sometime there is a wait it is a pretty small place inside.  Top notch service also."}
{"text":"Love this place for home cooked Mexican food it's a must if your in the west side of town . Just ask for hot sauce"}
{"text":"My girlfriend has been going to Pedros since she was 12 and always raves about this place.  I decided to try it recently and absolutely loved their chips and salsa.  I ordered a taco combination plate for my meal and the tacos were excellent.  They also have the best tamales in the world, or so my girlfriend says.  We will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I just luv the food here..Its absolutely amzing !!! I have been here -3 times now and havent been disappointed even once...The enchilladas rock !!! They are closed on Sundays and coinsidently i always have a craving for their food on Sundays..I drive to Pedros on sunday afternoons forgetting they are closed...Thats how gud their food is !! Trust me !"}
{"text":"I only make it all the way over to Pedro's about once a year but we went today and it was as wonderful as ever. I always ask for a bowl of their chunky salsa and then add the hot sauce that is on the table and it is the freshest, most delicious salsa around.  We got the regular size chips, cheese, and jalapenos nachos for eight dollars and it was as cheesy and huge as I remembered.  I read the review concerned about the silverware being near the bathrooms, but the closed door you see leads to a little hallway, and THEN to the bathroom which also has a closed door.  Everything seems clean to me!  I can't wait until I need to be on this side of town again!"}
{"text":"I don't know how a lot of the people on here could claim that Pedros is mediocre or less than. I guess to each their own. I have gone to Pedros 2 times so far. The first time I went I will admit I was a little hasty about eating there based soley on how the place looks. It isn't your everyday run of the mill chain mexican food restaurant. But once my food arrived it melted away the appearance of the restaurant. I had ordered the shredded beef chimichanga with the San Marcos on top with a side of rice. Let me tell you, it is AMAZING!!!! I have eaten a lot of mexican food and they by far have some of the best food in the valley. There was a guy who commented on how the salsa is \"sweet\" and \"sweet salsa is no good in his book\" Ok, the salsa is sweet, but not bad. The hot sauce is awesome, mix the 2 you can't go wrong. And what's really funny is how my boyfirend and I can never even finish a basket of their delicious chips because our food is always so quickly prepared that we didn't have the time to finish them (regretfully). The ladies who work there might not be starbucks friendly, but they do make sure you have everything you need and that you are taken care of. If you are looking for great food at a great price then Pedro's is your place to go. I don't know if I could eat mexican food anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Great family-run place in Glendale. Crowded on a Sat afternoon. I was driving otherwise would have tried the wine margaritas. 1 liter was only $10!  Couldn't be that bad for the price. Had the red beef burro and E had the veggie tamales. We were both satisfied with the meals and price."}
{"text":"Bad services never going back didn't even get to eat there.tables are small wanted us to seat at a small table we couldn't fit there moved to a bigger table told us if we wanted to seat there we had to hurry up and eat in 15 mins wtf who says that shit..."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pedro's for over 20 years. This place is outstanding. From the chips and salsa to the sopapillas you can't go wrong. I typically get the stuffed quesadilla, the best in the biz. However, everything is good.   Also, ask for the pico de gallo to spice things up a little. They don't bring it to the table unless you ask for it but it is awesome. Great with chips or on your meal!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The name Pedro's always seems to come up when searching for good Mexican food in Phoenix, but I never quite made it there due to its proximity to where I live and work.  That changed the other night when my friend convinced me to go car shopping with her and we passed it while driving to the dealership.  After a long, frustrating process at the dealership (what car buying experience doesn't fit that category) we were hungry and her baby needed to eat so we wanted to go somewhere close by, so we thought we would give it a try!    It was about 7:30 on a Monday night, and there were about 5 other tables of people that seemed to be regulars.  We weren't sure what to expect from the outside of the building, and its location, but inside was clean with some kitchy decor.  The menu was vast and had all my favorite dishes...it was so hard to choose!  Ultimately I got a combo plate that included a bean tostada, cheese enchilada and a shredded beef flauta with beans (I opted for no rice).  The chips that came out first were delicious, hot, crisp and lightly salted, they were some of the best I have had.  The chunky salsa was good, but a bit on the sweet side, but it was perfect once I mixed in some of the hot sauce.  I really liked how they have you little bowls for your salsa, plates and salsa just don't mix!  The food came out fast and was piping hot....I tested the beans, my benchmark for Mexican food, and they were delicious!  Creamy, salty and rich, they were really good beans!  The enchilada was good, but I did feel the sauce was a bit on the thin side.  The beef in the flauta was delicious, really flavorful, it didn't even need sauce!  My friend had a burrito that she also enjoyed.  Our pit stop at Pedro's was made out of desperation, but we walked away happy and satisfied and considering a return trip.  When we paid the cashier told us that they had been there for 51 years, I hope I make it back before they are there another 51 years!"}
{"text":"Love this place, food is always good, staff is always friendly and efficient.  My mate had the shrimp tacos . He shared a bite with me and as much as I love the chili rellanos, I wish I had ordered the tacos. Yum"}
{"text":"Went to Pedro's for dinner while in town on vacation.  The food has got to be the best mexican food we've ever had!!  The wait staff was very helpful and explained some of the finer differences in the dishes and ingredients.  They also shared waiting on the tables, thereby providing excellent service to all.  Price was just right for the amount of food that you get, and the menu was extensive.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will definitely make it to Pedro's!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for 17 years and we have NEVER had a bad meal or service. Their hot sauce and chips are amazing. Try the chunky hot salsa too!  You never run out of chips or salsa because the wait staff is on the ball! The chicken they use for their food is delicious. They cook it with tomatoes and green chiles. It's a totally casual hole in the wall restaurant but they make very good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pedros since 2011 and its great every time. It's old school Glendale Mexican comfort food. Yes it's dark and seems dated inside, but that's because it is both of those things. As long as that doesn't dissuade you, it's a must try."}
{"text":"best cheese crisps ever - this hole in the wall is hands down, a great place for all things mexican...."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican place, I got a Green Shredded Beef Chimi for dinner and it was delish.  Small joint and the table we got was kinda cramped.  Service was good.  I liked the old style decor because this is not like all the boring chain restaurants you see today in the valley.  They kept our table full of chips and salsa, which the salsa was ok.  Overall, a real good experience.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 is we were cramped, most tables/booths didn't look this way, but some booths did.  I will go back and try their fry bread which was nice to see on the menu.  03/27/2009-  I did get to go back and try their fry bread, It was really good, and both times I got really good service, what I forgot to say in the earlier review is that they use real Guacamole, yum!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was crowded when our party came in for lunch. Service was friendly enough and the food was brought quickly. My problem with the restaurant was that although the food was pretty good, there are much better Mexican places around. Some of the items seemed a little on the pricey side for a small restaurant like this. I had one of  the lunch specials, a bean tostada"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of real Mexican food, don't miss this place. And in addition to the food being awesome, the service is friendly and lightning quick, and it's so inexpensive. Pretty much the ideal lunch stop."}
{"text":"Everytime I am in town I come here with the family it is really good and I believe it is the closest to authentic mexican food that you will find in Phoenix. I live in San Diego and so far this place is right up there with a lot of the mexican food places out here. Now if only they had california burritos here we would be set."}
{"text":"Sorry but food was not worth it chicken burrito reminded  me of why I disliked chicken in the past."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The salsa served with the chips is amazing. Chili rellenos and the carnitas plate are both good choices here. Was in Glendale for a baseball game and looking for a quick bite to eat and decided to give it a try based on the reviews. Let's just say they were spot on. I'll definitely return when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time with my girlfriend. Food was mediocre at best, service was subpar."}
{"text":"I'm unsure how this place received really good reviews. Good food but honestly it seems like a chain restaurant taste value not a mom & pop authentic taste value.  What I mean by that:  Salsa was watered down with no flavor or kick to it - at all. Tried the Fry Bread Delux with Green chili Pork and it, again, tasted watered down with little flavor and no kick - at all. I was actually adding salt to my salsa and fry bread for flavor. Usually, in AZ., the local authentic taste has delicious flavor with a kick to it.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking to get my socks knocked off. But I am expecting flavor with a little kick.  Service was okay. Not friendly but not rude either. If I were to recommend this place, it would be to someone unable to handle the true kick of authentic Mexican food.  This would be right up their alley."}
{"text":"Best shredded beef in town, especially with the San Marcos sauce.  Love the salsa (I mix the two together for chunky-good flavor).  Family owned.  Feels like a hole in the wall.  And not too pricey.  LOVE IT!  Favorite Mexican food restaurant in town.  Everybody we have taken here raves about it!"}
{"text":"Reply 10/24/16  I don't recall the exact date that me and my family were at the business. It was approximately 1 month ago on a Saturday during mid afternoon."}
{"text":"I was going to take my Mom to Pedro's today...Closed on Sundays:( I have been to La Perla down the street before..Not my first choice but...we ended up there...WORST FOOD AND WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!  I will never make the same mistake...Pedros...You guy's are awesome and really take care of your customers...Thank you"}
{"text":"Pedro's fine Mexican food, absolutely the best in the west. I've been going there for 29 years and every time is a pleasure."}
{"text":"I am a businessman. After a long day of business, I have quite an appetite. I also often need to fuel up for the next day's business. Well, lo and behold, Pedro's has just the meal. It was fantastic. First, Tim G. is right. The salsa is bomb. And the beef, while not shredded as Shane A. says, is bomb. But I digress. Back to the business person's special. I recommend the beef burro with green chile salsa. It is fantastic. And bomb. As Sharon M. says, the mini taco salad is bomb. The beans were creamy. Although she couldn't finish it. She is not the business person I am.  We also learned the story of how the business person special got its name. It was a hot July day on 1972. A tall, dark, and handsome man sauntered in to Pedro's. He wore a large hat, a bolo tie, boots, and a thick mustache. In a deep voice, he explained he had just finished a long day of business and had quite the appetite. He ordered a beef burro, and quickly ate it. While delicious, he was not yet sated. \"How about one of them tacos,\" he bellowed. The business man made quick work of the taco. Still not satisfied, the business man asked for a cheese enchilada. \"Dios mio,\" said Pedro. He had never seen someone eat so much. Pedro hesitantly obliged the stranger, and watched in awe as it was consumed. Finally satisfied, the business man stood up, left Pedro a silver dollar as a tip, and proudly walked into the sunset, never to return again. The legend only grew, and the stranger's meal remains on the menu to this day."}
{"text":"Pedro's is my favorite restaurant ever!  My family and I go there all the time.  Their green chili is the best.  I like to mix their salsas."}
{"text":"Pedro's is a staple restaurant for my family and I. We make it a point to go every month when one of us is in town or more often if we can. The place is amazing. Service is always quick, with a smile, and i have never had a bad experience.   The chips and salsa are BOMB! First of all you get selection. Someone at the table not a big fan of hot salsa? They can mix their own! You get a side of three different salsas and your own mixing bowl. It's great for families that are huge and want different styles, chunky, smooth, spicy, or mild. As far as the chips, they are always fresh, little salt, and hot. They will refill them all (chips and salsa) for free which is nice since most restaurants are starting to charge.   The atmosphere is very \"Phoenix\" and makes me feel great when I walk in and see AZ Cardinals signs and other Arizona paraphernalia. Everything about Pedro's is great and I recommend it to anyone visiting the Glendale area or if you live there and haven't been there you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I love the way the waitress use a team system, it makes sure that your order is taken very fast and you get refills on your drinks as well. The chips are very good and they have 3 types of salsas, which are great. I like to mix the hot chunky salsa with the mild. The mild salsa has black olives in it which makes for a very interesting combination. My favorite thing to eat here is the beef tacos. The best flavor of any tacos I have had. The rice is really good too. Other greats are the Mini stuffed quesadilla and cheese crisp. The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars is that the prices are pretty expensive for the casual and much in need of updated dining room."}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food, this is one place to start.  You get a lot of food and it isn't over-the-top spicy.  Good for out of town guests.  Haven't had anything thee that I didn't like, so order what you like."}
{"text":"The place is small and dark , I like to see what I'm eating . The green tamale were OK but the sauce was blah. The beans were cold , but salsa was ok not great but ok.We never got the same server  twice. One of the server look like she hated her job she never smile. It would have been nice to felt welcome not like a bother."}
{"text":"Went to Pedro's last night had a quesadilla. But their chips and salsa is the best I think I've had"}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews but I checked yelp reviews first before going & trying out Pedro's for the first time.  The reviews were very good so we tried it.  My husband went for take out, he said it was packed with people.  Thank you to those came here & left reviews because we may not have tried it if it weren't for all of your very good reviews.  And as for what we think -  oh yeah very good first my son said they have open faced casa dejas?  Where is this place ? Most places don't have open faced casa dejas.  And then my husband took his first bite of his fry bread with red chili, lettuce &  tomato he said oh yeah.  It's good this place deserves a second second visit, and the meat is not dry.  And from me we have been looking so long for this tasting food.  So full of flavor, satisfying on the first bite.  Its so hard to find this good tasting food now adays.  Thank you so much Pedro's and reviewers, you and the good food are the reason why I am leaving this review.  Its very good."}
{"text":"Great food and love the service - all the Ladies are so helpful and friendly. Ambiance is down home and cozy. Anything with the shredded beef is delicious. Chips, when hot (usually are) are amazing with the salsa, hot sauce and pico de gallo - if you ask for it. It's our family's go-to place on a Friday night.  Can't give it 5 stars though. Last year's price increase makes it difficult for a family of 4 to leave without spending $65-$80 for dinner. Ouch."}
{"text":"Same tired décor for at least two and a half decades and the restrooms are to be avoided. Prices are up and overall quality of the food is mediocre. Salsa is overly sweet, I spice it up with the hotter version. The best things I can say are easy access with ample parking and quick friendly table service. The mini San Marcos burro is an OK lunch choice as is the chile relleno plate. I no longer bring out of town visitors here."}
{"text":"Pedro's is great for Mexican style comfort food. It's a real neighborhood gem. I've loved Pedro's since the first time I tried it in 1996.  I always go in and order the green chunky beef enchiladas with rice and beans. The green chile is not hot at all and it is almost broth-like. The rice is cooked and seasoned perfectly. The service is always a little touch and go. Sometimes you find a waitress in a good mood who is attentive and then you find one that's strictly business with barely any warmth. So don't go there for hugs and kisses, just good food! Pedro's is a fixture in Glendale, and I hope it's there for many more years!"}
{"text":"My first visit is very positive.  The pinto beans were truly modern, full flavor pinto bean, I will be back, again and again.    Crunchy was crunchy satisfying all the senses.  I am not a hot lover, but I do like spicy and flavor.  The Spanish rice was delicious.  I found nothing to my displeasure."}
{"text":"Pedro's is very far from my house (45 mintues) but it is worth every single second of that drive.  The place is not nice... i'd more so call it a \"whole in the wall\". However, the staff is nice and the food is delicious so it makes up for it.  It can be pretty busy, so sometimes there is a small wait. Some of the seats are bad, so it's nice when you can go when they have down time & while they let you seat yourself.  Food is great- chips and salsa with the chunky salsa is awesome. I love their cheese crisp and the Pedro's special (cheese enchilada & beef taco).   Prices over the years seem like they're going up... so check out the deal on the chalkboard as you're walking in, that will save you a few dollars."}
{"text":"nasty, overpriced, bland food. dont understand how people make lines and wait for this place. they obviously don't know any better. i can think of at least 20 places around it that are 100% better. they only reason it is so popular is because it is owned by white people. dont waste your time people...stop being so ignorant and racist and try other restaurants who aren't owned and operated by caucasians. help the economy, close your narrow mind, step outside the box and give other restaurants a chance, i guarantee you that you will agree with this review....zero stars"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've consumed in my whole entire life!! I came to visit from Arizona from  California especially since we are closer to the boarder and we have many options to choose from for Mexican food but there is no place like Pedro's!!!  It's a hole in the wall and the area is bit sketchy but those enchiladas are well worth the trip. I stayed in Arizona for 2 nights and came here twice!!   The enchiladas and that sauce is AAAAMMMAZZIIIGGGG!!!   Beans and rice are tasty!!! And they are very generous with their portions.      This place does not get enough recognition of what is deserved."}
{"text":"The food was good as well as the service. By making my own Hot sauce was able to get the hotness I like!!! Chips were fresh and great. The taco on the bussiness mans plate was top notch! Only thing that wasnt  top notch was the decor and the seating space."}
{"text":"This needs 10 starts. Family run and operated. Coming since I was 5. Best chicken taco I've ever had in my life. Everything is amazing I always leave with chips and hot sauce. Worth it. I love this place. Feels like home."}
{"text":"The food is good but the prices have gone up quite a bit. The first time I came here was twenty years ago and it hasn't changed one bit. They really could do with a face lift, especially the booths, they are all so cramped together that the table is right in your stomach. Service is good."}
{"text":"Our friends have been on us to try Pedro's for a few months now. We decided to finally give it a try and holy hot dog we've been missing out on some authentic Mexican food. It was quite delicious. The staff was very friendly. We were not disappointed in the least and will definitely be back soon!! We HIGHLY recommend Pedro's."}
{"text":"This place is my fave Mexican restaurant in phoenix.   Great, authentic food made fresh and a cool place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Service flat out sucked! Their waitresses were all sitting around or making themselves drinks while we waited to put our orders in for over 10 minutes(there were only 3 other groups). When we finally got our food it was undercooked and cold."}
{"text":"Stopped in this weekend to have a meal with a dear friend after a gap of MANY years and was happy to see the joint was jumping'!!!  We were seated immediately and brought drinks shortly thereafter.  I asked about the beans and was brought a small plate to try, which was a pleasant surprise   We both ordered a cream cheese-chicken chimichanga thing that was really yummy.  They were a nice  compact size and we were able to finish them off easily.  The service was great...efficient and unobtrusive.  Paying the bill involves visiting the cashier on the way out.  A couple of 10 cent York Peppermint Patties rounded,the meal out nicely.  We left full and happy.   The total cost was $30, which included a generous tip!  I don't get over to downtown Glendale very often but am happy to recommend Pedro's for a good Mexican meal to those who do."}
{"text":"Mediocre Food even worse service. I had to get a steak picado because that was the only way the would serve the steak I had to send it back because it was so tough to bite into and got a shredded beef chimichanga which had no flavor. Also THEY DO NOT SERVE HORCHATA! Tf? The waitresses ignore you and avoid you until tip time. Did not have a good experience."}
{"text":"Pretty average Mexican food. Although their green corn tamales are the best in town! It's the reason I come here."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at my own self for never having left a review before. I never go anywhere else.  Everything about Pedro's is perfect, everything. The service, the bussers or waitress assistants, cashier, all of it. As for the food, I always get the same thing. Chicken Taco,  Cheese Enchilada and beans on the side. Well, \"almost\" always. The Red Beef Burro, deep fried, Enchilada style is so good. and the tamales are always great.  I was just reading the reviews. Almost all are quite favorable. I was astonished to see a couple of bummer reviews. Words fail me. Ah Well, if those TWO persons don't want to come to Pedro's anymore, it just means more for the rest of us! Thanks :)"}
{"text":"They are very generous with the delicious chips and salsa to start off your meal.  We love their shredded beef tacos and usually get a combo plate that includes one taco....we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Pedros is a classic hole in the wall neighborhood Mexican restaurant. It's one of my wife's favorite comfort food spots shes visited for over the past decade that I am taken along with at least once or twice a month. Their chips and salsa (hot salsa) are probably the best served at a restaurant (except out of my own kitchen or the pico at El Comedor Guadalajara) and that is not a misstatement. I'm a big salsa fan and grow my own chiles and know the difference between good salsa and bunk salsa. I've read several reviews out there where people rave about the salsas served at Macayos, Manuels, etc. That stuff is whack. Now that I got that off my chest...back to the review. While Pedros isn't the cheapest Mexican fare its far from pricey. The staff is always helpful and the food comes out right away and is piping hot. The combo meals are definitely big enough to share. My favorite is the San Marcos Burro with green cubed chile. Its basically a deep fried burro topped with a concoction of sour cream, cream cheese, and jalapenos that is the perfect contrast to the flavors of the burro and green chile. Here are few other honorable mentions:  Bean chimi, enchilada style with red sauce  San Marcos enchiladas  Beef taco  Mary lou  Taquitos  Sweet green tamale w/ sauce on the side (best sweet green tamale I've ever had!) While everything on the menu is pretty tasty these are on my wife and my usual hit list. The one recommendation I will make is when the waitress comes to your table and asks if you want regular or hot and chunky salsa that you respond - Hot and chunky please!"}
{"text":"Pedro's was recommended to us by a friend.  I have been a few times and I am just wowed.  You walk in and you think you have entered the 70's, but it works at this place. It adds to the charm.  The staff are very friendly and kind.  The food is absolutely amazing.  I have had the chicken tacos, an enchilada, and a releno.  They have all been good-this is not your typical phoenix mexican food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food places... Really good food, really quick service!!"}
{"text":"Small place that hasn't redecorated in years (see the Phoenix Cardinals banners), but the food was still ok, but not everything outstanding. This would be your standard mom and pop place and it had a good crowd about 6pm on Saturday night, but only a short 5 minute wait.  They have no white meat chicken - really?  The beef that was in my taco tasted a bit off, not seasoned or anything. The $7.95 guacamole cheese crisp was the highlight off the appetizer menu The sweet green corn tamale was the highlight of combo 1 The red enchilada sauce was very tasty Free chips and two kids of salsa - both had little heat Old School - pay at register Some waitresses chewing gum which is a turn off for me Shady area, so get in and get home after dark  Might return for a happy Hour if in area, otherwise just another Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food restaurant, their hot sauce is so good I buy extra when I'm in town (haven't lived in Arizona since 1996). I make it a stop every time I'm in town to visit. I love their combo plate (taco, enchilada) and could eat their chips and salsa all day. Their staff are always friendly and their prices are very competitive."}
{"text":"Not sure how or why they get these good reviews.  Salsa tasted watered down. Chopping up cilantro and adding it to canned stewed tomatoes is not salsa.  The chips were good...light crispy and not oily.  Not to rant on and on but the food lacked flavor. Their kitchen is afraid to use salt and seasoning.   ***Biggest concern --- they keep the silverware, cups, etc right directly outside the bathroom door, which is also adjacent the kitchen door. Look it up, airborne bathroom contaminants and they are landing on what you are eating with. So gross.   Over rated over priced....go to a --bertos' down the road for a better meal. Taco seasoning packets rate higher on the flavor scale...but hey I guess some people like bland and bacteria."}
{"text":"So many reviewers gave this 4stars but i'm not sure at all why.  When in Arizona and you live in Washington, getting good Mexican food is a treat.  After a Mariners spring training game we decided to treat ourselves.  Used mobile Yelp on my phone and found this was close so we decided to try it.  The service was very good and the waitress pleasant and helpful especially when we asked what she recommended.  One of my friends had a grandma who made authentic tamales so he ordered those as did my husband.  I opted for a green corn tamale because i love green sauce.  On all the tamales there was more masa than filling which made them heavy and dry.  I guess it was green sauce on mine but it sure looked yellow to me.  Friend said it wasn't like grandma made.  All in all it was just a so so meal which was sad since the place got so many wonderful reviews."}
{"text":"I live in CA now, but every time I'm back in AZ I eat at Pedro's. And I am usually there with my family within the hour of touching down from the plane or drive. We have all been going there for about 20 years.   It is the absolute BEST Mexican Food. While other places in CA here are good too, I haven't been able to find one comparable to Pedro's. There's just a different, Sonoran taste to theirs that I can't find out here.   Gotta get the Pedro's Special and  a Chimichanga! And the staff is wonderful and friendly.  GO TO PEDRO'S!   (the only gripe I have is that they are closed on Sunday)"}
{"text":"Lady J. remarked of the, \"crappy atmosphere and decor.\"  I disagree passionately.  It's kind of dark.  Old carpet.  Wood panel walls.  Mexican rugs hung from the ceiling.  Random artwork.  Very small-town, very Arizona.  I loved it.  The service?  Great!  Our waitress and no less than four other employees were very attentive.  Refills were prompt and there were smiles abound.  The food?  Good, not great.  The salsa tasted a little like pizza sauce and my green chile was very runny - a personal pet peeve.  On the other hand, the rice, beans, and tortilla were exceptional.  Our meal was cheap.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Kind of cramped.  Not a good place to take young kids.  My beer mug was dirty, and I never notice things like that.  Service was slow and not the friendliest.      No music was playing.  I felt that people were too quiet because they felt everyone was listening to them, and there was that one loud jackass that talks too much in the restaurant annoying everyone.    Play some Mexican music Pedro's.  Food was average Mexican food- I tried tacos, enchiladas, beans, rice.    Prices were very reasonable.  Maybe it was a bad day for them.  I'd be willing to give it another try if hungry for Mexican food and in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. Amazing salsa. Great service. Go eat and enjoy relax.  The chicken here is really special too. Anything chicken tasty."}
{"text":"Had a great meal complete with green chili cheese crisp and chimichaungas.  Very good and so fresh.  This is a local favorite, I know my family has eaten here since the early 70s   traditional Mexican decor, friendly service and good food  and fast.   They have beer, wine and margarita coolers, but no tequila since they don't have a liquor license.  Give it a try you will like it"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the WORLD!!!!! I grew up in glendale and know my mexican food no mexican food restaurant even comes close."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pedro's since I was very young. It was great back then and it's still great now. The chips & salsa is in point, the service is great, and the food is amazing. You won't be disappointed. Owner Butch is a very nice guy too. He stops in all the time.  *Phoenix Foodies Approved"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They serve delicious salsa with fresh tortilla chips when you're seated. I love the mini menu.  The chimichanga is DELICIOUS and it comes with guacamole and sour cream. The beans are also really good. The service is also excellent.  The servers are very kind and patient."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. They have good food, and really good salsa. I love their chimichanges (for years I've evaluated mexican food restaurants by their chimis). The place is clean and well maintaineed, and the staff very courteous. This place is very popular, and can be busy, but I've always been able to get a table, and they are fast with the food."}
{"text":"Party of three, arrived at 4:30 pm. You seat yourself. Impressed with how busy it was so early in the evening. Service was great. I ordered the shrimp tacos. I liked the refried beans, you could taste the ham bone flavor. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place starts, middles, and ends with the San Marcos chicken burro. If you go to Pedro's, order it and don't agree, I will take a 50-cent piece out of my personal fortune and mail it to you*  It's got jalapeno cream cheese for Pete's sake..the burro not the 50-cent piece.  JFK didn't care for spicy dishes unless it was Rita Moreno!!!!  I'm drunk right now...drunk on how awesome the San Marcos burro is.     *provided you reside within the continental U S of A. and are not currently on medication of any kind."}
{"text":"Pedros has an awesome green corn tamales,  there salsa has a unique flavor and includes black olive pieces.  Very reasonable prices and modest decor. Closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"Standard tex mex fare -- pools of refried beans, lots of mild cheeses melted over everything, big fat burros with sauces ladled on top. Nothing is particularly exciting or innovative, but it's solid comfort food delivered quickly and expertly. Lighting is dark and pleasant, giving the restaurant a comforting cave feeling.  The speed and and precision of the house and kitchen can't be overstated. Food just seems to materialize.   Also, I was once here with a toddler who was in a developmental phase where he couldn't stop exploring and making a mess, despite our best efforts. I was mortified and left a big tip, but years later I still feel terrible about the state the table was left in. I'm haunted by it. Enjoy your five stars, Pedro's, and I'm sorry."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. I love the complimentary chips and the spicy salsa, very good. I ordered the shrimp salad and it was tasty! The avocado made it perfect. I love how they give you they you a little pitcher if you order iced tea! Service was awesome as well:) Will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to Love this place been going there for over 20 years. The customer service has gone down as well as the food quality. I would go twice a week for the chips and hot sauce and mild salsa. Sadly they seem to have changed the Hot Sauce recipe and it is not tasty at all. I'm not sure if they changed cooks or what but the food just doesn't taste the same. Please Pedro's get it together you were my all time favorite place."}
{"text":"My spouse and I have been coming here 17 years.  It's a warm and cozy atmosphere. We've tried just about everything on the menu except the burger.  We come for the Mexican food!  Our favorites are the San Marcos chicken or beef enchiladas as well as the red chili beef.  The chips are always crispy and fresh.  The salsa is our favorite in the valley.  The fry bread is deliciously light!  How do they do that?  LOL.  Oh and the chili relleno is the bomb. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"So, my family and I decided to try this place for the first time....we seated ourselves as the sign stated. Chips, salsa and water were served. Chips were very good the mild salsa reminded me of pace picante sauce. The hot was watery but had a good flavor to it. I decided to order off the lunch special menu...I ordered the San Marcos Chicken burro with rice and beans ($8.25).  Time to taste my lunch: Rice was bland, beans OK and the burro was good for the first bite, second bite OK and then I just couldn't handle another taste of the cream cheese sauce. It over powered the taste of the chicken!  Service was ok, we sat close to the bathrooms and where the wait staff served drinks....kinda wished we didn't sit there since we could hear all the gossip going on! We experienced a couple in front of us trying to get one of the waitress attention for at least 5 minutes and they were just busy talking. Finally the lady got up and asked for more water.   Overall....I've had better! The booths are small and cramped and the food is nothing special! I did love the Chips."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Mexican food restaurant. I get the exact some meal every time I go. I get the shredded beef burrito and it is the best one I have ever had. No one has ever come close to having better tasting salsa than Pedro's as well. It's sweet instead of spicy. My family and I have recommended this place to so many people and it has always been a success."}
{"text":"Our family of six was so impressed by the service. The servers work as one bug team instead of having specific stations. This led to very adequate refills and attention. Chips and salsa were so good. Food is large in quantity and delicious. Great find when we visited Glendale."}
{"text":"I love this place. Again I have been visiting them since the 90's. Great food, good, prices, and good salsa. my family loves this place too. They do Groupons once in a while and i always buy 2, one for me & one for my sister,"}
{"text":"Best seasoned shredded beef in the city!  You also must try their San Marcos sauce, you will get hooked!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here last night. We used a Groupon for $20 worth of food for $10. The food was good and even though they were crazy busy they were still very friendly and attentive. You have to put your name on the list when you walk in, literally- you have to write your name on their list that's kept on a clip board by the register. The only snag was that we were waiting outside and when they called our name inside first someone else took our table. We went in to check to see how much longer it was going to be and saw our name had been crossed off. When we brought this to the attention of the hostess she apologized and made it right by seating us immediately. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Pedro's for many years but now I am having to say goodbye because they have raised their prices too much for me. Their combination dinners were $12.55, now the price is $14.30, I liked the chimichanga's, was $10.75, now $12.25. This is Glendale, not Scottsdale. I enjoyed your food while it lasted."}
{"text":"Yummy food no drinks like margaritas so i go elsewhere. Been going here since a little kid always has a wait and has some of the same staff from the 70's. Lots of good times here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service is so fast I think it takes less time to get my food there than at a mcdonalds. Great food decent staff."}
{"text":"As far as Mexican food goes, these guys are the best. They have been around forever and just keep doing the same thing every time, which is make great food.  Dont let the location fool you, this is the class of Arizonan Mexican food. Worth a trip regardless of where you are travelling from."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was able to eat. I love this place. So authentic. So original. Just amazing."}
{"text":"small down home, real food place! its soooooo good! just go try it!"}
{"text":"Our family has has been coming to Pedro's for three generations. When our kids come into town they always make sure to visit Pedro's at least once. The salsa and chips are great. The shredded beef taco is always a favorite as is the open faced cheese crisp. The service is very fast. I am making myself so hungry for Pedro's that I guess we will go there tonight."}
{"text":"Looked super busy so i was sure it would be good food. I always order a chile relleno because that is something that defines a really good mexican restaurant in my opinion. It was average, but the sauce was salty. Beans and rice, the same, average. I wont go back again, there are tooooo many good Mexican restaurants around town."}
{"text":"I prefer the shredded beef way over the chicken, let me say. Theyre tacos, taco salads, and beans are just so good. The taco salad is ginormous, definitely a share item. Its loaded with beans, meat, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce. I absolutely love it. Their salsa is quite good, especially with their fresh chips. The servers here all assist with every table, so you will never wait long for anything. There is always someone coming by checking on you and giving you what you need, which is not common. It's a little dark and very dated in here, but the food is good and decently priced for the large portions."}
{"text":"Delicious.  I called am they took my order before opening hours. Nachos!  Here I come.  Ok, Disappointing they will be closed on Thanksgiving Day, but hey I can show up One day before and stock up.  Lots,of hot sauce please need fuel for black Friday!"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos and cheese enchiladas are my favorite. Their lunch menu is great! It's super fast and you can pick one or two items with rice or beans. You get your chips and salsa immediately and you can chose just the mild (which is chunky) or the hot (which has no chunks) or you can mix the two together. I have come here 15+ times and they never let me down! You can buy their chips and salsa or flour tortillas. I also love to buy their enchilada sauce! One of my favorite Mexican joints in the valley!"}
{"text":"My aunt gets food from Pedro's almost every week and when I can drag myself to that side of town I always eat here.  We were here last week for dinner and had a delightful cheese crisp (truly the best invention EVER!) as an appetizer.  I usually order their combo with chicken tacos but decided to order a chicken burro this time.  Their burro plate comes with a burro (no sauce) and rice and beans.  The burro was decent (beware, their chicken is cooked in a sauce so if you are not a fan of sauces it may catch you off guard.  I like it though!)  I like the beans but their rice lacks something...  The rest of their food is really good.  My mom always gets the shredded beef burro enchilada style with green sauce and it's delicious.  Lots of shredded beef!  Bottom line: This place has been here forever and is always packed.  That should speak volumes as there are a milion restaurants in this city.  If you're in Glendale, go to Pedro's!"}
{"text":"Finally found a great Mexican food restaurant in the west valley! Being a California transplant I didn't realize finding good Mexican food would be so impossible. But this place nailed it! Amazing fresh thin crispy chips. Two salsas to dip. Ordered the three shredded beef taco plate and my husband ordered the shredded beef chimichanga. Rice was fluffy and fresh. Beans were great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Whopping portions and exemplary service combine with excellent-tasting Mexican food to make Pedro's a Mexican restaurant worth your drive and money.  Regular customers fill the seats which reflects the excellent service.  Chips and homemade salsa are delivered almost instantly after being seated, and the entrees are delivered quickly.  I had the 3 mini beef taco, tostada, and tacquito combo (picture is attached) and it was enormous and very tasty.  I was hungry and could only eat half, so it could definitely be enough for two people to split.  Part of what brought me here was the buy-one, get-one coupon in the Entertainment Book.  So, even though my combo was normally $12, it averaged out to $6 after the coupon.    On the downside, the place is pretty tacky and the building is outdated.  But, I'm willing to overlook it once I realized the quality that they serve.  In short, Pedro's is arguably one of the better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Don't let the line wrapped around the building during the lunch hour scare you away.  If you see that anywhere, you make time to wait in line.  It's a small local dive, but the food is as good as I've had nationally.    Even something as simple as the chips and salsa are out of this world.  Get a burro...any of them...and leave happy.  Awesome, awesome joint."}
{"text":"Delicious food for the value. The booths are cramped though and the ambiance is 40 years due for an upgrade. The inside need's some TLC, feels and smells a little like walking into an old RV camper, with retro carpets that were cool in the 80's or 70's, think Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite. The staff is usually nice and the food always comes out fast. Their tacos are juicy and are crisp, with lots of cheese. I love the food, just hope they upgrade the inside, feels a little musky and run down. They recently installed a brand new sign, which looks great on the outside. Maybe this is a 'sign' of something special to come for the inside as well. If they update the interior to a cleaner, less dingy atmosphere, then they will definitely get a another star."}
{"text":"My favorite thing was the salsa, it had chopped black olives in it. It had a different taste than I'm used to....a little sweet. Service was quick and good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My dad has been bringing me to Pedro's since I was a little girl.  I always get the same thing, chicken chimichanga - it's ooohh so good.  It's not those big chunks of precooked shamrock chicken that you get at a lot of Mexican food places, it's real chicken and it's been cooked with love, you can tell.  Chips and salsa are both hot and fresh, always.  The place is small and sometimes you have to wait for a table but it's always worth the wait.  The ladies bathroom is gross, just hold it until you get somewhere safe."}
{"text":"Tried the Indian fried bread.   It was cool they offer it but it was just OK. I had it topped with green chili and cheese.   The green chili was good. Nice kick without being too hot.   The fried bread was just OK. It seemed a little old, perhaps frozen and reheated.   The swap meet has better.   The chips and salsa were good. I prefer the hot sauce over the salsa.   They have nothing over Ponchos in S Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went there with out-of-town guests cause they were staying in the west valley, and it had been recommended to me.   I had the chicken burro plate with rice and beans, he had the same version except with beef, and I don't remember what she had.   I give it two stars for the salsa, but that's about it.   If that was chicken in my burro, I don't know what kind of chicken it was.   It surely didn't taste like chicken.   And the consistency was basically unappetizing.  It came with rice and beans.   The rice was tasteless till I poured the salsa over it.  In fact, that is what I did with the burro to give it some flavor.  The refried beans is typical refried beans out of a can.   My relatives said it was good.   I mean, they were my guests.   What are they going to say.   Plus, they are from a city that doesn't do Mexican food well.   Would I go back?   A resounding no!"}
{"text":"Wowza, I've been to Pedro's several times and each time was great but today it better than great!  I enjoyed a green chili burrito smothered in green chili.  It was delicious.  There salsa wasn't spicy enough so I mixed some of the hot with it and it was delicious!  The chips were perfect!  I know that might sound funny but very few restaurants have chips that taste this good!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant. We have eaten here at least 30 times. There has been nothing on their menu that we have not enjoyed. Even the chips and salsa are worth the trip. Pedro's is in the Entertainment book and often have Groupon offerings. From the outside, it appears to be the proverbial hole-in-the-wall, but it is like coming home."}
{"text":"Always fast friendly service. They have the best shredded beef around. Great hot sauce and salsa. We have been coming here for years and they never disappoint"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place for Mexican food in The Valley !!!  I have now moved back to Missouri and I miss my Pedro's !!!   Their shredded beef melts in your mouth!! Love the salsa & rice, too!  Cheese crisp is wonderful !  Serve is fast too.  You would never guess from the outside that this little place is the gem that it is!  I could give it 10!stars !"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch just after 11 today.  The parking was already almost full even though there were plenty of empty tables inside.  The sign, that I didn't see for a couple of minutes, said to seat myself so I picked a table.  Just by myself I would have like a two top but all of the seating arrangements seemed to be 4-6.  The restaurant never filled up so I didn't feel bad for taking a space away.    I got a two item lunch special ($7.25) of a beef taco and a cheese enchilada with beans (I could have had rice rather than beans).  I also got a root beer ($2.05).  Most of their drinks have an extra charge for refills but this was not a small glass and was plenty.  Right after I seated myself a bowl of warm chips, a small mixing bowl, a carafe of mild salsa and a bottle of hot sauce were on the table.  It was neat being able to adjust the heat of my salsa.  The shredded beef was very tasty and the shell was thin and crisp without being hard to bit through.  I would suggest eating the tacos quickly before the shell gets soggy. The enchilada and the beans were ok.  The sauce was a bit different than some other places.  The service was quick and attentive.  You can tell they are used to getting the lunch crowd in and out in a reasonable amount of time.  They have a couple of other weekday lunch specials as well as some smaller appetite options of  their regular menu items that can be ordered anytime."}
{"text":"This was very solid, authentic Mexican food.  Great discovery, and we look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Love it here!!! Must try their hot & chunky salsa! But you have to ask for it ;) taco's rock!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Pedro's using our Groupon we had purchased. I can say that this place has been around for 50 years per our cashier and it is well established. The service was prompt and the ice tea, chips and salsa were very good. The salsa wasn't overpowering and the chips were crispy and light. Our meals arrived shortly after we had finished eating the chips and salsa. My husband ordered the #1 and I ordered the #3. The shredded beef tacos, cheese enchiladas and tamale were delightful. Every bite was savory and tender.  I would recommend this restaurant for Mexican food. The staff is friendly and efficient, attentive and helpful. We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and value.  Comfy inside.  Try the Chicken Picado."}
{"text":"I love this place  The best green corn tamales in the world    Chicken tacos are to die for and the salsa is fantastic!  You choose how hot by adding a little hot to the mild."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Pedro's.  It is in downtown Glendale which is not the most exciting place in the world, so finding Pedro's was extra special.    I love salsa.  Pedro's lets me pretend like I am actually making my own salsa (this is a good thing) by bringing three different salsas with varying flavors and spiciness.  They will give you countless amounts, which is a plus.  The added bonus is, of course, that everyone at the table can be happy with whether the salsa is mild, medium or hot by having their own bowl to mix it all in.  I have only had the San Marcos Enchilada dinner on my three visits and enjoyed it thoroughly each and every time.  It has this yummy jalapeno sauce that I love.  My companions usually get something basic- a burrito, enchiladas or a salad and are happy with it.  I haven't heard any real complaints.  It is small and busy, but a great find in downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I originally tried it from a Groupon purchase.   Have been back several times since.   The shredded beef and red chili beef are the best I have ever had at  any mexican restaurant.   Not an ounce of fat in either one.  The salsas are all top notch.  They offer a chunkier type salsa that you must ask for.  Please do this, it is a great salsa.  Also, try the San Marcos sauce a cream cheese type mixture that is simply wonderful.    I did not care too much for the enchiladas.   The beans and rice are fine.  The only reason I gave four stars instead of five are the ambiance and lack of margaritas.   The place is very old and dated.  Popcorn ceilings and dark paneling.  They do offer beer and wine.  They do have  a pseudo margarita that is made with wine rather than tequila, however I have not tried this yet.  Service is average.  Not good not bad.  Try Pedro's you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I would not say it was authentic Mexican, it seemed to cater to American tastes (like olives in the dishes). I felt like I was visiting my family in Michigan and having Mexican there. I still enjoyed it, but its just a different flavor. The service was great, very friendly.  Now the food- I had the shrimp tacos. They were tasty, but I wish the fillings stayed in the tortila better. The shrimp had a nice flavor. My baby ate all the beans and rice, so she was happy. My husband had shredded beef tacos. He thought they were good, but the beans and rice were average. The chips and salsa were tasty, I just wish the \"hot salsa\" was hotter. The price was good- we even had a groupon which made it better. I would go again since it is close to hubbys work or if I had another groupon."}
{"text":"I grew up on the west side of town and Pedro's has been a favorite for over 20 years. The food is consistently good, always hot and they are fast regardless of how busy they are. The chips and salsa are crave worthy as well as the San Marcos sauce. I almost hate to review Pedro's because I don't want others to know, but considering its been around for about 60 years, if you don't know- I'm ok with that."}
{"text":"The lunch menu prices are very affordable. I had the mini chimi plate with rice and beans. It's a big serving. My middle son had the 2 item lunch combo and the youngest had the kids bean burrito meal. Everyone enjoyed their food. The three of us split a fried ice cream. We have been here many times and enjoy the food. We found the waitresses to be slow/distracted. That is why we docked one star."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid. The food is great! needs an update on the interior but heh...who cares since the food is sooo good. If you ever want to try some really good mexican food...this is the place!"}
{"text":"I will drive an hour from my home in Mesa for their green corn tamales in a heart beat :) love this place! This place is a Glendale Classic!"}
{"text":"Not all that. Not so happy cashier lady. Got two burritos and the tortillas didn't look cooked enough asked if they can toast it like they do their quesadillas server took it to the back and came to ask if I wanted deep fried because they don't do such a thing even though our friend had a shredded beef quesadilla right in front of him."}
{"text":"YUM!!!  This place is absolutely delicious!  I'm 32 years old and have been coming here since I was 8!  I have never been disappointed with the food in all the years I've been coming here.  My all time favorite is their red tamales.  I get it without the red sauce but with cheese on top.  I also love their mini shredded beef chimi's and I could eat bowl after bowl of their chips and salsa.  I could seriously live off of Pedro's. I was just there last week for dinner and already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The service was good, the tacos (beef) were great, the meat had great flavor,  the food came fast, pace was pretty full but we didn't wait to seat ourselves at 1pn on a Friday.  The chips and salsa were good too as were the enchiladas.  The rice and beans ok to average. Would come back if in the area, but for a long dRive like this,  mAybe not make a special trip. ..overall was a nice impression for a first visit.  A small old school house style Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is one of those establishments where people have been true to since childhood, me being one of them. Even will see the local celebs in there from time to time, I have personally sat next to jerry calangalo ( ex owner of az sports teams, probably not spelled correctly) and others on a few notes. They have the perfect shredded beef taco, and I also enjoy there red chile burro, so try the combo. The chips are good and come non stop, I love the spicy red sauce that comes with them, it's tasty to douse pretty much everything you get with this sauce. One not so great thing is that they charge you for every soda you drink, I drink ice tea because of this - ice tea = free refils. They have good service and whenever I come across a waitress that is lack luster, they seem to disappear by the time I make it back.  It may seem tacky in there to upscale scottsdale folk but I think it has authentic written all over it. The food will back it up, great place for you and your family, but seriously stop leaving 1 dollar tips for parties over 3, I swear the cheapskates of america frequently go to Pedro's because walking out I have seen everything from 50 cents to one dollar left as a tip. I would suggest for anyone to at least go give this place a try and come open minded. It's real good!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to this restaurant for years.  I wouldn't classify it as traditional Mexican food, but the food and service is always good and the chips and salsa are excellent!  I tend to order the San Marcos Burrito which is like a chimichanga cover in a spicy cream sauce. The tamales are also very good, they have the standard red and sweet green corn versions, plus a unique Vegi one that has broccoli, carrots, and other things you wouldn't normally expect in tamales.  The also offer a \"Mini Menu\" that will save on the wallet, but is still plenty of food and have lunch specials (which are actually served till closing on Mondays)"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place and had high hopes but left disappointed. The food is average at best. I am from Toledo, Oh and have had much better Mexican up there."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since I was a little kid and I fucking love this place. Ever since I was a kid I would always get the cheese crisp they have it small or large. Good portion for children cause they don't have a kids menu. But down the years I'm like time to make a change cause I've been getting cheese crisp for years. Soooo I got there combination order which comes with three beef tacos or chicken depends on you with a side of beans and rice. And omg they are the best tacos to have very juicy so be careful cause it burns like a motherfucker but so good and don't get me started on there chips and salsa so yummy, they got hot salsa & mild. Me personally I like to get a side of pico de gallo to mix in the hot salsa with it makes it so much better but the service is very fast and efficient and the waitresses are pretty great! But I've never once had a problem and I've been coming to this place since I was little so no bad vibes here I guarantee it."}
{"text":"This place in a golden little secret spot.  Their food is delicious. I had a cheese enchilada with a taco and tamale. The service was exceptional they wait was not long at all. The price is average it was wonderful here, I will be going back."}
{"text":"My son and I had lunch at this wonderful restaurant yesterday the food was amazing and out of this world. Our waitress was very courteous and polite. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a decent meal , wonderful food and a wonderful environment."}
{"text":"This little place is a gem. Great lunch specials. My yelp buddy has told me that this place has been here for years and not a thing has changed. When you walk in its quite dark with decor that has probably been here since opening many moons ago. But putting that aside the smells are awesome. Seating is mainly booth style with maybe 4 to 5 rectangular double tables down the middle of the dining area. Each booth is separated by old mexican style blankets which blocks light but gives a cozy feel. Waitresses are hustling and always attentive. I am pleased with the service they provide.   While you wait you are served chips and salsa. Chips are made to perfection. Two different style salsas are served with them one slightly chunky and one smooth with mild heat both are red. I had the lunch special beef taco and tostada. Both were delicious. The beef taco is made of tasty shredded beef nestled in a perfectly crunchy shell. Lettuce and shredded cheese top it. Simply made. Full of deliciousness. Tostada is made the same way. The shells of both had the perfect crunch. My choice of side was rice. The rice was good. I ate it all. Once you get the check you get up and pay at register. And you are out. I did not mention parking in beginning. There is parking on side of building and in the back of building where abandoned offices are but I do believe the resteraunt owns them for storage. If there is no parking there you will need to resort to street parking.  It is always a good sign of a good place to eat when you can't find parking. The times I have passed this place the lot has always been full. Seems to me this place is doing something right all of these years."}
{"text":"The food is great but 72$ for 3 people and no drinks except pop. No extras. No sides."}
{"text":"HOLY CHICKEN TACOS! I could seriously live on their chicken tacos every day for the rest of my life. I had never heard of this place before until my friend introduced me a few months ago. To start, their chips and salsa are awesome and the bring you enough salsa so you don't have to continue asking for more. All I've ever eaten here are the chicken tacos....they are that good. The chicken is juicy....flavorful...perfect. The refried beans are also amazing.   Pedro's has found a customer for life...I highly recommend this place if you are craving awesome Mexican food!"}
{"text":"It's pretty basic Mexican food. The shredded beef taco & cheese enchiladas were good. Preferred the hot over the mild salsa. Great, friendly & fast service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was 15 years old and it is amazing how much their food has not changed and in my opinion that is amazing.  Anyone who has lived in this are knows this is a solid place to eat!!  Their chips and salsa ROCK!!!  Their shredded beef tacos,  chimis, and anything else that has the shredded beef is amazing.  So tender and juicy with great seasonings.  Good service, nothing super fancy either, just a great place to eat if you want Mexican food.  Decent pricing and good lunch specials.  I have no preference as to what would be better than something on the menu.  I have tried just about everything and nothing is bad.  My favorites are the chimichangas, chicken or beef.  Either one is great.  If you are in the area and want a place to eat, try this!! I don't think you will be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Pedro's. It's small, It's old, and its good. Tacos Tacos Tacos... need I say more? Price is a little high if you ask me but for occasional visits it's ok."}
{"text":"I almost hate to post this because the place is so good.  I used to travel all over Az seeking out mexican food places... this is a classic 'Old School\" arizona mexican resturant. They all used to be this way. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been approximately 10 times. Each time was good. I love their green sauce. The restaurant itself isn't very appealing.  The location of the bathroom bothers me. It is definitely a safe bet when stuck in Glendale."}
{"text":"You can't argue with a restaurant that has been around for almost 60 years.  I believe if you asked my parents I've eaten here since before I can remember.    The food is always good and the service friendly and efficient.  I love just about everything on the menu and it's hard to pick a favorite, if I had to it would probably be the San Marcos Enchiladas.  Pedro's is just a great place to go when you want good Mexican food that is not messed up by fads and trends."}
{"text":"Wow, holy price increase AGAIN! A buck ten increase on a mini chimi, NO beans or rice? WOW-and a small dollop of sour cream and small squat of guac.  Charging 2.55 for ice tea, and then fill the glass/small pitcher with so much ice, you hardly receive any drink.  May have to reconsider our weekly visits now, so much more food at other places for the same amount of $."}
{"text":"I just want to say that I almost didn't stick around long enough to write a review! Being our first time there, we walked in and said hello to the woman in front who asked us flatly \"can i help you?\" Being my playful self l, I said \"we're here to eat!\" to which she replied with the disgust \"the sign says you can seat yourselves\"! A bit put off (especially since the sign was surrounded by a barrage of other decorations/signs), we decided to brush it off and find a seat. Bianca, our waitress, saved the day! Friendly and very helpful, she ensured we had everything we needed (which for both of us included the free chips/salsa and the 2 taco lunch special). Food was enough for us guys and plenty tasty. Full of food and content, we headed back to pay Miss Crabby, who thankfully was much more pleasant now that I put my credit card in her hand. If we'd had better treatment when we entered, I'd be more inclined to a 5-Star rating. As it is, a 4 it is!"}
{"text":"Love this place for over 30 years! The best! My children love coming here they say best Mexican food that reminds me of our Nana's cooking!"}
{"text":"Food is really good but the service SUCKS, I always order the nachos when I need a fix, there's enough to feed 2 maybe 3 in a single order. If you don't mind bad service for a descent meal, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Pedro's restaurant is pretty good Mexican food however it's not the best. Going around lunch hour can be busy. The only thing I would recommend from the menu is the green chile burrito, you can't go wrong with that. The salsa is not the greatest my family and I always add salt to it. The food does come out unusually fast and for some reason that has always freaked me out. Cooking Mexican food takes a lot of love and a lot of salt so when it comes out too quickly then it may not be so fresh. However I still enjoy the green burro from time to time"}
{"text":"My family's been going here for years. Ask for the spicier chunky salsa! If you eat meat, get the Mini Macho (I think it's been renamed). Otherwise, their Green Corn Tamale is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Been going here nearly three decades, my parents even longer. I'm a taco junkie and out of the countless taco shops I've been to, Pedro's still has the best shredded beef tacos I've ever had. The shells, cheese, and beef are always perfect! Great atmosphere and service, any waitress can help you. A little on the expensive side but worth it for the quality of the food. The chips and hot sauce are delicious, much better than Macayo's, Valle Luna, and others!"}
{"text":"If you want a great BIG plate of nachos piled high with meat/chicken, beans, real cheese, guacamole, sour cream and jalepenos...Pedros is the place.  The price may seem steep for the mini-nacho, but it easily feeds my family of 3.  It is a mountain of good food served in a fun environment.  Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Pedro's since it first opened and until recently I believed it to be the best Mexican food anywhere. The last three times I have ordered cheese enchiladas, which have always been my favorite, it is like they have been prefrozen and reheated. The cheese inside was not soft and melted as it once was. The cheese on top was melted leaving me to think they are doing something different with the inside. My daughter ordered the cheese enchilada last week and was of the same opinion. Until I can be assured that this dish will be as it was before, I will not be back and that saddens me for what once was my favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Pedro's - went there 27 years ago, and still continue to go there - the big thing for us is the consistency of the food.  It is good, and filling, and when I order my Chile Relleno dinner, it is exactly like it was 27 years ago.  I always order a beer - it is always ice cold - my husband gets iced-tea, and they always bring out a small pitcher for refills.  Good chips and salsa, and make sure you ask for the chunky one (pico de gallo), as it is a bit hotter (spicier) than the others.    You can always count on Pedro's - it is a comfortable place, we like the blankets hanging in between booths, and that they just focus on good food and good service."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican place that I have been going to since I was a kid. Maybe I'm biased lol the food is amazing. It's made quick and there's something for everyone. Food is reasonably priced as well. If you're in the area or not (it's worth a drive for us from surprise) then come check out this gem. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great enchilada sauce flavor, authentic beans, and the chips are the highlights from my visit. I'm not crazy about the area. But this place was a good choice."}
{"text":"Pedros-- will you marry me?  We have been seeing each other for over 20 years and I'm ready to make the commitment. You are the only Mexican restaurant for me. I love your salsa! Your nachos make me weak in the knees! I dream about your tacos!   Thank you for consistently wonderful meals. You complete me"}
{"text":"My family has been going here for DECADES! Always great food and service.  Best chips and salsa. Best cheese crisp. Best green chimi. And my favorite is the green chile relleno, haven't found any other chile relleno like it. Add on a chicken taco for perfect meal!"}
{"text":"Pedro's has been around for over 60 years, and tends to get rave reviews! I have tried it twice over the last year, and was underwhelmed each time. Hey, I may have been on an off day...twice. haha. Both times the food was mediocre at best. I am Mexican, so I may be basing their food off authentic mexican food, which this was not. Very true what other reviews have said, that the food was Americanized, but truly how can you make MEXICAN food American? The service was alright, but I almost felt rushed both times, how they drop the bill at the table. Also, after the drop off of food I felt like I had to chase down the server for more salsa.   This is great for people who want a fairly cheap quick lunch, but not somewhere I will be returning to. I would much rather go right up the road to La Perla for authentic Mexican cuisine!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, Great Price!  Can't go wrong here.  3 different Salsas all Bomb, Beans are Bomb, Red Chili is Bomb, Green Corn Tamale is Bomb.  Shredded Beef Tacos are orgasmic!"}
{"text":"Although the business man special looked rather appetizing. My business skills were not up to par this week enough for me to afford myself such a  luxury. I had the green chili pork, and just like Jim G I thought it was Bomb. I was fortunate though to have one of my business associates there with me , and as he had a great week. He allowed himself the business man special. He got the shredded beef, \"best in town\". The Taco he had was also said to be bomb. Great meal all around !"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for almost 30 years and it has remained a family favorite the entire time. The food and service is consistently very good. If you are looking for good, authentic Mexican food this is the place to go. Everything on the menu is simply delicious. I am not a fan of mild salsa, but I am addicted to the hot red & the hot chunky."}
{"text":"So bad. The tacos taste like the kind served at a grade school cafeteria. Terrible. The shell is straight from Old El Paso box. Chunky salsa, made from semi rotten stewed tomatoes.. beans were bean soup. Nothing impressive here. Please let me know if you have a place comparable to the food at La Perla, that's my bar of expectation. One star for good service from start to finish including cashier."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and the service and food was great. Depending on the time of day you go there is a waiting list if they are busy, but it is worth it. ."}
{"text":"#1 favorite mexican food! Me and my boyfriend eat there every week and we love it! The salsa is homemade and they have 4 different kinds. The chunky hot is delicious! You can even buy pints of the salsa and take it to go! The huevos rancheros are the best I have ever had!! If your looking for good mexican food this never disappoints."}
{"text":"Pedro's is one of the better Mexican food restaurants in Glendale.   Be warned though that this is a tiny establishment, with minimal parking.  Given that it was no surprise the place was packed.  My husband and I went on Friday evening about 6:30 and were expecting about a 20-30 minute wait.  We were pleasantly surprised when we got a table after only 20 minutes.   I was not impressed with the complimentary chips and salsa, the chips were too thin and the salsa was too runny.  We ordered a guacamole cheese crisp appetizer, and it was good, nothing amazing but what can you say about any cheese crisp.  For dinner I had the San Marcos Chicken Burro and my husband ordered the Chimi San Marcos style with green sauce.  Both were huge, filling and super good.  I've never had San Marcos sauce before but this was really tasty.  Both the beef in the chimi and the chicken in the burro were moist and tender.  None of the food was very salty which is a huge plus to me.  The only thing I wish they differently was to offer a good spicy hot sauce.   Last thing to take into account, because it's so busy our waitress was not the most attentive although she was friendly"}
{"text":"This place is tiny but the food makes up for its small stature.  I've only been here twice and both times I ordered off the lunch menu. Its pretty reasonable at $7.25 for the most expensive items on it.  Best part: they have a Groupon going right now, so if you can, take advantage of it.  They're always packed, so you know the food is good, just dont expect your server to come back once your food arrives. They drop the check with the food and you just go up to pay in the front when you're done.   I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall Mexican couldn't get any better. The nachos are fabuloso (the small is more than any one person can handle) and the green corn tamales are out of this world! Salsa is great, service is great (at least the times I have been there)- I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pedro's for decades.  Their beef tacos are the best.  Marinated shredded beef that is not fried.  It is so tasty.  Don't skip this place."}
{"text":"The food was horrible! Just be aware that all the meat is shredded, even the chicken. I returned my chimichanga because I asked for beef and it was soft and shredded, the waitress said it was not it was chunk beef. It taste like old pot roast. The beans were straight out of a can. The chimichanga was $13.95, sent it back and asked for a chile relleno since it doesn't have meat. Chile relleno was a soggy egg batter with a green sauce made with so much flour you can taste it and it was white instead of green, they call it sauce but it was a thick gravy . Then when we got our tab, they didn't even remove the $13.95 Chimichanga so we had to have them remove it at the check out register. Seriously the quality of this food is no better than Old El Paso frozen dinner. Walked out paying $62 bucks for 3 adult dinners and a child dinner. We didn't receive any refill on our drinks and I forgot to mention that the waitress didn't want to take back the chimichanga, i had to tell her I didn't want it and make her give me something else. ."}
{"text":"Took the family last night. It was amazing . The salsa and chips are the best. Shredded beef tacos. Green corn tamales, rice and beans and cold beer. Great service . Can't wait to go back. Check it out , you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Great service. They all watch each others backs which substantially increases your chances of having the best service possible. This is amazing AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Try the San Manuel burrito (I think thats what its called) SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Pedro's since I was a child, and I wish I could give it dozens of five star reviews. The quality of the food, service, and atmosphere has never disappointed. I'll be coming back every chance I get as long as I live in the Valley."}
{"text":"Pedro's is one of my favorite place to go every time I'm craving for Mexican food.  I love their hot chunky salsa and chips.  My favorite menu item is # 1.  The plate is hot and huge it came out with a Red (meat) Tamale or Green (no meat) your choice and cheese enchilada and a taco (chicken or beef) and rice and beans!  Food is so delicious here I always lick my plate clean every time I come here!"}
{"text":"There is no better place for Mexican food in this town! I only wish they were open Sundays!   I mix the Mild salsa and the the chunky salsa together, awesome! I always go through an entire bottle of the hot sauce as well. Muey bueno!"}
{"text":"Excellent business model - prompt, polite service from the moment you sit down.  Straightforward menu.  HOT chips are on the table quickly with chunky mild salsa & hot sauce.  Entrees at lunch time come out in a flash.  Check is on table so I can pay at the door and be on my way.  I loved their process here, and the food was fairly good too.  Old school Mexican food, atmosphere, etc."}
{"text":"Food is good and very clean place with large helpings, but this is American tourist food, with the usual beans, rice, lettuce.... NOT real Mexican food."}
