{"text":"Had breakfast there with 2 friends, 9:30 on a Monday morn.  Pros;  Wasn't busy, and the cook cooked, took orders and served, and we were attended to as quickly and well as a place with multiple servers.  There were a couple other tables as well.  (By the time we left, another server had arrived.)  Regular breakfast special was cheap and good.  Cons;  Had that weird smell (disinfectant and grungy carpet) when I first walked in that I guess I got used to.  Perfectly good place for a quick and easy breakfast."}
{"text":"These guys do take-out and it is great!  I walked in unsure if take-out was available, as there is waiter service and quite a few tables. But, yes, right up front you can order from the sweetest old man I have seen in a while. He took good care of me; a Montreal smoked meat on rye with mustard and pickles on the side came to about $7.50 and it was like being transported to another place and time!  The menu is like a diner, with the addition of steaks, because the upstairs of Senior's is an old-school steakhouse. The vibe is old-school too, but the clientele are anything but. This place is a value and now that I have witnessed it, I will be back!"}
