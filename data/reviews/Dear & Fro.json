{"text":"Decent place - competition against Snow Time. Service was slow that day - we waited about half an hour. Portions were smaller than expected but tasted okay. Nothing spectacular but nothing wrong."}
{"text":"Not enough toppings in the middle.  Once you are done eating the top, it's just vanilla ice shavings in the middle and bottom.  Way too pricey for just ice and the bit of toppings at the top."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the desserts for the first time, enjoyed it very much! The mango / strawberry waffle was my fave! Would def go again and try out their other desserts."}
{"text":"Got the Oreo cheesecake bingsu. There was no cheese in the \"cheesecake\", more accurately it was a mousse cake with an Oreo crumb base. Bingsu was mediocre, nothing outstanding. 3 stars. 

Seating arrangements was also not the best. Service was poor. Walked in and was greeted, but not seated. Self serve seating, we could pick anywhere we wanted to sit."}
{"text":"Came here with excitement to try this new bingsu place in Scarborough because of the hype. Honestly, not worth the hype at all. Ambience of the place is cute and cozy. Love their marble finish table top and the decorations. Staff is friendly and welcoming. You have to place your order with the cashier and then find your own seat. 

Ordered the Injeolmi bingsu because I loved it at CUPS. I was very disappointed with the flavouring of this one compared to cups because of the lack of condensed milk and flavour in general. However, I do like the fact that you can really taste the milk in the bingsu. I felt like they should of layered their toppings to distribute the flavour evenly through every bite. The bowl is an awkward size as it is quite big for a single person but too small to share ($8.55 one size only). 

Didn't have to wait to get seated but had to wait over 20 minutes to get our bingsu. The place became busier closer to 9:30pm. Overall, it was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Hey btw mops and dirty mop water don't go next to where customers sit. It also smells like a gym. Cool aesthetic but the smell is unbareable."}
{"text":"The location and the stores are good, is just like snow time it have a little things in the menu and the location is right beside coco, so I will chose coco than this ice cream. However I will change my mind when the summer is coming, so far is winter and I feel really disappointing about the ice cream so bad review for now"}
{"text":"Rating - 3.0/5.0

Went to check out the soft opening of Dear Fro which serves up korean style shaved ice and various other desserts/snacks.

The decor and space is well designed with an elegant upscale feel. The amount of detail they put into the walls, table tops to the lighting and floor tiles is quite remarkable for a simple dessert joint.

We ordered the classic injeomi bingsu to compare it against Snow Time.

In terms of the shaved ice, there are a couple key things that separate the two apart.

Texture: The shape of the shaved ice is almost like coconut flakes so it is definitely not as fine and fluffy. This comes down to personal preference but I prefer the fine and fluffy texture more. On the plus side, it doesn't melt as quickly as the finer shaved ice that you see at Snow Time.

Flavour: Here they pride themselves of using pure milk as their base versus a water base for their shaved ice. It is very milky and creamy but it lacks the layering of soy powder in between the shaved ice. As such, it comes off as a bit bland.

All in all, I would come back again to try their other items. However I still prefer the shaved ice at Snow Time and The Cups over Dear Fro.

They have a 10% off special right now as a soft opening promotion. Also for those who are interested, they are giving away 50 free bingsu desserts on October 21st and 22nd to the first customers to line up during their grand opening.

They are located right across from Snow Time so it will be interesting to see how that plays out."}
{"text":"Depending on the times you go there could be a wait. 
Wait time after ordering takes a while as well but you are given a buzzer and can go back to you seat. 
Taste wise it's more on the milky side but very refreshing, some item that I wanted to try was not available yet."}
{"text":"Portion is way smaller than any other Korean shaved ice cafe yet with the same yet a little more expensive also. Not really worth the try"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Super Instagram worthy :D This place is known for its shaved ice desserts but my friends and I were really full and wanted something small and lighter. We went for this Honey-almond brick toast with 2 icecream scoops (black sesame and matcha). The toast was super good! Two stacks of thick toasts, sliced in cubes for us. The ice cream scoops were really small tho. Black sesame icecream was good! But the matcha didn't taste like matcha at all. It tasted like... One of the flavours of the Magnolia brand icecream that i can't remember haha...  Anyway it was good as a whole ! Decent price. Like about $8 after tax. My friend's and i would definitely visit again to try the shaved ice desserts."}
{"text":"I was here for their opening and the line was long but worth it! The shaved ice is super fluffy and soft that just melts in your mouth! If you get the classic injeolmi then it's not too sweet which is perfect for me! The place was packed and someone bumped into me and so my ice-cream rolled off but the staff were friendly, and very quick to clean it up! They also gave me another scoop of ice cream which was super awesome of them! Also, i love the chic, cozy interior! Cute decor and kept nicely tidy!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Their bingsu is different compared to the regular ones. Love it! Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"When I came at night, it wasn't too hard to find a table. It's a cute place and very aesthetic. The portions were on the smaller side considering the price. It was decent. I did not enjoy the jammies. The blueberry one was very good !!! 
The shaved ice was creamy and very consistently shaved."}
{"text":"This is best bingsu place I ever had in Toronto. I tried both signature Bingsu. I also ordered fresh mix fruit tea take out, after an hour it still taste very good. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Came here today and tried the Oreo Matcha Bingsu, Mochi Bingsu, and the Red Bean Sticky Rice Cake Toast. They were all well made and a fair portion for the price. The mochi was just chewy enough and paired well with the soybean powder and red bean. They gave a generous amount of Oreo crumbs for the Bingsu and topped it with a dollop of match ice cream. The toast was also surprisingly very good, since many places focused on snow ice or similar desserts can be lacking in other areas. It was filled with mochi, red bean and honey. The atmosphere is also quite comfortable and cozy with an Instagram picture worthy backdrop at the back of the store. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend, and sat near the window. The staff were welcoming, felt at home. The only downside is that the bingsu takes quite a while to make. The taste is great, and the prices are affordable. Great place to hang out and chill with friends!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the bingsu here. Not too sweet and had a good amount of toppings. Ordered the injeolmi bingsu and really enjoyed the mochi bites. Lovely, relaxing interior and I will be back to try the matcha red bean bingsu and a hot tea. Service was quick and friendly - we did not have to wait long at all!"}
{"text":"It seems to me that Korean bingsu has become the newest \"in\" dessert. 

I came here today with a friend and I was really impressed with the interior design of this place. It's modern, chic, \"hipster\", and definitely an Instagrammable location (for those of you who're into that). The employees seemed very polite and were quick workers, tackling on a large lineup at a fairly fast pace. 

I tried the mango jammie bingsu and the shaved ice was a very enjoyable temperature and texture. When you first put it into your mouth, you feel like you have to chew but as soon as it sits on your tongue for a second, it melts into a smoother ice cream texture. The flavour of the bingsu wasn't too sweet or artificial - however, I did find the mango pudding pieces to be a little too artificial and the mango ice cream to be a little too sweet. I totally get that this IS a \"dessert\" after all so it should be sweet but I just found that there was no way I could finish 1 order of this by myself - it's definitely better for sharing.

I think the matcha and red bean one tasted better on an overall because the matcha flavour was more genuine and strong than the mango flavour. It didn't taste like there were any unnecessary added sugars."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite dessert spot! I absolutely love their mango bingsu. I love that they use shaved milk versus shaved ice. Every time I come here I usually split one with my husband. Then one day we decided to get our own, and it was the only time we got super sour mangoes...totally ruined it for us...but I guess the mangoes they had that week weren't ripe. I can only go when they first open. If I try to come in the evening, it is way too packed. The decor is absolutely beautiful and the cashiers have always been friendly."}
{"text":"Love the decor inside, modern And minimalistic. You make the order at the front and pick up your own food and utensils. Although it was self serve the staff was nice and accommodating. I dont like red bean and opted for seasme ice cream instead and they said it would be fine to swap with no charge. The bingsu was so good , esp w the mochi bites in it and the sesame icecream. So refreshing, light & satisfying. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in thinking that we scored a dead night but still ended up waiting upwards of 45 minutes to get our binsu. Everyone was sitting down just waiting so it seemed like it wasn't busy but they were pretty backed up on orders. 

When we finally received ours, it was good but for the price I'm more likely to just continue going to Cups as it's roughly the same price but you get way more even with the small. I just like how this place is a lot closer to me 

Service was OK, considering you just order and wait for your buzzer to buzz but keep in mind that English isn't their first language and it might take a few tries before getting your order in 

I also got the mango frappe which just tasted like watered down mango puree I would recommended avoiding that. 

They're still working out everything as they just opened not too long ago but overall it's not baddd but maybe get some more English fluent workers unless your target market is mandarins and mandarins only"}
{"text":"We had arrived at 1:15 p.m., fifteen minutes after they just opened for the day.  After placing my order, the staff manning the cashier told me that it would take about ten minutes for the dessert to come out.  In fact, it actually took 20 minutes for the dessert to be ready.  The two desserts were also served separately (a good and bad thing; good because you could enjoy the desserts separately without one melting too quickly but bad if I wanted to take the two desserts side-by-side for a better photo composition).

The Injeolmi Bingsu was really good!  It had Korean glutinous rice flour, mochi, sliced almonds, and sweetened red bean paste all atop a bowl of finely shaved ice.  For this bingsu, the shaved ice was like little individual flakes of snow.  It was so soft, refreshing, and not too sweet.  It was light in taste too!  I was really impressed with this.  It tasted like eating snow but was flavoured.  The mochis were chewy, the almonds were so thin and went so well with the shaved ice as did the red bean paste.  The red bean paste wasn't too sweet either.  I couldn't believe how delicious this bingsu was!

After a while, the Matcha Bingsu was served to us too.  The matcha shaved ice was topped with a piece of chocolate, a scoop of matcha ice cream, and sweetened red bean paste.  This dessert had a very obvious matcha taste to it which was good!  Taste-wise, I liked the Injeolmi Bingsu much better since it had so many more toppings on it.  The matcha taste was very good but just more plain."}
{"text":"Came here at around 1:30PM because the shaved ice here looked so aeshetically pleasing and appetizing. We decided to get the matcha flavour (with no red bean). Im glad they have that option because I love matcha but I hate red bean so I'm often upset when places always pair these two flavours together. 

The wait was like 15mins even though there were only like 3 other people in the restaurant. I can't imagine how long the wait would be if this place was full. 

The shaved ice was pretty creamy and the cubes all around the dish were unique; although I'm still not totally sure as to what those are. 

The reason I'm not going to give this place more than 3 stars is because of 1) the wait time and 2) the price. The portion is NOT that big and for around $12, I'd expect a portion or bowl size more gracious, considering I'm paying for ice, milk and flavouring. 

Overall, I'd say to try this place at least once but I'm not sure if I'll be a repeat customer in the future."}
{"text":"Super delicious. I am in love with this place. What an ambience! I loved every flavor of bingsu. Friendly  staff and great service. A chilled out place. We came here with friends and we tried 3 flavors and loved it. The size looks big but we loved it and ordered other flavors. Overall a great experience. Will surely come again."}
{"text":"Been here countless times and decided to give them 5/5. No complaints and the atmosphere and interior is so cute. Definitely recommend this!! Any bingsoo or/citrus drink is so good."}
{"text":"Treats customers poorly and overall terrible customer service. I would advice to avoid at all cost. Especially the employee John, absolutely pathetic."}
{"text":"The drinks were delicious. A bit sweet but okay overall. They put fresh fruits in them. A bit pricey in my opinion. A drink is around $8 and you can finish it real fast."}
{"text":"Tried this place out and I would say if you're coming in a group in the evening, you're most likely waiting for a table. You order your food then wait to pick it up when it's ready. 

The decor inside is nice and is a good place to hang out and meet with friends for dessert! Overall I wouldn't say it's my favourite bingsoo place, but it was still tasty. Would probably come back to try out the litchi infused tea next time."}
{"text":"The decor here is nice and homey with a hint of Korean flavour. The service here, however, was what made my rating go from 3 to 2. The woman that took my order, because English is not her first language, sounded rude. When taking my order she asked 'what do you want' and when I mentioned I had an allergy to nuts, she did not understand and wanted to move on and not necessarily figure out what I am trying to say. Perhaps it's just the language barrier but I felt offended. When she asked for my cash she literally said 'give me the money'. That being said, she did smile and say thank you.

In terms of food, compared to the other bingsu places, Dear and Fro was a miss. The matcha Jammie bingsu lacked real matcha flavour, or any milk flavour. Because they didn't have any more of the jelly, we opted for mochi. The mochi was chewy and soft, one good thing about the dish, but the matcha was lacking. 

We also ordered the honey sticky rice toast with red bean as they didn't have taro filling. This was tasty as the honey gave the toast a sweet aromatic flavour. The sticky rice cake gave it a chewy texture and the soy bean powder on top added flavour to the toast and paired well with the honey. 

The cheese foam on their drinks are also lacking flavour and not salty enough. 

Overall, I don't think I will really come back unless I really want their honey toast. It being so close to Snow Time, I would definitely go there instead."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give this place a try. I've never had bingsu before so I don't have anything to compare it to. 

I came on a Wednesday afternoon and some of the seats were filled but there were a lot of tables with leftover bowls and cups that were sitting there for who knows how long. There were three employees behind the counter that didn't look busy at all. 
My bf and I sat beside the counter and it was a good spot because we were able to see the bingsu being prepared which looked pretty cool. I ordered the mango bingsu to share with my bf. The shaved ice on its own wasn't sweet or bland but I wouldn't eat it on its own. The mango pieces and ice cream definitely \"boosted\" the overall flavour and the dessert as a whole is pleasant. My only complaint is that the mango chunks weren't peeled properly prior so chopping it up so half the time the mango tasted slightly bitter because the skin is still intact. 

Overall it was a decent experience. The weather is getting cooler so I probably won't return until the summer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bingsu in town. I came from Richmond hill to try this new place, the price wasn't cheap but is deserve it!!! Everything looks so cute, very good place for couples or girls night  when we arrived this is after dinner time the line is so long, we were wait for 20min to get seat. So be there earlier...."}
{"text":"Tried out this new place yesterday, it was actually pretty good! To be honest, I was suprised after reading the reviews on Yelp and Google. Personally I think this place definitely deserves a 4 stars. The cashier was super friendly and patient. We ordered the Matcha Bingsu and Red Bean Toast, my friend and I loved it. However, it would be better if there was more toppings on the bingsu. Will be back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago, I fell in love with this place by accident.  Craving something sweet, I was told to come here; a sweet-lover at heart, I didn't need to be told twice.  When I seen the menu, I was a bit freaked out as I didn't recognize the colorful images before me.  I wasn't sure if it was ice cream, or Parmesan cheese covered in fruit and drizzle.  I thought to myself, \"Maybe the picture just made it look like that\", and I gave it a chance.  Moments later, the kind waiter brought me the dish.  I stared at it for a number of moments, before poking at it with my spoon.  It was the trippiest thing I've seen since Woodstock!!  It was tiny, little pieces of ice cream, and it was unusually yummy!  I devoured much of it before tapping out.  Afterwards, I realized I was supposed to stir it all up (ice cream, fruit, and sauces), as it would have given the vanilla shavings more flavour.  I'd never been there before - so I had no idea!  The taste, TEXTURE, and overall experience was just divine.  It's not something you can eat everyday - but definitely something you cannot NOT try!"}
{"text":"This place didn't live up to the hype for me and my YEA.  It's solid but wait a bit to avoid the serious lines.

It's recently soft-opened so exploding with popularity and long lines for the limited space with the cafe.  The cafe is nicely decorated throughout with a mix of round sit-down tables and a tall long bench near towards the back.

TIP: if the cafe is full with no open tables, their unofficial policy for tables is based on the order of the customers.  So squatting on a table while your group orders will not work.

There was definitely a line-up out towards the door when we arrived in the evening around 9pm-ish.  It was a lively atmosphere and it was packed through and through.

The main frustration that I had with the place was that there was no clear person trying to direct traffic and clearing tables of those customers that had finished their dessert to make room for new customers who just ordered.  There was a Dear Fro person trying their best to manage flow of customers but a lot of people in line, like myself, were wondering what do I do when I get my dessert and there is no place to sit because other people are just sitting at tables chatting with empty dessert bowls.  Although the cafe is probably meant for people to enjoy the desserts in a relaxed atmosphere, a grand opening will pretty much blow up that idealism.

I would recommend not coming here until maybe a month or two later when surge of people subside a little bit if you are not a fan of huge crowds.

Now overall, their take on shaved ice was good but not particularly memorable for me.  The shaved ice wasn't overly sweet which I did enjoy against some of the more sweetened versions of shaved ice.  We settled for the strawberry shaved ice as a consolation because their mango shaved ice was so popular that it was sold out.  The texture and mouth-feel of the little shards of shaved iced was like eating little snowflakes.

I wish we had more time to enjoy the atmosphere but we bounced after feeling the deep stares of others waiting for a seat to tuck into their desserts."}
{"text":"Went on weekend after dinner.  Not too full.  We ordered matcha, mango and original.

Liked mango the best.  The shaved ice here is different from Cha Me Cha.  More like little snowflakes or coconut flakes.  We noticed consistency on matcha, mango and original are all different.

All are pretty flavourful.  One is good for sharing between 2 people - hard for one person to finish one plus it gets pretty boring after 10 bites.

Comfortable decor and seating.  Would visit if I am in the area but would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Fruit tea was great! It was a little too sweet for me so next time I would like to get half sweet. The sweetness wasn't like sugar but instead it tasted like honey so I feel that it's a healthier choice for teas!!!

The mango bingsuu did not look right. I felt like I have almond slices instead of mango bing su. I like how they use fresh mangos instead of frozen mangos.

I don't like how the server kept eyeing at our table and trying to rush us out the door when we haven't even finished our drinks!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend during the soft opening event where they were giving out free bingsu. Shaved ice seems to be the trendy dessert nowadays with many different places offering this interesting cold dessert. Dear Fro opened in the same plaza where Snow Time opened. My friend and I lined up for about an hour before getting inside to get our free bingsu. They sell a variety of items ranging from the bingsu, snacks and fruity drinks. The prices are cheaper for the shaved ice dessert but the portions are much smaller. I ordered the mango bingsu as I love mango and have tried other mango bingsus. It's a nice decent dessert café with a nice interior and a good amount of seats that can accommodate roughly 25 people or so. It didn't take long to get our free bingsu dessert. I was surprised the portions were smaller and even more surprised that they didn't have fresh fruits. At other locations that served shaved ice, they usually have fresh fruits. Instead of fresh mango fruit, there were mango pudding bits. My friend who ordered the strawberry bingsu was loaded with fresh strawberry slices. I thought the flavour was good and it was delicious. Nothing really blew my mind away but it was a great dessert. Overall, a decent place to get your shaved ice but I feel you should get more for your money in order to attract customers. Good service, nice décor and decent shaved ice. I would come back."}
{"text":"The stars are based foodwise. I've won an Instagram giveaway where I received 2 free bingsu. I ordered the Oreo bingsu and the Matcha cheese bingsu. It was my first time having a shaved ice dessert in Canada, and I definitely LOVED it. 

Foodwise: The shaved ice for both bingsus was perfectly shaved, so beautiful to the eyes and it literally melts in the mouth. People would usually think that it's too sweet just by looking at them, but the sugar level was on point. Although both were delicious, I found the matcha one a bit plain as everything was matcha (it was also my choice, so not their fault). The oreo bingsu had its top covered with crushed oreo cookies and something else that tasted a little peanuty. And on top of that was a piece of oreo cheesecake, surrounded by mini pieces of oreo. 
Personally, the Oreo bingsu is the winner of all bingsus at that place (although I only tried 2). 

On the downside is the price. An average bingsu is $9-$10, which I find a bit pricey. Also in the pictures the desserts look big, I thought that the size is sharable with a group of 3, 4 people, but when I saw it in person I was surprised that it's quite small (1 or 2 people).

Will go back if/when I crave for bingsu as this is my first and only bingsu place i've been here."}
{"text":"Dear Fro was a rather disappointing experience but this review is solely for the jammie bingsu. I came in super impressed; the interior and decor was just so cozy and inviting and we were so excited to try out the new creation in their jammie series - bingsu flavored shaved ice I thought! Unfortunately it wasn't all that great and I had wished we went for the 'normal' variety. 

My first impression of the strawberry jammie bingsu was that the shaved ice looked like coarsely grated cheese. I've never seen bingsu so coarse before and it resulted it in a rougher and drier texture. It simply wasn't as smooth as other bingsu places. I was expecting some condensed milk or strawberry sauce layered on top, or throughout the bowl but there was none of that either. You're left with a a very dry bowl of underwhelming bingsu. Flavor wise, the strawberry was fairly artificial (think strawberry pocky) and there wasn't any real strawberry in this bowl. The bingsu would have definitely benefited from real strawberries. The strawberry pudding was fairly gelatinous and was underwhelming as well."}
{"text":"Trekked from Toronto to Scarborough to try this dessert place. We ordered the Matcha Bingsu, Mochi Bingsu, and Mochi Sandwich. The bingsus are made of ice cream with shaved ice on top and some toppings depending on the flavor of what you ordered. The mochi sandwich has mochi and red bean as fillings. All of the dishes are good but nothing great especially if you compare it to Bang Bang or Ihalo. Also, it took a while for the orders to come out, we waited more than 15 minutes to get the first order. If you live in Scarborough, it is not bad to put the effort to go there and try but if you live in Toronto, it is definitely not worth the half hour trip."}
{"text":"I went to dear fro the day of its grand opening. Evening. Rather since the morning was insane (there was a long lineup outside). We waited for maybe 10 minutes before getting a table which isnt too bad for me (anyone remember lineups at tetsu when it first opened?). 
I had the injeolmi bingsu because that is my gateway drug for my love of shaved ice. It was a lot smaller than what the pics on the wall showed with a lot less toppings. There wasn't enough roasted soybean powder for all of the shaved ice in the bowl so by the end of it i was definitely rationing my powder per spoonful.
My favorite shaved ice place is still the cups, but i hear great things about snow time which is in the same plaza as dear fro."}
{"text":"I came to Dear & Fro on a Sunday afternoon. The place wasn't too busy, about a quarter to half of the store was full. I believe they only take cash and debit, because their card machine states \"debit only\". 

Ambience - If I were to describe the decor and vibe at Dear & Fro, it's \"millennial\". Picture hipster greenery, gold decor, oak wood benches, marble tables and bold black framed windows. Regardless where you sit, it's photograph worthy. It's best known for their green wall with the neon sign \"Treat Yo Self\", however I don't recommend sitting by the neon sign because a lot of people came by to take pictures of it. It has a chill vibe and is a cute and pretty place to hang out with friends and grab some tasty desserts.

Service - The service is limited since it's almost fully self serve. When you enter, you're greeted by the front staff, where you'll grab your own menus and table. When you're ready to order, you then go to the cashier to order and pay for your food, then given a buzzer to get your food when ready. The food only took 10 minutes to prepare. Depending on how much you order, you'll need to be careful when carrying your tray, because the trays are a bit small. Other than that, the staff was nice and I had no issues. 

Food - I ordered the mango bingsuu and lychee fruit tea. I really enjoyed the mango bingsuu, because it has more flavour than other shaved ice places I've been too. This place uses milk shavings which makes the ice more creamy and the fruit toppings and ice cream makes it very tasty. The portions are a tad bit smaller than other shaved ice places, but more than enough for one person, since I shared it with my bf. The lychee fruit tea flavour is very subtle, and a bit flavourless. Kind of tastes like overpriced fruit water. I expected it have a bit more tea flavour or fruit flavour.

Recommendation - I definitely recommend coming here. I plan to come back to try some of the other desserts and the other bingsuu flavours. I'd probably skip the lychee fruit tea and try something else next time. Pretty ambiance, nice service and tasty desserts, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Came here one night with Jen to grab desserts in the midst of this crazy plaza.
Dear & Fro focuses on Taiwanese shaved ice desserts in the area.  This is quite the popular place, the inside is cute with ample booth seating and its clean.
Their menu has a great assortment catering for those with different taste buds. 
As for shaved us, we decided to share their Berry Bingsu; surrounded with various types of berries served with shaved ice and ice cream! yum. 
I must say whatever size we took, it was a lot, however just wished they served it in a bigger bowl since a good portion of the toppings were falling off when we initially started eating it lol. 
Overall great place to catch catch a dessert whether its beverage of shaved ice."}
{"text":"The bingsu was good, but we had to wait for 30 minutes to get it after we paid. Avoid this place for now, they seem to be working out the glitches to their ordering system."}
{"text":"I purchased the strawberry jammie.
The flavor of this strawberry jammie tasted like pockys with small marshmallow chunks. What I didn't like was that the snow was too large the shaven. Appearance of the dessert was good but flavor wasn't to my preference. Prices for all their desserts could be a bit cheaper and sizes a bit bigger in order to justify what they're selling.

 Interior of the restaurant was actually very nice and modern and a great place for young customers to come and hang out on a regular basis. But other than that I wouldn't really come back to try the other flavors as this one time kind of threw me off and the prices are too expensive for me."}
{"text":"Lost a star due to service. The hostess was horrible with allocating tables. There were empty tables that could have been utilized. Very good mango shaved ice cream. Try the chewy toast too!"}
{"text":"I came here on Oct 22nd when it was said that there would be free giveaways. Yet the staff behind the cashier said they've been ran out when serving me, and I didn't get a free giveaway even if I told her it was my birthday that day. :(  I was so disappointed with it although I ended up with a 20% off discount as usual after the free giveaway period.

After all, the vibe of the café is really good. Suitable for people to hang out and relax. The bingsu is decent and worth trying. I would say one bingsu could be shared by two people if it is just for tasting at leisure. The price is just ok."}
{"text":"This place just opened when we went to partake in the bingsoo craze.  It was delicious.  BlogTO hasn't failed met yet with their food recommendations.  I would not recommend though, the honeyed toast.  It was uninspired and uninteresting.  But the bingsoo -- can't wait to go back and try it again and in different flavours!"}
{"text":"Came here with few friends for opening special for their Bingsu. Ordered the mango Bingsu while both my friends got the Matcha flavor. Came in a paper cup, while the portion is not as good as the other places I've been to the quality of the shaved ice seems better and creamier. The mango nuggets were not real mangoes it had a good texture and tasted good. The decor was decent. I like the lights hanging down the ceiling."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Dear Fro is my favourite bingsu café by far. The desserts are delicious, the café is renovated and well decorated, the desserts came quickly and the service was good! Most importantly, everything tastes great. 

We ordered the matcha bingsu and the mango toast. Both were amazing! The ice has a rich creamy matcha flavour rather than just condensed milk ice. Other cafés have ice that is lacking in flavour but this one really comes together nicely. The mango toast smells and tastes divine - the pieces of toast are pre-sliced and are toasted with butter. 

I really enjoyed my experience here, especially compared to Snow Time which is next door. You do need to order and pay at the counter before, but this is similar to many other cafés. Definitely coming back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"June 8, 2018 - I've never had Bingsu before, but I'm happy I decided to go and try it at D&F! 

We ordered Mango Bingsu, Oreo Cookie Bingsu and the Salmonberry mousse.

I liked the Oreo cookie Bingsu, but not as much as the Mango Bingsu. The mangos were sweet and tasted so good and the Bingsu was creamy! The other flavours I want to try are strawberry and matcha. The Salmonberry mousse wasn't what I expected, I thought it would be a cold drink, but it was warm. 

I will definitely go back to try other Bingsu!"}
{"text":"I only recently found out what bingsu is - Korean shaved ice (milk) dessert. A friend had recently suggested this place because it was \"hot and new\" but we ended up at another place nearby on that occasion.

I had an opportunity to introduce an out of town friend my new discovery so it was a good chance to try this place. We must have gotten there at just the right time to find a parking spot and get a table. The crowd came in right after us and there was a long lineup for most of the time that we were there. The decor is very nice but we found the seating a little cramped. The parking lot is terrible.

I ordered a mango bingsu and my friend ordered a waffle with mango and strawberries. It took a while for our order to be prepared but it was worth the wait. At $23.54 (with tip), however, it wasn't exactly cheap. And there's no table service.

Nice ambiance, good food, long wait times, poor parking, high prices. You decide."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of bingsu after trying it at Snow Time. But I decided to give it another try at this place and I've converted! I tried the Oreo Matcha and Oreo Cheesecake bingsus. The Oreo Matcha only had a scoop of matcha ice cream on top and there was no other matcha component. There were oreo cookie crumbs and mini oreos and even though there wasn't that much matcha it was yum. The Oreo Cheesecake bingsu had a piece of cheesecake and then half oreo crumbs and half some other type of crumb (tasted like ovaltine) with mochi and mini oreos. The actual cheesecake didn't taste good, it wasn't a traditional cheesecake and had a weird chewy texture, but all the flavours were otherwise great. The oreo cheesecake one was way bigger than the oreo matcha. It's definitely one that should be shared between two people. The shaved ice melts in your mouth and has a slight sweet flavour. Would recommend!!! Mmm"}
{"text":"Visited this place after we won two bingsu desserts during their Christmas Contest on Instagram. Pretty little place in a horrible-parking wise plaza. I really love the inside of the store! It was so chic and pretty! The seats were really comfy as well. The employees were all very nice as well. I thought the Bingsu was delicious. We got the Oreo Cheesecake and the Mango Bingsu. I really love how the mango is infused into the shaved ice. It was mango flavored shaved ice!! I really loved it! The oreo-cheesecake on the other hand was very simple. I felt that there was not enough \"cheesecake\" taste in the oreo cheesecake slice they put on top of the bingsu. The mini oreos and mochis were a great touch. Also, they decorated the mango bingsu with fresh mangos! 

The Bingsu was decorated very nicely and the employees were soooo efficient when it came to making sure the tables were clutter free and cleaned. 

I couldn't comment on the prices as I didn't have to pay for any. However, I did get a glimpse at the prices and felt they were a little steep. I don't know if I would pay 10-13 dollars for their portions. 

All in all, i loved it! Might be back if someone decides to treat me! #brokestudent."}
{"text":"Decor, 3.5/5.0
Taste, 1.0/5.0

Came here on a Tuesday night, and this place was relatively busy since it really spend a lot on advertisement. ;-)(that's the reason why I am here Lol..)          

The decor was nice and modern, which really deserved 3 star due to the efforts they put into, however, as a dessert place, they didn't prepare quality foods that could match the price. 

Ordered the strawberry bingsu, it was just ok. The ice itself does have the strawberry flavor, but was tasted like it was made from the Strawberry Milk Powder as most Taiwanese shaved ice does, rather than the real milk. 

My friend who was a crazy matcha lover ordered their matcha bingsu, and he told me it was made from like lower level green tea powder not the matcha powder, the taste was just so bland compared to the Japanese matcha ice cream we had at Tsujiri or Tendou. 

Definitely won't return. There are still better cafes which serve authentic Korean bingsu and ran by Korean guys not Chinese. Will go Cups Markham instead to satisfy our cravings."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the past few months and I can honestly say I've never left disappointed! 
I'm normally not the biggest fan of shaved ice but the bingsu here is very milky- it's in a whole other category of \"shaved ice\". I'd say the texture and taste is very similar to ice cream except it's lighter without compromising the flavour. I've gotten the green tea and the nut one and they're both amazing! 
The atmosphere is great. It's very cozy with comfortable seating. They've really done their best to make it \"insta worthy\" with a cherry blossom tree on one side of the restaurant and an aesthetic shrubbery wall on the other."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this place. Even though there was a line up we were quickly given a number and seated within 5 minutes. To be honest I'm getting a bit bored with shaved ice after being to Snow Time so many times. The shaved ice here is excellent if not better than Snow Time. I found the shaved ice here to be a bit more sweet. I aslo ordered a yam rice cake topped with a layer of melted cheese. Its worth a try but not something I would crave for. Pricing is comparable to other shaved ice places. There is a bit more seating than Snow Time. Service was quite fast for how busy it was on a Friday night. I gave Snow Time a 5 star so I have to be fair and give this place a 5 star."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the bingsu at this location, mainly go for the fruit based ones. They are really refreshing and honestly such a great dessert to share. For $10 a bingsu, you can comfortably share with two people or more depending on how hungry you are.

The flavours are subtle but still really good, especially if you aren't into really sweet and overpowering desserts. I think this is the perfect date location, just because of the amazing interior decorations and designs, very insta worthy.

Great atmosphere, great assortment, great food."}
{"text":"The smell inside the place is just too strong. It smelled like sweat... no air conditioning either to make sure that it doesn't smell bad. As a result it was very humid and sticky inside"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is gorgeous, the presentation of their desserts are instagramable but for it's price and the bingsu that one can get across the street at Snow Time or other bingsu places like Soul Cafe or The Cups this place is a rip off for it's portion size and the limited and little toppings they put with one's bingsu. I feel that it's not even worthy of being called bingsu as it's shaved ice is too coarse in comparison to other bingsu spots which I personally prefer better. Even their litchi iced infused tea was too basic for what it was worth and a bit of a let down for me. It just didn't win me over in texture, price and portion."}
{"text":"Nice design of the store, you can grab your dessert or drinks here and chitchat with your friends"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. Nice decor, great bingsu, and look at the portion man. Instead of their oreo cheesecake, i asked for the sesame ice cream, taste was suprisingly good. Their shaved ice was fluffy and very creamy - not icy/crunchy at all. Well, price could be better but the milkiness makes up for it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend found this place on instagram so we decided to give it a try.

First thing I noticed when I got in is the place is super aesthetic. It's filled with unorthodox furniture and decor which gave the restaurant a hipster cafe kind of feel.

We ordered a Matcha Bingsu ( ~$10) which was smaller than I expected but it did taste good. We also got some sort of baked honey toast (~$5) which took a long time to come but was a good pairing to the Bingsu. 

Overall, come here for instagram bangers and a good but small treat."}
{"text":"I didn't know the existence of Dear & Fro until a friend of mine told me about it. It's hard to spot in a plaza with colorful signs like coco and snowtime. If you ever had snowtime, or cups, it's a similar but different concept. It's shaved ice still, but instead of layering the flavour with the ice,the ice itself is flavoured.

It's a medium sized dessert store with very cute decors. You feel girlier than you usually are (to the guys that come here, I'm sorry if you feel that way lol!). It's a very instagram-able, snapchat-able place. 

You order in the front, and take one of those  vibrating disks back to your table. It will vibrate and make a sound when your dessert is ready for pickup in the front. The size of the bingsoo is significantly smaller compared to places like snowtime and cups. I personally don't ever finish the bingsoo at snowtime and cups,so this sizing is perfect for me. I love the flavoured shaved ice because it makes my life easier - you don't need to mix any layers. The \"cheese\" that comes with the bingsoo in the particular section tastes interesting..but I love the texture..it's addicting!"}
{"text":"Since it just opened a few weeks ago, everything is still not organized. This place does not give out numbers when you are lining up, so you just talk to the waitress and she will \"remember\" you (that's what she said).
I ordered the strawberry and mango binsu, both tasted like artificial flavors. They probably just pay to advertise, totally not worth it..
If you really want to try a real Korean shaved ice, you should go to Snow Time instead, which is in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Opened just this past Tuesday, Dear Fro is currently offering 10% off during their soft opening. It's spacious and nicely decorated inside. Service was friendly but slow though (waited 20 minutes for my Mango mousse). 

The menu focuses on fruitier drinks and Korean bingsoos. I tried the Nuts Bingsoo ($9.95) and while it can be considered pricey for its size and amount of ingredients (nuts, injeolmi powder, black sesame ice cream and condense milk), it didn't bother us so much because it still tasted good. I only wish the bingsoo had more ingredients besides the top layer. 

Their drinks on the other hand was quite enjoyable and the main reason I rated this place 4/5. I ordered the Salmonberry mousse that was topped with cheese + whip cream mousse and went back the next day to try the Mango mousse ($5.25). The drink was light, fruity and refreshing, the cheese mousse was fluffy and not overly salty. What made this drink special was the addition of chopped/blended strawberries, salmonberries and mango. I loved that every sip of this drink was flavorful and had texture. My friends tried the Orange Infused tea and Blueberry Infused tea ($5.95). Again, they used real fruit juice and added slices of orange and lime and mixed blueberries into the drinks. This made it very refreshing! 

I think this store is off to a good start and is another great alternative for people who want to hang out in this area. Fingers crossed that the staff will review customers' comments and continue to improve."}
{"text":"They have a really good drink menu and their drinks are quite good. If you live close by right now they have a 2 for 1 deal which will make the drinks even more cheaper. I went to Dear and Fro because of the Bingsu. It looked enticing and I really wanted to try it. It was delicious and the ice milk is soft and melts so nicely in your mouth. It's not the best in Toronto but it's quite good."}
{"text":"Came here to try their mochi bingsu and it did not disappoint. The shaved ice was very creamy and the texture is soft and velvety. The toppings added additional flavour and texture to the bingsu. We also tried the nut bingsu - the roasted caramelized almonds were my favourite part along with the black sesame ice cream. Service was friendly and they also have cold/hot water to serve for yourself. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying bingsoo!!! 

Not sure what the hype is because it's just flavoured ice. I feel like the price is very high compared to the portion they give you. 

Tried the Matcha and red bean. Taste wise, it was like green tea ice cream u can get from a supermarket. 

Besides the food, my favourite part was the interior design! Decor was very cute and would love taking pictures with the green leafy wall! 

Will be back to try the original bingsoo!!!"}
{"text":"Got the mango Bingsoo! 

I really like the texture of the Bingsoo here. It has the texture of shaved chocolate, and tastes a lot more creamy and milky than other places. Since the shaved ice is thicker, it also takes longer to melt. The mango was no doubt very sweet as it's currently in season. It's also topped with mango ice cream too. 

You pay at the counter and they'll give you a buzzer. This is a great place to hangout and chat for hours!"}
{"text":"I just found my favourite to-go place if I ever crave Bingsu! Excellent customer service even though they are super packed! They are so dedicated to find seats for you and ask customers to squeeze over to accommodate more customers. Their bingsu is heavenly, grated adorable flakes with just the right amount of sweetness. They have a lot of bingsu selections and they even have toasts! If you ever feel hungry as well. The red bean sticky rice toast is definitely recommended, I love it so much! The staff working there are super nice, they definitely match with the restaurant's motto, ????. Recommended for anyone to visit to experience bingsu heaven!"}
{"text":"Okay the mango toast is MASSIF. I couldn't even finish it. But the freshest ingredients. Mango was on point! It took a long time to make but so worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Late night dessert time! It's nice to find a nice place that opens late to meet up with friends for some dessert and drinks! Tried their classic mochi bingsu. Apparently their shaved ice are made with milk instead water. Other places are usually made with water.
Also tried the litchi infused tea which was amazingly refreshing even on a cool fall night! 
Can't wait to try their other bingsu flavours and tea next time!"}
{"text":"The good: I ordered the Oreo Cheesecake Bingsu and absolutely loved it! I really liked how the shaved ice was flavoured with milk. It was a good dessert that wasn't too sweet. It's so good that I crave it after dinner. 

The bad: A little on the pricey side at $10.95 but this one is the bigger bowl. I think this is for 2 people. 

Yummy!"}
{"text":"Ordered: 
Oreo cheesecake bingsu

Expectation:
Creamy
Refreshing

Reality:
It was contrasting. The sweetness of the oreo balances the savoury soy bean powder. I just wish there was something better about it."}
{"text":"I visited this place three times just because I love their matcha cheese jelly bingsu so much but... I took a few stars off for their service. Their staff don't seem to speak English very well but up until my last visit, they were still very courteous. But last night, the middle-aged staff member working was extremely rude to us. We originally stopped by their café to do some work on my laptop and ordered two bingsus to enjoy. After devouring them, we noticed the bar/long table at the back was near empty so we decided to move there to continue working. The moment we sat down, we were scolded by the staff (in Mandarin, which neither of us speak very well) to leave since she wanted to keep the spacious table clear for potential larger groups of customers. No large group of customers came. I think she could've handled the situation a lot better--for example, if a large group of customers came and she asked us nicely to move, we would've obliged of course. The staff's lack of respect towards paying customers turns me off from coming back."}
{"text":"Dear & Fro hasn't exactly been a preferred destination of mine for bingsu/shaved ice. It's all right, though other places do it much better. 

On my most recent visit, I was only interested in getting a drink. I'm also not a fan of mousse/foam drinks but the Fresh Pineapple with Green Tea drink looked refreshing and I decided to order it. I don't know why I bother looking at pictures for some places, because what I got in the end was not the same. While the pictures did not indicate any foam as part of the drink, about a third of the cup was just foam. The foam and the cold green tea is just an odd combination that does not add any value. I actually got less for what was paid for ($6.95+tax) because of the thick foam. When I went back to ask about the drink, my concerns were dismissed pretty quickly as \"foam from blending the drink.\" This did not turn out to be an honest answer as the foam didn't dissolve and just stayed there even after finishing the drink. The picture and description is extremely misleading; if pineapple and green tea is all that's served, why is there foam when the other items specifically mention the foam and show a layer of it in the picture?"}
{"text":"2.5 for the Bingsu + 0.5 for the Setup

Coming here during a winter afternoon means no wait and you can get some quiet moments to share with your friends. Loves the decor and the quaint vibe. The seats are comfy and great to just \"chill\" with some bingsu.

The menu has such good professional photos. They all looked delicious.But I guess photos are just for references only. 

Blueberry Bingsu ($10.55) has hardly any berries!! not even half of what the photo shown. I felt a little ripped off even with the actual size of the bingsu itself. The milky snow does have a nice texture which I enjoyed. Nuts Bingsu ($9.95) has these caramelized nuts and sweet soy powder was quite good!

With all these Bingsu joint popping up everywhere, the competition would be fierce as even in this small plaza alone now have 3 places snow ice! 

I might come back for the nice vibe but I am not sure if I going to pay that much for a petite dessert like that.

PS My friend finished his in 5 minute!"}
{"text":"This is the best bingsu in the area! I come about once a month. I love that they're shaved ice is made out of the real flavour not just the ice with some syrup on it. I also like that its not melting when you get it so you can eat the shaved ice right to the bottom!"}
{"text":"This is something that sits close to becoming an ice cream replacement for me. The serving is definitely for 2+ and ideal for summer time!"}
{"text":"The place was aesthetically nice, great for pictures.

We ordered the matcha bingsu. The bowl was smaller than I expected, but it is perfect for one person. It costs about $10, and tasted pretty average compared to other dessert places. Personally, I didn't like the green rectangular things on the side too. It's so hard to explain the taste, but the moment I took a bite, I immediately spat it out. 

We also ordered honey toast, as you can see from the picture. I think it was the best part. It was crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside. The ice cream was pretty average, tasted like store bought ones. 

Customer service was good, but not extraordinary."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert.  The place isn't too big so on the weekend it can get busy.  Had the matcha shaved ice and I'm glad I was able to share it with my friend because it's way too milky for me.  Also paying $11 bucks is not worth it for shaved ice and ice cream.  I did enjoy the matcha jelly that came with it."}
{"text":"Came here for some shaved ice desert and ended up with the strawberry shaved iced. Was good and service was okay."}
{"text":"Definitely does not live up to the hype. 

I had their new Earl Grey shaved ice. It was a very small portion (about a cup) for about $12, and the flavours did not match; there was mangoes and pieces of bread(??) with coconut cream and a mint leaf. The presentation was also messy and did not look like the ones in the picture.

I waited about 20 minutes for take out, their service is way too long and I was extremely unsatisfied. Go to Snow Time, it's across the street ;)"}
{"text":"Tried this dragon fruit with cheese milk foam, the taste of dragon fruit is very light, the cheese foam taste like cream cheese. Overall it's pretty good combined."}
{"text":"Today is the perfect weather for a cold treat and it also happened to coincide with the soft opening of Dear & Fro so I decided to drop by to check it out.

I ordered the Blueberry Bingsu ($10.55) which consisted of a mix of strawberries and blueberries on a mountain of shaved ice, sprinkled with a little injeolmi (soybean powder) and topped with a scoop of strawberry ice cream and a small chocolate marker. The bingsu was just ok. The ice cream was your ordinary supermarket variety. The fruit was fresh but I found the shaved ice to not be as fluffy as the one from The Cups and after the initial top layer of injeolmi was eaten, the shaved ice was fairly flavourless. Sizewise there is only one choice and the size here seems to be almost the same as (if not smaller than) the small cup size at The Cups but the price is much higher.

The space, though is nice and it would be a good place to hang out with friends. However, given that The Cups is opening another location in Markham soon, I probably will not be returning here."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out since Snow Time (their competition in the same plaza) had a long wait time. We should have taken the underwhelming crowd as a huge red flag; we still continued and gave them a shot. First off, their pricing, they were charging  $10.50 for all flavours of Bingsu bowls. Second, it tasted like flattened Dip N Dots, mind you i've tried many other Bingsu spots and know that it doesn't taste like literal shaved-ice, but fluffy snow flurries instead. Lastly, they gave about two predetermined toppings per flavour. What bothered me about the toppings was the lack of layering, they put zero effort into it and simply just added toppings on top of their \"Bingsu\".  Although the food part wasn't the best, the customer service was good and the cashier was very friendly and quick. Just save yourself the time and money and head over to Snow Time or Soul Cafe near Yonge St instead."}
