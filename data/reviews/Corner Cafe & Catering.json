{"text":"My son and I went here for breakfast while he was in town. Don't let the outside fool you. It looks like an office space on the outside, but it's not like that at all on the inside. Loved this place.  Great mom and pop shop. Super friendly, good food, and large portions. Felt like going home for breakfast on a Sunday morning. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Not amazing by any stretch. I eat here because it's close and cheap and not McDonald's.  Typical family greasy spoon, very few items are actually fresh.  Canned and frozen are pretty much the norm. That being said, staff is efficient and food is warm. Prices are stoopid cheap. I'm tempted to try breakfast, possibly more their Forte."}
{"text":"I have gotten breakfast majority of the time I come here. I recently tried a lunch special some kind of beef tips.... not a fan at all. The breakfast here though is amazing... the steak and eggs combo with hash browns is the best. If you visit I would stick with breakfast food and it's super cheap so that's a plus."}
{"text":"For a quick and cheap bite this place is amazing!

When my friend pulled in here I was a little caught off guard, not really knowing what to expect. But once we walked inside; it  was pretty cool there, I really liked how there were records lining the walls and random \"home\" touches lined against that some classic yellow flower wallpaper.  

It's seat yourself, but in no time the waitress brings the menus and gets your drinks. The menu is simple but the prices are amazing!!! You can tell this place is a favorite of the locals. There were several customers that came in after us, that our waitress already knew their name and drink order before they even sat down. Now, that's great customer service with a down home southern feel!

I went with the breakfast special, two eggs, your choice of meat (ham, bacon, turkey sausage, sausage) and side (grits or home fries) with your choice of a biscuit or toast.  And did I mention that all of that is less than $4!!!

The portion sizes here are excellent, I was more than pleased when it came out, I chose my eggs scrambled, with home fries, toast and bacon. There were plenty of home fries which tasted great, huge chucks of potatoes with just the right amount of seasoning. My eggs were scrambled hard, just as I requested and the bacon was crispy. Delish! I enjoyed everything on my plate, but definitely left some behind. 

I really enjoyed my meal, strongly recommend you stopping by for a bite! I know I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my work and serves several simple pleasure meals at a good price. Don't expect a lot of frills and thrills when it comes to the sophistication of the meals or the decorations in the place, but I find the space homey and everyone who works there is extremely friendly and helpful. 

I've only done lunch here and my favorite dish by far is the buffalo chicken salad. I would say it goes heavier on the buffalo chicken than the salad. But hey, I'm a guy and it fits my definition of a salad pretty well. I also enjoy the gyro platter, but it is enough to put you into a coma for the afternoon, so eat with caution!  

Unfortunately I haven't done breakfast (I struggle enough to get in before the start of work), but will need to check it out sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Not exactly a cool place, but the price definitely was. For was good too. Has a real diner feel. Make sure your home fries or hah browns aren't cooked in bacon grease if you are a vegetarian (our make sure they are if you are, I guess)."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I ordered a grilled cheese on rye with eggs that were perfectly cooked. The staff is quick, friendly and will ensure you have a hearty and delicious meal. I would definitely come back if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"We normally delivery at work 2-3 or 4 times a week. The week before the 4th, we were told that there would be a new menu and a price increase. Normally price increases means .20, .30 cents, but these people have gone up dollar amounts. I ordered cornbeef hash, grits, and eggs which cost $7.99. A co-worker ordered a ham and cheese omelet which cost him $7 bucks... no sides or anything. The pricing is ridiculous. This is not IHOP quality food. I guess we will be going to IHOP for now on since we are paying these type prices. 85% of the time, the eggs are not done anyway. The only thing that will be missed about this place is the fact that they deliver."}
{"text":"The Corner Cafe is the quintessential \"meat & three\" type restaurant. Situated in industrial Arrowood and a 1/2 mile from I-77 and I-485, The Corner is the perfect breakfast and lunch place for folks who work in the area and travelers passing through. The food is consistent and good. Their menu has daily specials and vegetables plates as well as Greek specialties. Faye greets you at the door and treats you like she really cares. Be sure to check out the collection of vinyl LP covers lining the wall!"}
{"text":"Had a Breakfasts meeting last week & enjoyed a wonderful breakfast.  I imagine my cholesterol jumped, however it was delicious food.  Steak Omelet, I'm thinking imitation steak but no, also with 3 types of cheeses what could go wrong.  You would think that with that may types of cheeses it would be heavy but no just the right blend & amount cheese & steak.  Home Fries come with it and all I can say is I hope your hungry.  The portion is quite large.  I'm guessing about 1/3 of my plate was home fires.  Overall service was good and food good, price is average for a dinner type atmosphere.  Definitely will add them to my list of restaurants to revisit."}
{"text":"Great local spot with reliable home cooked favs as well as variety to satisfy any palate. Used to be my go to spot when working in the area and I love the owner who is working daily."}
{"text":"Was on our way to IHOP and the father in law decided we would try this instead...
Seat yourself and the waitress makes her way over and asks what you're drinking and coughs on you. Great start. Got my watered down coffee like 10 mins later when there was only 2 other tables there. She must be the cook too. I got an Omlette and toast and homefries with a side of corned beef hash. The daughter got a waffle and the father in law got an egg platter. Food took about half an hour. Daughters waffle was the best thing we got. Oh Ps they don't have a kids menu...or at least never offered us one. My Omlette was burnt. Like brown. All over. Homefries came out with onions in them ... menu didn't say they came with onions... nor did anyone ever ask if I wanted onions. Did I mention they were barely cooked, my daughter thought they were mashed potatoes. Corned beef hash was obv canned but hey...it was better than anything else on my plate. 
Still want IHOP even though 5 hours after eating this I'm still burping up onions I never asked for."}
{"text":"Great food. Great down-home atmosphere and friendly staff. Breakfast is wonderful and the coffee is good. Waffle house is crowded yet Corner Cafe is better all the way around."}
{"text":"Hands down the best French toast I have ever had. We couldn't even leave the parking lot without sharing how great an experience we had. You can't go wrong with their French toast or classic omelettes! Service was good and the owner was wonderful! Great environment and prices are more than reasonable. Breakfast is a must!"}
