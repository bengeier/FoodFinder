{"text":"Stopped by to pick up dinner. Wait time was about 15-20 min but definitely worth the wait. Ordered a couple of pupusas and platanos fritos to go and they were made fresh which is why there was a small wait time. I would recommend calling ahead if planning to pick up an order. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant itself was really clean. Ended up being a great dinner option and paid less then 15 dollars for 2 people! Very affordable and with every penny."}
{"text":"Food was extremely terrible, and service was slow... When server finally attended our table she was extremely rude... Best thing on their menu was French fries."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. The lady that works at the Cheyenne location was extremely rude. We asked for the check and some to go boxes and she never returned to our table and started doing other things. The list can go on about all the things that went wrong but all I know is I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Its Salvadorian food NOT MEXICAN FOOD! Amazing Pupusas, very authentic. Friendly staff. Great value. Would highly recommend this place for some real Pupusas. They have a dine in area and a take out. Everything is made to order so it takes about 30mins for your order. Salvadorian Horchata is not the same taste as Mexican horchate, its much heavier and has a caramel flavor."}
{"text":"I just went here and I when I sat down the waitress just came and gave us the menus and didn't even say a word then walked away.. a couple walked in and she right away asked them what they wanted to drink when she hadn't even asked us, then 10 mins later she came and asked us what we wanted to drink and I ordered my food , my brother still needed a minute to see what he wanted then she came back and he just ordered a cheeseburger .. the waitress brought mine and my daughters food and we ate but my brothers food never ever came so I just went to pay and she even asked me about the cheeseburger so they knew about it and not once informed us it would be out soon or even checked on us .. I was so mad I just paid and left, didn't leave a tip.. it was poor service , they don't even care about their customers"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful lunch. I wasn't sure what to order from the menu so I got recommendations from the waitress. It was really good and everyone enjoyed it. The restaurant itself was very clean and comfortable. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So I've been eating at this restaurants since they open the first location, but the location at Cheyenne  Service sucks... we came in to dine inn and they had me waiting for an hour...and asked for my food and the response was it's going to take more time, because we are working on take out orders first...wtf... my kids walked out hungry  Never ever going back..."}
{"text":"I've tried their chicken soup and it's really good and filling!"}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy a quick pupusa fix.  Their pupusa are some of the largest around and all under$2! I just wish they had a greater variety of fillings like potato or asada.  Also, it would have been nice to have chips and salsa while waiting."}
{"text":"The restaurant hours say they close at 9:30pm im here at 8:45pm doors locked workers ignored us!!!"}
{"text":"Always good papusas, always takes a few mins to be served due to them hand making them and cooking fresh when you order. So come when you have some time to spare."}
{"text":"The food is great of course, but the service here is horrible. The sad part is, it isn't the waitresses fault. They are just way too under staffed. While eating I've seen 3 groups of people leave because they couldn't get any service. Luckily we came early."}
{"text":"Popusas were good... Salsa that came with it was really bad it was like water , they had a lot(7) of waitresses but none came by to ask if everything was fine or anything ....if I ever go I'll go for the popusas to go and eat them with my own home made salsa instead of that no flavor ass salsa."}
{"text":"Called to put in an order, left me on hold for 15 minutes. Called back and they left the phone off the base and there's a busy tone which means 20 minutes later no customer service. Don't call in to put a order."}
{"text":"I was soo hungry, so i decide to eat pupusas and i choice this place but I KNOW THAT THEY TAKE TO LONG TO make THE ORDERS SO I DECIDE TO Call and place a ORDER AND PICK IT UP,  so i order 2 pupusas of chicharon and 3 revueltas i reaped to the waitress the same order 3 times to make sure she understand and after that she   told me to go in 30mins so i did when i got there i went to the cashier  to pay and instead of  5 pupusas she  wrote 8 pupusas and i told her i order 5 pupusas not 8 and i saw in her face a mad/rude expression so she changed the order to what i wanted so she told me the amount for 5 pupusas was 10.54 so i gave her 11 dollars  and she take it but she didn't give me my change back and the receipt, i decide to set in the table to eat there,and went she come back with the order , i talk her that i decide to eat in the table instead of take it togo,and she bring me some plates but she just trow them in the table and she walk away, i was wanted a drink cause inside of this place is really hot but she even ask me if i want a drink o no?? I was there 2/8/2014  1:30pm i didnt see the name of the waitress but she was soo rude/mad. And the pupusas were BURM from the botton side and the top side was ok, AND SINCE THE WAITREESS SHE BRING THE PLATES, she never come back in to my table!! For me  It was the worst service i ever had."}
{"text":"Did I finally find a restaurant that can make REAL FLAN??? YES! I've never tried Pupusas, maybe I just don't have the taste buds for them but were flavorless, greasy and filling.  I will try something else next time and update =)"}
{"text":"For those of you who wanna try something different and delicious this is the spot!! From eating Platanos Fritos (fried plantains) for breakfast to eating the mostpopular dish of Pupusas for dinner. I love everything in the menu, never tried the Salvadorian tamales? Well try them they're soooo good!!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The pupusas ok but the owner or employees have the air off inside, is really hot! Is just not right to save some money, i will never go back. Las pupusas estan bien pero tienen el aire condicionado apagado adentro, ya van dos veces que voy y es ridiculo, estoy sudando como loco, solo por ahorrar dinero en electricidad, pero en la cocina y en la caja registradora si tienen ventiladores, cuando vi la temperatura estaba en 88F, la encargada dijo: oh! Lo voy a bajar mas, la estupida lo bajó a 85, maldita gente que no considera que un niño que vaya a comer a ese restaurante se puede desidratar, gente ignorante."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service on the other hand not so great. We order 2 chicken pupusas, 3 mixed, super nachos no sour cream, onion rings, and al pastor torta. First thing, we start order, I understand it is a hispanic restaurant but I told the ladies I don't speak spanish. For some reason they continued to speak to me in spanish. The lady that came by first took our order. Five minutes later another lady came by and asked what we want to order like wtf. Our food comes and the nachos still came with sour cream on it and instead of the al pastor torta they brought a chicken torta. Now I have never tried al pastor before but I thought something was wrong because it looked like chicken. So we didn't make much of it because  we didn't know what it looked like. Then after my wife finished one half of it the other lady comes by with the al pastor torta. That was maybe 5-10 minutes later. So we finished eating and wanted two boxes to put our left overs in and the check. The girl I asked didn't even bring the boxes and she passed by us another 3 times. So I got off my ass and walked up to the counter and asked the lady up at the front for two boxes and the check. The service was poor but we left a tip because the cook made some super bomb food. I will be going back for that. I hope the owner sees this review and coaches his employees to do a better job by the next time I come in."}
{"text":"I've been living close to Eastern and Trop for ... like 8 years already but haven't had a chance to check out this place yet. And ... encouraged by great reviews (and :) ... as I find myself following B.K already) I decide to give Las Pupusas a shot. And it definitely lives up to its name ... I was hungry like a wolf so I ended up ordering 4(!) pupusas - 2 with Chicharron (Pork) and 2 with Loroco y Queso (Cheese). And that was my mistake :) because when girl gave me bag with my food it seemed a little to heavy. They put like a whole pound of spicy cabbage, good 8-9 oz of that liquid stuff you pour on top of it (I just don't know the name of it in Spanish) and 4 good size pupusas. I did ask them to cook pupusas crispy because it does taste better.  So, bottom line: + quality + quantity ! + price ... (although it's probably average for this type of places but still) .. my bill was like $7 - well ... I'm not sure for the rest of the menu ... I will have to try something else but I'll reserve 5 start rating for places that really WOW me. This restaurant is a great value for a casual meal but nothing fancy. So 4 stars - solid GOOD!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant tonight 5/10/14, & had the worst experience of my life . We ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and one bean pupusa. We got the cocktails first and they tasted like pure tap water. It was disgusting! I tried adding lemon and salt to it to cover that horrible flavor & it just didn't work. So I just didn't eat it . My husbands was the exact same . When the pupusa came to the table it was still raw! The masa was not throughly cooked and was super mushy! When we told the lady that it was still raw she gave us a snotty look and said she would try cooking it again, we declined the offer and ordered a chicken tamale instead, It wasn't the best but it was actually eatable.  Don't go here! Horrible food, and a rude staff!"}
{"text":"As soon as I entered I knew I should had taken into the account the reviews talking about the service. Not even a \"hello, sit anywhere\" nothing. Not even a hello. After we ordered the food, the lady never came back to check on us. Not coming back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"Las PUPUSAS de la craig ya no las hacen buenas , y el repollo que hacen tampoco no tiene sabor yo prefiero las PUPUSAS del otro restaurante que está en la Chayenne !!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and although the food is really good they only had 1 waitress for the whole restaurant. We saw a family walk in,  sit down and after not being acknowledged for about 5 minutes they got up and walked out. We never got a bill and had to ask to pay. When we went up to the register we were asked if we wanted to order. What?  Then we had to tell them what we ordered. When I told the girl at the register about the service she said it wasn't on her that she had just got there. Funny thing is she was there the whole time and didn't realized so were we."}
{"text":"My dad took me to Las Pupusas to share the experience of El Salvadoran food with me. He and my Mother do mission work there and love the food. OMG! It was so good. I have told all my friends about it and now planning a trip with my team at work! I can't get enough."}
{"text":"Delicious pupusas.  I had a chicken, beans, and cheese pupusa. Chicken Milanesa was very good. It takes longer than usual for food but its well worth the wait.  Ensalada de fruta drink was good. If you have a pupusa craving in Vegas this will cure it. Flan tastes as it was made from package.  Service after meal could be quicker."}
{"text":"When you walk in you dont know if you set your self or order at the register. Terrible service"}
{"text":"imo, salvadorean vs mexican cuisine is like comparing a Monet to poker playing dogs on velvet. Pupusas have no peer and Las Pupusas does them better than anyone I've found in the valley. The only problems I have with Las Pupusas is they're too cheap, too good and too close to my home, and make me wanna go there too often."}
{"text":"I have given Las Pupusas four stars almost completely based upon how amazing their pupusas are. I buy at least ten at a time to last me maybe a week. :P  I have had less than stellar service at several of their locations but this one wasn't very bad. I would definitely reccommend the chicken, cheese, and bean pupusas, they come with this baggie full of red salsa that is perfectly complimentary and never overpowering. It also comes with a tangy slaw that I could eat by the fistful! Did I mention they are less than two dollars each and the size of my face?!  Go!"}
{"text":"The Las  Pupusa restaurant here In Las Vegas is very easy to locate and very spacious inside.  When we arrived very quite and love the atmosphere.  We traveled from California here on vacation.  We ordered the pork Pupusas  it comes with a mix of coleslaw and hot sauce next time I will have mines without the hot sauce.  It is the most delicious ones I ever tasted and a lot of cheese and big.  I couldn't hardly finish the one I was eating.  The service is great and the prices very reasonable.  I love the menu because it shows you the meal with a number to order how convenient.  They have a lot of delicious plates to choose from.  Come with a empty stomach to enjoy a delicious meal.  Everything is served fresh.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  Will be back again for a big dinner with my husband.  Very clean and nice restaurant to visit and have a delicious meal. Would recommend this place to anyone wanting to eat delicious pupusas freshly made."}
{"text":"Service is okay, the girl was nice. Food is okay ( had 3 different pupusas) The inside decor could use some updating. Overall, its okay here."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this pupuseria, I feel like I have a rock in my stomach for hours afterward. That's because I gorge myself on delicious cheese pouches & you should too.  Hot tips: get the zucchini AND herb (you can combine pupusa fillings). Bring friends who speak Spanish if possible but do not get offended when they ask your friends what \"La Americana\" wants. Just embrace it. Servers might try to talk you out of things they think you can't handle, like El Salvadoran horchata (nuttier and coarser than its Mexican counterpart). Know thyself.   Great place to pick up take out dinner for a group or family."}
{"text":"Perfect Milanesa  Awesome Nachos w fresh made chips as always Great pupusas- bomb ass platanos con crema y frijoles..#14 Dam tamales bomb too! Only complaint 2 flavors Jaritos! Wha about Tamarindo people!"}
{"text":"I gave the north las vegas one a 4 star and gave the Henderson one a 5 star.  Giving this one a 2 because i was hardcore racially profiled by the wait staff. I took a hispanic dude there.  He has never had pupusas.  I taught him how to order, what's good and what not.  Then the damn waitress kept talking to him and asking him questions and ignores me most of the time.  When she does acknowledge my existance, i could tell it's not like she didn't speak English and therefore not comfortable talking to me and asking me questions.  I mean... what does an Asian girl know crap about Hispanic foods right?"}
{"text":"As all other reviewer had stated, it does take a bit of wait.  but the foods were sooo goood"}
{"text":"The place has no AC How can a restaurant in las vegas has NO AC this is ridiculous!!!  Outside is 115 degrees and this people can't afford an AC, think about it twice if you want to come here plus they take forever!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Never had a pupupas before, but would get it again. Service could be a bit better though."}
{"text":"I love pupusas and I'm also super picky but this place is great. The food is on point and it resembles a traditional salvadorean cuisine, affordable and tasty. The pupusas are cheesy, the service is good and the place is clean. I also recommend \"caldo de res\" always super hot and it taste like what mom makes so it's comfort food. Try the empanadas and their \"agua de fruta\"."}
{"text":"The popusas are good but the service is horrible."}
{"text":"This is the first place my boyfriend and I eat at every time we come to Las Vegas. We've eaten here 5 times since April 2010 and have never been even remotely disappointed.  We always get 3 cheese & herb Pupusas and one pork, the combo plate of plantains, crema and refried beans, and my boyfriend usually orders the Seafood Soup, Shrimp Soup or Shrimp Cocktail.  The homemade corn tortillas that come with the soups are too die for!  Everything is wonderful that we've had. I always say I'm going to try something new but I love the Pupusas and Ensalada that comes with them soooo much that I can't go there and not have them!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get freshly made to order pupusas! Far better than the El Salvador Restaurant (or at least better than the buffalo location).  I'm an octo-lavo vegetarian/pescetarian so I always order the zucchini and cheese pupusas and the beans and cheese. If I'm dining in, I get the Sopa 7 Mares: 7 Seas Soup (delicious with plenty of seas food!). The zucchini pupusas are soooo good. Sometimes it's a hit or miss with flavor, but usually it's juicy and seasoned perfectly. Other times the zucchini has no flavor, so I dust my pupusa breading with garlic salt. Either way it's a MUST TRY!! The bean and cheese is fail-proof and always good! I also order their coffee when I dine in, but it's plain. Nothing too special.   The prices are reasonable and the staff are nice. Not overly amazing in service, but I've never had a problem.  Its clean with plenty of seating and parking. I recommend this location if in the area for yummy El Salvadoran food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food but employees take to long to serve you poor customer service. I hope the owner put more attention on this matter."}
{"text":"Personally, what type of business only have one line for take outs ? I called for over an hour and the phone went directly to voice mail. They don't sell you the pupusas by the dozen just like everybody else , so my guess they really think their recipe is that good, but they forget the business side. If you have a lot of restaurants selling them by the dozen at a better price don't understand their business mind. Your choice, but I'm taken my business else where. Food is OK nothing to be impress about."}
{"text":"Visited this location in North Las Vegas because it was close to a relative's house and since I had been wanting to try a pupusa for a while, I decided to give it a try... BIG MISTAKE!!! From the moment I entered, I did not like what I saw. The place was very hot and uncomfortable. There were alot of people eating inside but it was awful noisy (kids running around and parents not caring) I did not know if I was to just sit myself down or wait for assistance...so I picked a table towards the rear of the place and sat down. All the tables looked dirty with grease and finger prints on them. The waitress brought us our menus and then didn't return for about 15 minutes. When she returned, she asked what we wanted. Since the menu had pictures and then you have to hunt for the prices...we were taking a bit to order. The waitress asked if we wanted to take more time to decide (3 TIMES!!!) like she was in a big hurry! We each (3 of us) asked for two pupusas each (mixed) and when the waitress asked for what we wanted to drink, one of us ordered an horchata. The waitress said \"it's Salvadorean style, are you sure you want it?\"instead of telling us how or what it's made with...so we ordered it. Being Latinos, we thought it would be close to anything you would get from a Mexican restaurant...WRONG!!! It tasted very bad! So, 20 minutes later, we got our pupusas which were soaked in grease. I cut one open only to expose a thin layer of beans n cheese with not much else. So basically, it's a thin layer of beans and cheese painted in between two corn tortillas!! or so it seemed. We doused them with hot sauce/salsa (to give them SOME taste) and finished our food. We never saw the waitress come around again so we didn't know if we had to go to the counter to get our check or if it would be brought to us. I went to use the men's restroom to wash up and was bombarded with filth the moment I entered...trash and urine on the floor..grafitti on the walls, light/fan fixtures and even the trash can..YUCK!!! I felt dirtier coming out than when I entered!! So we paid our bill and left...QUICKLY!!! I will NEVER return to this establishment, and based on what others have commented too, the health department really needs to examine this place... I would rate it an \"F\". Trust me, stay away if you are expecting a decent dining experience!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had to try some Pupusas, looked so good on yelp reviews. We had the pork and cheese Pupusas, plantains with beans and sour cream ,sounds weird but actually I liked it. We also had the pork tamales. , Wife had the chile rellano   Pupusas was served with some vinegar marinated cabbage and a watery sauce? The sauce was really bland, don't know what the purpose of the sauce was but they need something better. Pupusas was a little greasy but I don't mind a little grease. First time having pauses so don't now how it supposed to be but I guess they were alright .   Plantains were good dipped in the sour cream and beans, hard to screw up fried plantains unless you burn um these were cooked perfect.   Pork tamales were very good wrapped in banana leaves that added a nice sweetness to them. Very moist.  Wife said chile rellanos were alright. All this food for $20 bucks plus tip , hell yeah this cheap ass will be back.  Lots of seating more cafeteria style, only handful of customers. Service was alright."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. Not good. My wife and I both became sick after eating here."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and fairly priced. I always order an assortment of papusas and the fried platanos. Also, they're ensalada beverage is refreshing and to die for! They also have other appetizing items on their menu that are worth the try.   However, the wait time for the food can be long. If you're in a rush or in a the mood for a quick meal, I would suggest going somewhere else. If not, enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Nothing here is pre-made.  Therefore, it'll take a while for the food to come out.  They're not grilling burgers here, they're making homemade pupusas and it's worth it.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in Vegas and on a budget."}
{"text":"Good, filling delicious little pupusas! I had un de queso (cheese) and un de revuelta (cheese and beans). Topped with cortido (shredded cabbage in a slightly spicy sauce) and a tangy sauce, it's the perfect blend of starch and filling. We ordered tamarindo (a fruit drink) and ensalada (\"salad\" but in this case a juice with finely diced fruit on top). Yum!  The service and atmosphere here is not glamorous but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"They make you wait forever ... Not friendly at all. Waitress come back with wrong dish and when I pointed out she goes back to the kitchen and I can see the cook giving me a dirty look. At that point I knew my food wasn't gonna be good ... Came back with the right dish but tasteless and I could swear it wasn't  even cook all the  way. Horrible salvadorean place . I'll go to the one on smoke ranch and rainbow  from now on they have authentic salvadorean food and they actually have more than one person taking care of customers and they are also very friendly"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab some dinner to go and glad I did! Ordered some pupusas and plantains, the wait wasn't bad at all and definitely worth it since they make it all fresh once you order. These pupusas are the real deal...delicious! Oh yea, and talk about cheap! We will be back."}
{"text":"Come here atleast once a week,  this place is great.   I'm very picky when eating pupusas,  These pupusas rock!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is Salvadoreño first, Mexican second. I ordered two pupusas revueltas -- bean, cheese and chicharron (pork) -- and one with chicken. I liked the revueltas slightly more but both were very good. The texture was excellent -- crispy on the edge. Service was friendly.  The horchata is the Salvadorean type that tastes a bit like black licorice. It's an acquired taste if you're used to Mexican horchata.  On a side note, the nachos my cousin ordered were good too."}
{"text":"A decent place only a few miles east of the Strip, at Tropicana & Eastern.  The restaurant has a double space in a shopping center.  The pupusas are well-made and tasty, just brown on the outside and soft and hot inside.  I like the queso con loroco (cheese and herbs) more than the mixed one.  Not nearly enough heat in the salsa and cabbage slaw.  Both Carne Asada and Carne Desebrada (pulled beef) are average, but have good portions.  Yes, go there for the pupusas.  Beside Salvadorean dishes, the menu also has tacos, burritos, burger with fries.  Service is competent and very friendly.  Servers speak fluent English and Spanish."}
{"text":"I been waiting here for at least 30 minutes ... it's not even packed, I'm a single individual with a small order that I placed 30 mins ago.. I'm starving and I just want my food.. I have never waited this long"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times the food is great! My food has always came out on a timely manner and I had great service and the prices are very  reasonable This a predominately Salvadorean restaurant so if you never had it bring someone with you that's had it before so they can guide you. Other wise pupusas revueltas or mixed pupusas are great pork meat cheese and beans stuffed into a masa (corn dough) that is made to a fat tortilla then grilled. That's what they specialize in. BTW the tortillas that are served with their meals are going to be thicker their supposed to be so be open minded and enjoy, don't expect traditional Mexican or a burger cause this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"The Cheese Pupusas are so delicious and filling and super inexpensive"}
{"text":"I stopped by yesterday afternoon to grab some pupusas and platanos. The pupusas were good. We grabbed 10 total and it was a mix of different ones. The platanos were really good.   Here is why i rated them a 1.  First, the cole slaw had a long hair in it.  It was gross. Luckily, for us the hair was close to the top so we spotted it before anyone ate it.  We obviously threw the slaw away and inspected the rest of our food.  Second, when we got our food the pupusas weren't marked so no one can tell which ones were which.   Overall, I won't be returning to this location but i may still go to another location."}
{"text":"Went here today right before noon party of three,worst service ever or should i say no service.Took 15mins just to come to are table to ask what we wanted to drink and another 10mins to bring them. Ordered and another 30-40 to get food not once did they come back and check if we wanted refills or anything else...Paid and left ..no tip..never again for average food...."}
{"text":"Good food EXCEPT the empanadas platenos con leche!! If you order it and not like it, they don't care & will charge you for it anyway. Service is Horrible!!! Price of food is great! Really inexpensive, which is probably why service sucks! Oh and be warned, if you use your debit card they will charge you .99. It's not much but it's the principle that they won't inform you."}
{"text":"This place has very good pupusas and the price is exceptionally low. The food came out in approximately 15 minutes and the server came by multiple times to check on our table and ensure we didn't need anything else. It is the perfect place for a quick, light, cheap, and tasty dinner."}
{"text":"The best place to eat pupusas! The food was sooo good and the price was very reasonable:)"}
{"text":"I just came here for the pupusas and the empanadas de platano and they were delicious!! Service is kind of slow , but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We waited for our food for 30 min. The girl was rude and we just left. I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at las pupusas and that is the only reason I am giving them a star. They have terrible customer service and need to hire more employees.  I have had 2 many bad experiences at this location, to continue to support them. I would have expected them to hire more employees after they relocated to a much bigger establishment."}
{"text":"The service was quick and the food was pretty good.   I ordered the carne asada quesadilla but it was too greasy for my taste but it was still pretty good.   My brother ordered the pancakes and they were store bought pancakes that you just throw in the microwave and some of it was still frozen.   The one thing that really bothered me was that there was a fly buzzing around me as I ate which kind of ruined my appetite.   Overall it was a mediocre restaurant and I will most likely not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is our second home!   First off don't expect Mexican food. Salvadorians speak spanish but do not cook the same way.   The pupuas are great. It almost like pita bread stuffed with cheese, pork, loroca are a combo of all.   For breakfast you cannot go wrong with casamiento. Eggs, platnos (Almost like fried bananas) with cream, a mix of beans and rice together and tortillas (that are like pita bread, that is Salvi style).   That with a cup of coffee or ensalada (fruit drink) will definitely fill you up.   And if you are looking for a deal, this is it. 2 people and the bill is under $20.00.   If you don't speak Spanish don't worry, they are very nice and understanding when you order."}
{"text":"Great Food, Terrible Service   I had placed my ToGo order at 10am this morning. I ordered 6 papusas. The woman who took my order said 20 mins. So by 1030 am I arrive at the establishment. I walk to the counter. No one greeted me or asked if I needed assistance. At least 3 \"servers\" walked by me. Another customer came up and she was helped right away. After she was helped one of the servers who kept walking by me asked if I needed anything. (This was about a 5 minute span). I told her I ordered ToGo. Gave her my card and apparently she didn't know how to work the machine because it took her another 5 minutes before she called someone else over. After I got back my card, I asked if my food was ready. She said no. I said why not? I called you at 10 and it's almost 1050. You quoted me 20 minutes, why isn't it ready. Then she said we are busy. She didn't even ask me my name of the order. Another server came up to me and asked me my name. And when I told it to her, she said it is ready, here, and shoved me the food. I have worked in the food industry for a long time and they have terrible customer service there. I wouldn't eat here again because of the service I was provided."}
{"text":"This place sucks I call and call to place an order by phone can believe it I call 15 times and always busy and only one line, I don't like to eat there cause the service sucks"}
{"text":"Food has always been excellent. Service is great. We have always welcomed. We have had many questions about the food and they are always willing and able to share information about the menu."}
{"text":"They lost a full star for truly awful service, however, the rest of the experience was good.   I have never had pupusas before, but have been wanting to try them.  I opted for the mixed pupusa, which had beans, cheese and pork.  The filling was seasoned well and came out piping hot.  I enjoyed the coleslaw-like curtido served along side.  Though it didn't have a ton of flavor on its own,  it was a wonderful textural contrast to the filling.  The restaurant was very clean, there was a \"soccer\" game on tv and there were scenic photos on the walls to put me in the mood for some ethnic cuisine. Really the only down side was some rude and extremely slow service.  There were only two tables when we entered, but they both left and for at least some of our meal, we had the place to ourselves.  However, our server was not very friendly or helpful when I explained I didn't know what pupusas were.  Then, our order took at least 15-20 minutes to arrive.  Once we were done, I tried to get our server's attention to ask for the bill, but that also took far longer than I would expect since I could easily see that the restaurant was not busy. The pupusas were only $1.75 each, which were quite the good deal since one was actually fine for a light lunch."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Ordered a pupusa, not sure that it was cooked all the way through. Dined in, it was reason they aren't getting a 4 star. Server was dismissive and it was super hot inside. Not sure if the air was working but it was 110 outside making the inside comparable and not enjoyable."}
{"text":"2nd part of tonite's, \" i'm in a shit mood so let me eat my way home .\" - saw some comments about LAs Pupusa in the past, it's on the way - what the heck.  I get a pork Pupusa and a chicken tamale - $3.50 - seems cheap .  took about 15 minutes to get the food ( i ordered to go ) - the restaurant is large but few customers - let's go !!!  take it home.  It's been about 30-40 minutes before i try both - still very warm / hot - that's a good sign.  The pork pupusa - tasty, could use a little more pork.  i wish i saw BK's review about having it cooked well done because those were the best parts.  The tamale - one bite - ehhh .  too damn greasy for me !  good price, good pupusa  my next stop was across the street - siena italian deli  - closed !!! are you shittin' me !!   next stop - Thanh Huong !!!"}
{"text":"Yum! I was skeptical because the service took a little while. However - worth it! The nachos were delicious. Plantains are my favorite food and these were SOOOOO good!! I'd come back and hope for faster service."}
{"text":"This place in going down the drain. It used to be one of our favorite spots to eat. The service was horrible, it was dirty and the food quality isn't the same."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Waitresses are nice just hard to understand them sometimes. Don't like the fact that they speak Spanish  amongst themselves in front of you. But other than that food is great"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, tried most of the Papusas, all very good. The service was excellent and the ladies there were very sweet. All I would say is that I would like more carries of salsa. But what they did have had great flavor."}
{"text":"Had decent food not the best but decent. The service was horrible slow, not friendly and rude."}
{"text":"The food was great; authentic, giant portions. The Italian in me pushed for the breaded veal, and I was delightfully surprised. The decor is what you'd expect of a 3 star Peruvian joint, but the staff was friendly and I received only got a few quizzical looks from the regulars. I'd suggest it for a quick bite in the area or if you're a futbol fan looking for some decent food and a quick beer from south of the border., but not for much else."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and service. Very low key place. Never had pupusas before so decided to try it. I thought it was more like a flour tortilla. It seems more like a thick corn tortilla which I personally do not care for. We tried the mixed option. They were somewhat tasty but I just did not care for the corn texture. Beans were runny. They were also a bit on the greasy side but that may be how it is supposed to be."}
{"text":"Even though its not Guatemalan this place is close enough to still have that Central American flavor that I miss. The pupusas are good and the platano is delish."}
{"text":"Stood at counter for 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging I was even there. There were only 2 people working counter and waitressing entire restaurant!!! She finally comes to wait on me to tell me it's a 40 minute wait for pupusas. I left immediately. It's 130pm on a Sunday. Wow. Never coming here."}
{"text":"These pupusas are so good. It's my go to restaurant whenever i'm craving them. The pupusas were thick and really satisfying. After two, I was stuffed. Their plantains with cream and beans were a perfect appetizer. It was busy when we got there so it took a little while for our food to come out, but it was worth it. For $2 a piece, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, everything is made fresh so the wait is long. Their only true downfall is their customer service, I hate dealing with them so I only carry out."}
{"text":"Omg their wait time takes forever BUT omg the food and pupusas are so bomb!!! I have to try my best to not devour their bomb meals in under a minute soooo delicious"}
{"text":"I had to get my popusa fix the other day. Settled for this place, it's a clean place lots of specious seating. Popusa were good and big, I was going to order 4 but only got 3 and ended up only eating 2. Service was ok, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've gone here before with my sister, and it's honestly the first place I got to try pupusas. We always like their food, and the staff is always nice, which is why I'm giving them 4 stars.  Based off my recent experience, taking my boyfriend here to try his first pupusas and experience the place, I do have to knock 1 star off.  Going in, they were somewhat busy for lunch, which is fine, but at one point they had about 3 ladies talking around the register, and we still hadn't been greeted or given a menu - was about 10 minutes before a waitress came to welcome us. The other thing that kinda upset my boyfriend was that he had ordered a ground beef taco to go with his bean and cheese pupusa, but he never got it. A different waitress that brought the food initially gave us what looked like a sandwich, so we clarified that he wanted the ground beef taco. Second time around the waitress brought pork tacos. I honestly didn't want to cause grief to the waitress nor waste food, so I just gave the last portion of my pupusas to the boyfriend (which he honestly enjoyed), and I ate the tacos.  Hoping for a better experience next time, especially if I have a craving, and this happens to be the closest location to my boyfriend's place."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong ordering what they're known for, which are their pupusas.   My family and I always order for pick-up though because their service isn't always fast inside. They usually give you time estimates on how fast your food could be picked up, which is nice, but they don't give the full price of what you've just ordered, so keep track of that personally.  Don't get me wrong, everyone is always nice whenever we talk to them, but they're mostly concentrated on getting orders together, etc."}
{"text":"I had my food brain all set to try \"rice balls\" at Oh!  Nigiri! in the same center, but Oh!  Nigiri! was closed for the weekend.  So...wanting something more unusual than Marie Callender's, Las Pupusas was my choice.  I had the tamales con elote and two pupusas:  one queso con loroco and one calabaza.  The tamales (two) come with a large pool each of sour cream and refried beans.  The pupusas come with a shredded cabbage slaw (some kind of clear dressing) on the side.  Everything was okay, if not highly spiced.  Portions were huge, and prices very low.  I couldn't finish anything because just two pupusas and two tortillas was way too much food.  I also had a horchata, and it's different from the Mexican Horchata.  The Salvadoran horchata has a taste like slightly toasted rice and a bit of a coffee flavor, too.  It's not as smooth, as creamy or as sweet as Mexican horchata, but I can't say I like it less.  It's simply different.  The decor reminded me of something you would find at a public swimming pool--no need for black tie here!"}
{"text":"Casi siempre muy buenas pupusas. Hay veces que salen un poco desabridas como no saben a nada si no fuera por el relleno. Siempre muy atentas las meseras."}
{"text":"This place great little hole in the wall. But the food is amazing. They have a shrimp soup and a beef one that r very. Service is slow but worth the Wait."}
{"text":"I wanted something different for lunch, and as I searched, I found Las Pupusas behind Ruby Tuesday's.  The restaurant sign indicated that they served Salvadoran and Mexican dishes.    My wife and I seated ourselves.  Within a minute, the waitress arrive with menus and asked what we wanted to drink.  We both had brewed coffee at $1.50 each, with lots of refills, and lots of creamers.  The menu is interesting, with photo's of the various plates taking up 75% of the menu, and toward the back the menu with prices.  There is a window to the kitchen, and you can see the food prepared fresh.  We sat right there.    I'm a little disappointed in myself, I could have tried a Salvadoran dish, but I played it safe, and ordered Juevos Rancheros for $5.00.  The Juevos Rancheros had two eggs, over medium/hard, with fresh onions, bell pepper, and tomatos.  The plate also had refried beans (south of the border variety, no cheese on top), and sour cream.  Sour cream?  I'm used to getting corn tortilla under the eggs and ingredients, but that didn't happen here.  The food was good, and fair for what was paid.  The wife ordered Carne Asada. The dish came with a huge serving of rice, beans, and a small Mexican style salad (lettuce, radish, tomato slice).  I tasted the Carne Asada, and to be fair, I'm never a fan of meat that is cooked brown all the way through.  The wife liked it.  I thought it tasted okay.  Her rice was so very delicious.  The meal cost $8.00, and it appeared to be a bountiful portion.  Confession time. I didn't know wat a Pupusa was, but from my window view of the kitchen, they looked like they were deliciously prepared.  Next time, I'd try that.  The other customers loaded up on it.  It's probably the signature dish.  One note:  the restaurant charges $.99 to use a credit card or debit card.  It's a mild annoyance, I'll come with cash next time."}
{"text":"Las Pupusas is a good place for the Salvadorian dish named for. These aren't fast food items. If you hate waiting, be content with the fact that you won't be the only one waiting. The plantains with beans and cream are delicious too. If the place is packed, you can drink a typical drink or a beer, and watch soccer. When you order take out, add 15 minutes to the time given. Pupusas are worth the wait!"}
{"text":"What can I say? I decided to give this place a try, though I was not impressed I was at least happy I tried it! We walked in and its a very casual sit yourself kind of place. Waitress brought us our menu and we hot two pupusas one herb and cheese the other pork and cheese. The herb and cheese was on the bland side and needed something to make it pop. We added some salt which helped but did not make it. Same goes for the pork and cheese, although more salty and savory from the pork it wasnstill missing something. Some hot sauce and some of thier tomatoe sauce helped it out. We then had pork deshebrada and the breaded shrimp. The menu was a little confusing as it had some good pics but no description to what they were. Anyway the plates came to the table and I must say that they give large portions and quality does not sacrifice.  Food was good, the shrimp was sweet and the breading was light and crunchy and had  some good flavor the bean were on the salty side but very good. The pork deshebrada was tender and flavorful, although I could have done without the green bell peppers but thats just a personal opinion. The pork deshebrada plate came with some tortillas although they were very thick and seemed undercooked from what I am used to but not bad. The meal also came with a cole slaw type dish that tasted heavily like oregano while not bad it wasn't my taste. Overall I give this place a 3.5 but the ratings do not go into fractions so three it is."}
{"text":"I ordered some food to go and wasn't impressed at all. Inside is kind of chaotic they need to set things up better so customers know where to go if they want to eat inside or get food to go. The lady who took the order was pushy which made so sense they weren't busy and it's just rude. I ended up getting a burrito with cheese and sour cream to go. the tortilla tasted funky and the meat was not only flavorless but it was so fatty. The burrito looked good in size when I first opened it and then after I started eating it there was an obscene amount of sour cream inside. I mean way more sour cream than the meat. I also noticed there wasn't much cheese but in one spot. I had a bean and cheese pupusas and if this is the way they are supposed to be then why so people like them? I figured there would be more filling but maybe that's how these are made. The fried banana things were the only thing that tasted good."}
{"text":"I loved the food here, even though I wasn't sure what a lot of it was called. The pupusas were great. I also had a little item that was the closest to a fresh tamale I've gotten in Vegas. It was not called a tamale, but it would be worth your time to ask the server and order one! The prices also rocked."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. We thought we were walking into a Fine dining El Salvadorian Restaurant. It was just another Taco shop with a fancy front serving terrible food. The interior looked-like a warehouse lipsticked with chandeliers. There was no one to greet you at the entrance, so you're not sure if you seat yourself or not. There we no booths just uncomfortable chairs. I ordered the beef stew. The meat was tender but, not much flavor and the portions are on the small side. I had a lot more rice then beans and salad. We also ordered the \"Onion Steak\" which we were told by the waitress it was minced steak fried with onions. Instead, we were served the driest flank steak in history. Our salt shaker was dirty and they don't provide pepper. The service was poor. The waitress was nice but, struggled due to her language barrier. She did not check on us after our food was served. We asked for refills and our bill a few times. (Note, they charge for refills so beware.) Not worth the price, time or effort.  Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Nice little neighborhood place that is sure to satisfy your pupusa cravings. My husband and I decided to have a laid back Friday night and opted for Las Pupusas for dinner.  Thankfully I did not experience any of the horrific service mentioned by others. Our waitress was polite and patient with us. The only gripe is that I had to ask for a water refill. We sampled several of their dishes and some stood out more than others.  Nachos: pretty standard with fresh chips and plentiful toppings. We requested them without onion on top and the request was fulfilled without a problem. Caramelized Plantains: I realllllly enjoyed these. It was a generous portion of the subtly sweet plantains that were cooked perfectly. They came with a side of sour cream which balanced the flavor of savory and sweet perfectly. Beef Tongue Plate: A generous portion of perfectly cooked, juicy yet tender beef tongue, accompanied by rice, beans, and greens. This was probably my favorite of the items we ordered. PUPUSAS: And of course, we made our way to their pupusas opting to try several flavors consisting of cheese, herbs and cheese, pork and cheese, and beans. The cheese was overwhelming and dominating all of the flavors, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The pupusas were some of the better I have had here in Vegas, and fairly priced at $1.95 a pop.  This was a generous quality dinner that left us stuffed without breaking the bank. We will be returning to sample more of their offerings, more specifically their tortas."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for ooey gooey cheesy and meaty.  Go Las Pupusas.  Woot!  Here's what went down in the tummy: 1.  Empanadas - kinda sweet... maybe had to be in the mood for it, but for a hot summer day in vegas... that's no go 2.  Enchiladas con pollo - swish! 3.  Las Cumientes - fried platanos, frijoles, scrambled eggs and massive spoonful of sourcream!   4.  Dos Pupusas Revueltos (mixed) - frijoles, chicharone, and queso mix.  picture a quesadilla but all the edges are sealed and it's like a pocket of ooey gooey, cheesy goodness.  cut into it and the mixture oozed out.  chew it with the fresh corn/flour outer layer.  *eyes rolllingggg.  Do try with the salad mixture and sauce provided."}
{"text":"Service was aweful, food took forever to come out felt like they were importing from El salvador. Took FOREVER to receive refills and drinks, pupusa were mediocre and burrito meat was dry. Half of my cousins burger was burnt and the tamales were eh at best. Waitress we so \"admirable\" and \"nice\" I would not come here again. I would give negative stars if possible"}
{"text":"The Pupusas and entrees are really tasty, the prices they charge are very reasonable. But like their previous location, the front /dining area is a BIG mess.  It was trashed both times I visited here. None of the tables were bussed.  Food debris under tables. One even had broken glass! So  pick-up orders will have to do.  Such a shame though brand new building, would be a more pleasant experience if the dining area was clean and you don't have to look at all the dirty tables."}
{"text":"3 stars because nobody spoke English. Cashier tried but still messed my order up. Foods ok, might have had a better experience had there not been such a big language barrier."}
{"text":"Ummm...one word.  Yuck.   I love food. A lot.  I love any sort of hispanic food.  This was just plain gross.  We ordered 4 different kind of pupusas thinking that this is the name if the place they have to be good.   We had chicken, mix, cheese, bean and cheese and pork. The cheese was barely edible the rest were not for human consumption.  Greasy, flavorless mush inside and greasy, flavorless breading outside.  Notice I used greasy twice...yep.   There was a kid literally running around the place moving tables chairs and bumping into our table.  We initially thought we would dine in and then immediately changed our mind after the kid decided to make camp by our table staring at us while pretend playing an annoying arcade game they have in there. Not my cup of tea. :("}
{"text":"Pésimo lugar para una orden de 10 pupusas tardan mas de una hora. No contestan el teléfono y llega gente esperando su orden y lo único q le dicen sabe q aquí no tengo su orden a lo mejor la hizo en otro restauran"}
{"text":"Came for pupusas a couple of times. The revueltas are my pick and they're okay, but not the best. Some days they're thick with filling, other days they're not, but they're always super greasy, even compared to other pupusa places. The service I've received hasn't been as bad as others have mentioned. Prices are fairly low, but there is a $1 card charge, which I find a bit steep."}
{"text":"Originally planned on going to Capriotti's, but smelled something tastier from the parking lot. Wife is a picky eater and absolutely loved everything. We had the nachos with carne asada, al pastor burrito, chicharron papusa, and the bean and cheese papusa. We ate well there and had leftovers. And it wasn't that harsh on the wallet. We will definitely be back and be bringing friends and family"}
{"text":"Solid choice for Pupusas at a very reasonable price. For $1.95 you can enjoy a a hot and fresh pupusa filled with your choice of fillings (my vote: Revueltas). My dining experiences here are limited to take out orders but I find that their food quality and taste is consistent."}
{"text":"I thought this place was good but after seeing they charged a tip and I did not tip on my receipt because they did not give me a receipt to add a tip so they decided to add one on their own and I called this morning and they said to call the manager because they don't know what I was talking about and hung up. So now I'm never coming back here and please beware smh."}
{"text":"Ok this is an authentic experience with authentic El Salvadoran Horchatabig restaurant very clean service is good I go with a fluent Spanish speaking sister which makes ordering easy. Menus have some pictures to help if you are not familiar with the food. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Omg best pupusas ever it's hard to find a good Salvadoran food place this one beats it by a lot also the salpicón is the best dish so good and delicious definitely coming back again when I'm back in Vegas"}
{"text":"Pupusas are yummy and reasonably priced! I always order over the phone and pick up and always seem to still have to wait."}
{"text":"Really good food. Nice people and great service. Price is also nice as well. Clean and we'll lit. Music is way better then other mexican restaurants. A new favorite place."}
{"text":"Until today this was my favorite place to eat pupusas in Vegas. Went with a friend, we shared the breakfast platter with chorizo and eggs and two pupusas revueltas but in less than 10 minutes I got so sick I could barely walked to the bathroom and now I have food borne ( diarrhea, vomiting, nauseas, headache, dizziness) and now my friend too.  I spoke to the manager Maria, le dejé saber que no estaba tratando de comer gratis pero que tuvieran cuidado que algo no estaba bien ya sea con el chorizos, chicharron o queso y su respuesta fue que los ingredientes han estado el el refrigerador, yo entiendo pero no cuando están cocinando las pupusas, tienes todos afuera por horas sin un contenedor con hielo para mantenerlos frescos. The only think I know I'm calling the Healt Department and the FDA, they have to be more serious about the food, they can kill a person.  Definitely not going to this place again and telling everybody around me to avoid it and save the diarrhea.  Disgusting ( why I have to give one star when I have to go the ER"}
{"text":"I've only had pupusas twice, ever. First time was in California, and it was awesome. This time around at Las Pupusas, not so much.  I got a really weird craving for a really good pupusa, so I took to the Yelp community that led me here on my lunch break. This place is like a hole in the wall joint, except it is a big hole in the wall, with I believe two locations in town. It's in a seedy shopping center in a seedy area of town. And inside, I too realized it smelled like a \"dirty bucket\". Anyway, I waited patiently for my pork n cheese pupusa, along with a plain cheese pupusa. I thought why not mix it up in case I found that one or the other didnt satisfy. Well... They both equally did not. I was expecting these things, at least the one with pork, to be bursting with flavor- sadly, not so. I was quite disappointed. The cabbage slaw was very much needed along with a lot of Tapatio. The upside is that they aren't horrible, and at 1.95 each, they're quite large n stuffed, But then again, do size n stuffing really matter if the stuffing just ain't that dazzling? Also tried the nachos... Again, lacking in flavor- skip it, Not sure that I would come back here to fulfill my pupusa craving. These pupusas are just not as flavorful as one would hope."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of pupusas, I first got introduced to this restaurant at the eastern location, I have been going for about 10 years but it's a far drive from where I live so when they opened this one in the Northwest I was excited, the food is just as good but the service isn't so great! We didn't get the water we ordered, we had to remind the waitress and we got totally ignored when we wanted the bill, went up to the register to pay and was ignored again, food took a long time, waitress only checked up on use once, so overall great food and terrible service! Otherwise I'd give the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Service was fine when I went today at 1pm. There were only two other tables seated, which was kind of weird.  I ordered the Big Pastor Burrito with no rice and asked if they could make it spicy. The server asked if I wanted them to put the hot sauce in the burrito instead of on the side... I asked if they had any habaneros, jalapenos, or other spicy peppers they could put in the burrito and she said \"jalapenos\". Ok.  The burrito arrived and it is not big. For 6 bucks, I didn't expect it to be big, but they may want to change the menu to reflect the actual size of the burrito.   The pastor was cooked on a flat top with grease, which made the burrito greasy and killed the flavor. The beans overpowered the meat, but were ok. I could have done without the pickled jalapenos as it made the burrito very salty. I assumed they would have fresh jalapenos so it's my fault for not asking.  The hot sauce tasted like they reconstituted dried peppers and then blended it up.  Not good.  I didn't try the papusas and to be honest, will probably never come back to try them."}
{"text":"I had a chicken and cheese pupusas that was very good, but everything else I ordered was pretty gross. I ordered carne asada tacos, Tamales, chicken and steak quesadillas. The tamales were mushy and everything was so greasy I couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"Just recently moved down from California and I was craving some pupusas. This restaurant is literally around the block from my house so I decided to give a try and decided to dine-in despite of the bad reviews people have posted on how slow service and how the waitresses don't come to check up on you. First let me tell you that I only waited for 15 minutes for my pupusas and platanos, there were three in my party and for me that was super quick. I come from California, this to me was speedy service compared to what you'd wait in LA to get your meal is roughly 20-45 minutes. So I give the ladies 5 stars for bringing our food fairly quickly and for checking up on us multiple times. Now the pupusas are large! We got the revueltas, queso con loroco, and queso con frijoles...they were quiet good, my favorite one was the queso con loroco, it's delicious!  the platanos Fritos con crema to die for. I've had better pupusas back in LA but this we're good enough to fill my craving. A must try if you're a local. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I had the number 31 here which is carne GUIsada not asada, as I stupidly kept thinking was what the server was saying.  The difference being that guisada is braised beef and asada is grilled.  My confusion started with looking up Mexican places open at 9:00 pm on yelp and this place came up.  Not knowing what a pupusa is didn't help either, as it is actually a Salvadorean staple dish apparently.  Nevertheless, I was hungry and always down to try something new.   To drink, I had the kolashampas, which tastes like bubble gum soda. Not too shabby.  My only complaint here is that I ordered chicken quesadillas as appetizers, but they ended up coming out with the carne guisada. They were delicious anyhow, as was the carne guisada which has a mildly spicy tomatoish sauce strewn over it.  Makes for great dipping with the pupusa bread.  The servers were polite and helpful, although they probably couldn't help themselves from smiling at the book in my hand (grad school). The prices were not too bad at all either, think I ended up paying like $17 for all three things."}
{"text":"Pupusas are tasty and filling. The plantain plate with beans and sour cream is my favorite. The service is what kills it for me. We sit down, and it's a good 15 minutes before we are acknowledged. At that point we are ready to order so we tell the lady, im assuming owner because she is dressed in nice clothes, what we want to eat and drink. We order 4 mixed Pupusas, nachos, rice and beans, and the plantain plate with 2 waters.   The nachos come out first and they are ok. Ground beef, tomatoes, beans and sour cream top them. The nacho chips are homemade so they are warm and have a nice crunch to them. Pupusas come out shortly after. They are hot and delicious and are served with all the accompaniments. In the meantime we need refills and no one is to be found. So we have to walk up to the counter and ask for them. They finally bring out the plantains and I don't mind because they are sweet so it's kind of like dessert. They are cooked perfectly. So we are just about finished and the owner comes to our table with the rice and beans and says sorry they just made them right now. We tell her no thanks we are just about done with our meal. She seemed irritated but it's not my fault they forgot about it until last minute. I probably won't be dining in again, but since I like the food, I may try pickup."}
{"text":"So their new location is a lot better than the old one BUT it smells like sewer.  The smell is so strong.   It's disgusting.  It ruins this restaurant.  The P-trap needs to get checked.. the smell makes you nauseous."}
{"text":"Do not go here worst service ever made me wait 30 to 40 minutes for the food and it wasn't even that good don't recommend this place to nobody"}
{"text":"I had heard so many great things about this place that I finally got to go and try it yesterday. I'm Cuban and I knew that they had yucca, friend pork, fried plantains in addition to all kinds of other dishes that seemed to be a lot like Cuban food. The food was delicious and the staff was really friendly. We ordered 2 puposas, the yucca and plantains and it fed two of us with leftovers and it was only $15.  I can't wait to take my mom there. Great food!!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the nicer pupuserias in Vegas. Haven't been to all locations and I understand there are not the same. This on be had polite and attentive staff (unless it's busy and you don't speak Spanish, in which case forget about it) and food is fair to fine. Rather greasy and pupusas are on the thick side, but less doughy than other places. They mainly have cheese in them and not really much vegetables (loroco, zucchini etc.). Vibe is OK but to generic and not that welcoming. Ok for a lunch or a quick oily bite."}
{"text":"This place is not far from the house at all so I decided to give it a try.   Off the bat, You should order your food or be prepared to wait. Fresh pupusas are always well worth the wait though. Don't touch the bottom of your bag because they will be burning hot!  I got the cheese, bean and cheese, cheese and herb, chicken and cheese and cheese and zucchini. All very good. The Curtido I felt like could be a little big more flavorful but for 1.95 a pupusa, its pretty good."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, just always forget to write a review. I finally have the time to do so, so.....here goes..  Came here for brunch, and we're always greeted nicely upon walking in. Always order the salvadorian horchata and the meat and cheese pupusas. Their pupusas are huge!!!! I love pupusas, and this restaurant honestly has one of the biggest pupusas portions. I also ordered the casamiento dish, which is a breakfast dish that comes with scrambled eggs, beans and rice, sour cream (a must!) and platanos (fried bananas). This breakfast dish is Sooo good, I don't even know how to explain it in words. You must try it!  After eating, they're always so gracious with to-go. They always add a new sauce and cortido (salad that goes with the pupusas) along with your pupusas.   Definitely coming back here! Take out is also convenient!"}
{"text":"They have a new location, right across from the old location, the mixed Pupusas tastes great, prices are pretty good too, only complaint is the servers, they seem uninterested in your needs after your meal is delivered, which makes it an effort to get things like a refill"}
{"text":"My friend who is from El Salvador introduced me to pupusas and I have been trying to get my fix since then and I found it here. The wait is about 25 mins for an order of pupusas but is worth every minute !! If your in a rush call ahead and place a order. Service was friendly and over all great we will diffidently come again !!"}
{"text":"I have tried pupusas in California and the ones at this place were really disappointing and I get the feeling that people who rated the food here as good have just not had really good pupusas. I will never go back."}
{"text":"OMG, the casamientos (breakfast plate) and the pupusas are soooo yummy AND cheap!!  My favorite combination, LOL.  I've tried the different burritos but they are too different from what I am used to (i.e. Mexican style) but the breakfast plates and the pupusas make up for it.  We take our daughter to the Gymboree right next door and always get something to go from here =)"}
{"text":"I had no idea what a Pupusa was.  Boy am I glad I found out.  These not so little masa pockets of deliciousness are to die for.  Oh... and soooooooooo inexpensive.  My favorite is stuffed with pork and beans.  Now please keep in mind I am not talking about Oscar Meyer and Baked Beans.  Think Spanish/South American spiced pulled pork with those delicious re-fried beans.  NOW you have the idea.  I can almost eat two of these treats, but I ordered three because I thought anything that cheap couldn't be big.  Learn from me!!!!  :)  Also, much to my delight, they have Jarrito's soda pop.  A favorite Mexican treat for me.  I recommend the Mandarin.  So why only 3 stars?  Well the \"service\" is friendly but far from \"attentive\"  Also, if you do not speak any Spanish you WILL struggle in placing your order.  I recommend using your finger and the menu if you get stuck.  Getting your food takes some time so dont be in a rush.  I would easily expect to wait 30 minutes between ordering and eating.    The experience is very inexpensive.  One Pupusa, one Jarrito's and tip will get you full and out the door for 5 bucks.  The grill is visible to the dining room so if you are curious, like me, you can watch these delightful treats being made.  Overall, i recommend giving them a try.  It's a nice change and a fun experience."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was terrible.  Take it to go if you don't want to have a bad experience like I did."}
{"text":"Be aware of this place they over charge for the smallest things and throw in extra charges for stuff you never ordered. CHECK YOUR RECEIPT CAREFULLY!!! Food is great but you cant trust their servers."}
{"text":"It's close to UNLV and I prefer getting my cheese pupusas over anything at the Student Union. The only thing is that I'd have to give up my parking space at school if I wanna come here for lunch. Staff is super friendly, food takes a while to come out but it's ok with me, and I always leave here satisfied and full."}
{"text":"This place is good. Im Salvy so im a big crtic of pupusas and this place does them well. We get plenty of cortido to go with our pupusas so thats good. The salvy horchata is perfect. I think the price is fair, and the customer service is coo. The dine in kind of smells, Maybe a sewer problem idk.. I recommend it but there are spots a bit better"}
{"text":"I come from eating the real thing in El Salvador, and their pupusas are pretty good.  The revuelta pupusas were better than the quezos, though the curtido (pickled cabbage) needs a little work.  I would go again to get my dose of El Salvador again."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant says it all. Their signature item (pupusa) is the best this place has to offer. Their standard pupusa comes with your choice of meat, beans, cheese, and herbs. However, you can also custom fill your pupusa and change it up a bit. For example, my wife orders hers with no beans. If you don't try their pupusas, you will be thoroughly disappointed because the rest of the food here is not good.  For our late breakfast, I had the chorizo and eggs. The portion size was small, and the amount of chorizo in this dish was almost non-existent. Therefore, it was like eating scrambled eggs with chorizo flavored grease.  The dish also came with a side of beans which were runny- but tasted OK.  I used the plain pupusa as a chip and dipped them into my beans. My wife ordered the carne asada taco and was disappointed. The meat tasted funny, and the taco itself was not garnished with onions/cilantro, or salsa.  My three year old son had their plain cheese quesadilla and seemed to really like it.   I don't think my wife and I will come back here anytime soon. As we were waiting for our food, we noticed the cooks in the back using their bare hands to touch all the food, dirty containers, and uncooked dough. Never once did we notice them wash their hands in the process. If you are going to have an open kitchen for everyone to see, you better run a clean operation.   My wife is convinced the health department will shut this place down sooner or later. But in the meantime, give me two of them pupusas to go!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Salvadorian Fair!  I'm so happy to see this in my neighborhood! My husband is from El Salvador and craves foods from his homeland.  When we tried this place out, we had several bean and cheese pupusas, horchata (salvadorian of course) corn tamales and black beans. The corn tamales where a little dry, but still very good. The pupusas were the best!"}
{"text":"I wish there were no stars. I honestly never wrote a bad review ... and don't plan on Ever doing it again. But I have to today. Today I went to this \"establishment\" at 8:55PM on a Monday. On yelp and ON THE DOORS it says it closes at 9:30pm. I tried to open the door but doors were locked. They are GLASS WINDOWS, The worker looked at straight at me and then just turned away and ignored me. . No sorry, no oh we closed early; NOTHING.    NEVER COMING BACK  !"}
{"text":"The sad thing is these pupusas are actually good but having so many better options in Vegas I will definitely not be back! Where do I start, they take a really really long time to make your food, the food is on the pricey side so not having a children's menu sucks because I had to order my children adult size portion burritos they were huge, and they were so greasy I just couldn't take the leftovers home after only 3 bites that she took. Now for the worst part, we were sitting eating our food and my son jumps up after seeing a cockroach running towards our table oh so gross! The floor was so dirty it's no wonder they have roaches."}
{"text":"They're really big pupusas and they come stuffed so that's real good! There is a long wait time but it's all because they're freshly made, so be ready to wait, the employees are real hard workers and they are in the back the entire time. Never got a refill:( but real good pupusas and big, ordered two bean pupusas, my hubby ordered revueltas which were sooooo much better! I could only finish one!"}
{"text":"Four stars overall,  are you kidding me!!!! Ensalada drink was mediocre at best! Service is slow and the pupusas de chicharon suck. The only good plates we had was the breakfast with casamiento and bistec. When they eventually came to check on us,  the servers were nice. After we finished eating it took over 10 minutes for someone to check on us and they had three servers on the floor with seven tables with customers. They finally brought us the to go boxes but never returned to deliver the check.  We had to go stand at the register until someone came out from the back and charge us."}
{"text":"Worst service.  Got there around 2:45 did not get a drink served until 3:20 no menus,  nothing. service is awful.  Six girls working and only two other tables full.  Walked out extremely upset.  Best in las Vegas?  Please.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I like that you can see into the kitchen and the food is very fresh. Its a great place to go for a good lunch on a budget. Only thing i did not enjoy was the horchata, different taste than i am used to. But overall its great food, i will be back"}
{"text":"The food here is definitely fresh. I think that is the most important thing for the diner to consider.  We had the fried zucchini appetizer. The sauce that came with it tasted like tomato paste. The calamari is much better.   The pork tamale is amazing! I never eat here without having one.   I had a quesadilla. Not sure what cheese they used but it had a bit of a sharpness to it. It was a bit greasy too.   If you eat here have something with meat. It is definitely their strength."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious! Customer service was great too! I had a cheese papusa and carne asada nachos. Both were yummy! They have this red sauce that can go on anything and give the food even more flavor. It has a hint of spicyness. Will def come back and try some more Salvadorian dishes!"}
{"text":"Las Pupusas is pretty good stuff!  I don't eat a lot of Latin food because it tends to be heavy for me, but this place is little bit lighter than your average Tex Mex restaurant.  I had a bite of three different types of Pupusas, and at a $1.75 these are a must.  They were all good, but I particularly liked the cheese one with a little bit of hot sauce on it.  I ordered the fish fillet from the menu.  It was around $8.95 or so.  The fish was good quality and tasty.  It had a light breading on it that wasn't too heavy or greasy, and had just the right amount of flavor without being too salty.  The beans were good, but I was really into the rice.  The rice was just a plain white rice instead of the yellow tomato rice that you normally get at a Tex Mex place.  Again, much lighter and less salty.    The food is just a step up in healthiness and quality in my book.  The service was top notch.  The waitress constantly refilled our drinks, and made sure everything tasted good.  Although I am still not a huge Latin food lover, I have to give this spot a 4 star review!  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but I can see this being a usual for work lunch."}
{"text":"First time here and first time trying pupusas. Overall a good dining experience. Pupusas we're cheap and good, yucca was nice as well. I would definitely come back, just maybe for take out as it seems they don't turn their AC on and it was a warm day out."}
{"text":"The food here is good but the cuatomer service is horrible ive been there several times with my friend and not once have i gotten good customer service. The food is great but the people who work there are so rude. My friend has a baby so we ask for a high chair and the waiter there gave us atitude and said we dont have any right now. Then we asked her for salsa and ahe never brought it to us. Lastly ww had to go to the cashier and ask for watwr because she never came back to pur table to asl if we needed anything after she gave us our food. Horrible service since then ww haven't gone back to eat there."}
{"text":"I like this place. The pupusas are absolutely awesome!!! they are all I eat there but my wife loves their tamales. Service is pretty good and an extremely good price. This is literally the lowest cost meal I ever get too. It is less expensive than eating at McDonalds for me and about 1000X better. We have taken many people there and all of them love it and go themselves too."}
{"text":"PRO: ~Satisfies the craving ~Good (nothing spectacular)  CONS: ~Horrible service   I order to go. I'm picky w pupusas bc I've grown up w my abuelita making them. They're good but nothing special. The employees are extremely ditsy & slow. Often argue about who should take the order. I wouldn't recommend sitting in. They're awful at attending the table. (Taking them home is better) Overall okay if you're willing to put up with the employees."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill we ordered pupusas de chicharron con queso & all they gave us was dry barely any chicharron & no queso at all you can clearly see in the picture the little they put it was just basically a huge thick dry tortilla extremely disappointed getting home to find out they forgot to put the queso, so it made it all dry barely eatable not even my dog would eat it. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Pupusas could use a bit more time on the grill, lack of non-Americanized options like Chicken (just the normal pork and cheese varieties); still awesome over-all.  The refried beans are /AMAZING/.  Plenty of seating, fast service, bone up on your spanish, etc etc."}
{"text":"I had never tried pupusas before, but had seen and heard about them from friends. This place is clean, welcoming to non-spanish speaking customers, and really great overall in food and service. I love the pupusas with everything inside (beans, cheese and herbs, pork), but they also have a chicken pupusa that is also mighty tasty for those who may not consume pork.   The tamales--oh the tamales! I think these may very well be my most favorite tamales I have ever eaten! I know that homemade will always win, but I like these tamales better than the ones at Dona Maria's and at other places I've traveled to. I like the pork ones but the chicken tamales are pretty badass too.  They stay super moist and explode with flavor.   Also, the empanadas de platanos are really good too. I've never had sweet empanadas like that and I love the way they do plantains with the beans and sour cream. I have yet to try the other empanadas and the pasteles but according to some of the other reviews they seem like a sure bet as well. If only I could pry myself aways from the pupusas and tamales!"}
{"text":"This place level of customer service is a joke. New home same bad service. It's a shame because the food is good but the service No Bueno. Plus they need some help and training from the health district because the cashier is getting money and touching plates without washing her hands. They also need more waiters. Service at the new location was very slow and rude."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but don't expect good service you will sit there for Atleast 15 mins for ur drink and make sure u ready to order or you can add another 15... You food will take about another 30-45 mins they have one lady making pupusas seriously under staffed maybe like 2 waitresses only to. But we continue to come because haven't had better pupusas"}
{"text":"Embarrassing. No chicken? We got here at 5:15, and the waitress told us that they had run out of chicken.   Service was OK, and the food provided in replacement for our Chicken Pupusas was decent. I would avoid this place if possible; multiple other superior pupusas joints exist in town. I would highly recommend SalvaMex."}
{"text":"Pupusas are the best .. The atmosphere is great as well. Very clean very open great food one more thing."}
{"text":"The restaurant it's clean, the food is good not great, service is OK the reason of my two stars is because they add and extra dollar on my final bill, I was checking my statement and it's stupid but they charged me 0.99 cents from extra from what I supposedly signed for, which is really stupid but it makes me wonder if they do it on every guest."}
{"text":"Prices are good.  My favorite pups as in Vegas.  Their beans are great!"}
{"text":"Great Pupusas... They gave us a menu so that we can call our order in next time.  I wonder if my wife packed it before we went back home to Hawaii, where there are no pupusas."}
{"text":"Service.was.horrible, only one lady to take orders, phone orders and she is the cashier. Popusas was.ok but i ask for a srimp cocktail and my son for a asada torta, those were the worst ever. I wonder if they only have one cook"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost.  I came based on the reviews but cleary not written but actual customers.  Place was empty on a Friday night and that's never a good sign.  Ordered the carnitas burrito and it was bland, the meat over cooked and the rice was bad. Yuck!  That's what I thought.  Rest of the party ordered shrimp fajitas and carne asada plate and neither faired any better.  The pita bread that was supposed to be a tortillas I couldn't even eat it.    No chips and salsa to start with and the place was a little dirty.  Prices were about the only thing positive to write about.  If you want authentic Mexican food this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Service...... I don't think there is any. Not very busy place and but yet it takes forever for anything."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday afternoon lunch looking for some good Honduran and Salvadorean food.  Was not disappointed.  Service was friendly snd casual.  Dining room area was clean, had a simple 'cafeteria' style quality to it (although the restaurant has waiter service or counter service for take-out).  Tried some of the staples - curtido, pupusas, tamales, salpicon, carne milanesa - my dining guests were big fans of the carne milanesa, but the salpicon and its vinegar-sourness was the star for me, and the pupusas were solid.  Beans and rice were excellent as well - beans were creamy and smooth - more like NOLA red beans type sauce (although mild flavored) and rice was well cooked.  All-in-all a great neighborhood place for some interesting and tasty dining."}
{"text":"I have now been here 3x this week and always get the same thing. The $2 papusas!!! Theyre great tasting and you only need 2 till fill you up. Definitely will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Tried this place for work birthday lunch and have too say it was very good. The food was on point and the prices were very reasonable. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"MMM MMMM MMM, SO FREAKIN' BOMBTASTIC!!  This is my favorite pupusa place. They make your pupusas the second you order them so they're as fresh as can be. I love the mixed pork, bean, and cheese ones, they're my absolute favorite!   I've come here about 3 times already. The last time i came I got 4 pupusas which came with the ensalada and tomato sauce for about 7 bucks, so cheap!  I have no complaints about this place, my mouth is starting to drool just thinking about their pupusas, mmmm!"}
{"text":"It's good enough for what it is - a strip mall Salvadorean restaurant.  I stumbled in around 8:00 one evening.  The place is huge, and was mostly empty.  I'm assuming that there is a reason there are so many tables, maybe there is a wild lunch rush.  For a quick, cheap, and filling meal, this would fit the bill.  We kept our menu simple.  A pile of papusas (all bean and cheese), some plantains (yum), a steak and rice burrito, some horchata and a pineapple drink that another reader recommended.  The papusas were decent enough, greasy and warm, the fit the bill.  I'm a big fan of the simple vinagary-tomatoey sauce that comes with them (Frank's Red Hot is one of my top 10 food products, so my preferences trend toward vinagar and spice).  The rice in the burrito was a bit weird - at first I thought it was potatoes, it was mushy in a weird way.  But, it all had the seasoning of the beef, so it was salty and satisfying.  The plantains were rather greasy, but still, who can resist sweet fried plantains?  Middle of the road in terms of quality and taste, but it's about as cheap as it comes, so it gets bonus points for that.  It sure beats Taco Hell for Latin themed food any day of the week!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, the atole de elote was cold, service is not great, but I will go back because I like Salvadorian food & it's the closest one to my home."}
{"text":"I love pupusas but make sure to order our pupusas at from because they might take a while, but so delicious."}
{"text":"Supreme Nachos and Chicken, Bean and Cheese Pupusas! Yummy! Surprised this time because sometimes it's a hit or miss, but this time we dined in and it was great! Service was good, glad they were able to split checks with a large group! I didn't have it but the Horchata I heard was tasty!"}
{"text":"The best El Salvadorian restaurant in Las Vegas everything is cooked fresh and to order, they recently got a bigger place but I'm not too fond of and thats the  only reason why they got 4 stars the smaller location was more personal but overall food is excellent."}
{"text":"if you're looking for good salvadorian popusas this place here is worth to check out, I believe there is more than one location in town, I've only been to the one in north Las Vegas and I keep coming back, very reasonable prices and I can eat a lot , but just two will fill me up, the popusas have a good balance of stuffing and masa, they have other options like tacos, tortas, burgers, breakfast and very kid friendly food like chicken fingers. I've been here many times and have never experienced a problem with service or the quality of their food, check this place out if you're in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"I've been twice since they moved locations. My coworkers and I place our order over the phone for pick up. We're able to separate our orders (great when it's multiple of us ordering). We usually call maybe a hour ahead and just let the ladies know what time we'll be picking up. Food is ready for pick up once we get there. Food is still hot by the time we get back to the office. Their Pupusas are simply delicious! I even order extra for my girlfriend so she as dinner.  Price is not bad either!"}
{"text":"Good food that fills you up quickly, like their prices too."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese pupusas!  Literally, any of the pupusas that contain cheese are excellent.  The tacos were also very good (carnitas and sabor), although a little heavy on the lettuce.  The service was very good and our waitress was very sweet.  One warning is that the pupusas are BIG.  I ordered two plus a taco and ate it all because it was so tasty, but was super stuffed afterward.  Definitely will head back when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Ive had good experience here in the past, but after last time, I am never coming back. I ordered a basic breakfast, ham and eggs with 2 horchatas late one morning and the place was practically empty. I got my drinks but my breakfast never came. As people came in after me, I could not help but notice they would get their food while I sat and waited. After a third table got their food, I asked my waitress where my order was and she said she forgot to put it in. Well ok, so I expected to get my order right away. Table after table came and they were served while I was not. Again I reminded my waitress and she apologized and said it will be ready in 5 minutes. After 10 minutes, I asked again and she said it would be right out, and then nothing. After almost a full hour I told my waitress to give me the check for the drinks as I had to leave. She had the nerve to appear annoyed at my request. At this point I was starving and didn't care and couldn't believe I waited as long as I did. I signed my ATM receipt and did not leave a tip on the $4 charge. Low and behold, I noticed my bank statement that month and someone at the restaurant added a dollar under the tip category. I called the bank and they credited my account but this is still fraud and illegal. I have no idea why I was not given my order as I was polite until the very end, even then I could have demanded to speak to the manager but didn't bother as I have no intention of ever going back. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Very nice vibe and the staff was nice too. Pupusas came in nice and hot, but were a little too expensive for me. Drinks are expensive to order, however. The wait time was not too long."}
{"text":"Once again they disappointed with their horrible service, walked in sat ourselves, 15 mins if not more passed without being acknowledged my husband got up and left, i walked up and asked for a manager & told her of all our bad experiences and wanting to give the place the benefit of a doubt was were extremely disappointed, she tried to excuse her staff by saying how busy they were but I said I understood yet was not a reason to not even acknowledge us, a simple \"I'll b with you\" \"give me a moment\" any sort of acknowledgement wild have been great yet got nothing, my fam and I all walked out and went to El Nopal which is directly behind this pupusa place as soon as we walked in we got chips n salsa and an amazing friendly smile, we are officially done giving the pupusas place a chance."}
{"text":"Had a good breakfast.  Fast and good food. Nice size pupusas for 2 bucks each.  And I had the casamiento which included eggs with veggies, beans and fried plantains a side of cream and two homemade corn tortillas.  All very good.  Not to much but price was right at 5.50."}
{"text":"Not the first time I come here and also wasn't a different time, always come here for dinner.  Ordered revuelta pupusas which comes with beans, cheese and carnitas. Are half of one then realized their was hardly any meat. If I wanted just bean and cheese I would of ordered it. Pretty disappointed possibly have a new cook that in my opinion is cheap with their ingredients. Just because they wanted to be cheap with the meat I won't come back, nor would I recommend this place. Great customer service though."}
{"text":"Walking in, I was a bit confused on what we should do. Sit down? Wait for someone to lead us to a table? Go to the counter to order. I was a bit upset that no one greeted us but I really wanted to pupusas so I mustered up the strength to just sit down at the table. Finally someone arrived with menus.   Order: Beef Milenasa, 3 pupusas (cheese, mixed, pork) and empanadas leche.  The beef milenasa was delicious. Probably my favorite from what we ordered. The tortillas were different. Thicker and cornier? I liked them. Very filling.  The pupusas were great but the pork and mixed were a bit oily. The extra sour cream that I ordered neutralized the oiliness. The salad was great with it too.   Oh, you also have to scream to get some water. We didn't scream, so we didn't get any water. No one really came back to check on us. Star drop. :o( Sorry, las pupusas."}
{"text":"I live near this place and have been wanting to try their pupusas for a while. The restaurant is large and clean. Prices and menu selection are fair. I phoned in an order for 5 chicken and cheese pupusas. Pupusas were large and fresh. Cheese was gooey but chicken and masa were bland. Curtido and salsa were also bland.   I wont be back. For better pupusas I'll stick to Pupusa Salvadoreno."}
{"text":"The food is average. I ordered tamales and they were gross, undercooked and no flavor, it was like eating oatmeal. The papusas are good. Service is HORRIBLE,waiting over 30 minutes for one papusa when it was slow. If you expect mexican food don't come here, the classic dishes taste funny because it's from El Salvador although it says \"mexican\" food too. Will not be coming here again. Yuck."}
{"text":"Best popusas I've ever had! My hubby and son agree! They're huge by the way! We got the chicken and cheese, and bean and cheese, and man were they bomb! Also the picadio is delicious! The platano frito was amazing!!! Customer service was great! I'm so sad I have to wait to eat here until the next time I come to Vegas but I'm so happy I left the strip to eat some real good food!"}
{"text":"Well I will hold off judgement till later. The first go is a gimme. It's early and they aren't busy yet but it's still going to be 25 minutes for my impromptu order. Which you may think of as a complaint but I consider to be a promising sign."}
{"text":"Don't ever come here. Their customer service is HORRBLE! They try to charge every single thing and the worst part is they charge you $0.99 extra for paying with card. They don't even let you know in advance. When I ask for refund because I have cash, they blame the card machine that it doesn't process refund. Horrible, horrible, horrible."}
{"text":"love this place! my mother in law is from san salvador so i have really developed a taste for yummy pupusas! my hubby and i love coming here. they are friendly and the food is good. every time we come, it is just.....delicious!"}
{"text":"The pupusas are quality and delicious. I recommend the cheese and the ensalada. Hard to find pupusas at this caliber, customer forever."}
{"text":"They get three stars only because the pupusas are really good and made fresh. I have not tried anything else in their menu. I came here in the morning around 10am and they were not busy at all, I placed an order to go, and I had to wait 30 minutes for my food. 30 minutes is just way too long for a restaurant that is slow. I honestly don't think they even checked if my food was ready until one lady noticed I had been sitting there for a while. Next time I will phone my order in and just pick it up."}
{"text":"Queso y Loroco Pupusas for 1.95 each.  Best lunch for the money in Vegas.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best finds in Vegas. They have the best chorizo and eggs in town. I also like that everything is reasonably priced. The $2 papusas are very good sized. My vson just tried the wings and he said \" the best wings he's had at a restaurant\", keep in mind my son is a wing snob. So yes I highly recommend this location. (the other locations aren't as good)"}
{"text":"I think we ate here 3 times on our trip to Vegas. Delicious, cheap, great for kids, friendly service. Do get try horchata, it has an amazing toasted, nutty flavor, much different than mexican horchata. Not sure about the Mexican menu, we stuck with the namesake. The pupusas are amoung the best i've had."}
{"text":"Try this place. And make sure you order Pupusas. It's quite an experience.  Call for pickup or dine in. They take a little a little long to cook, but it's because of the magic that happens in the kitchen to create this masterpiece."}
{"text":"The nachos are incredibly delicious!!! The chips were made fresh so it was really crispy.   I also got the carne asada tacos which were also delicious. As for the pupusas I got the chicken n cheese pupusas and my sister got the pork n cheese pupusa. Both were really good but If I had to choose between the two, It would be the Pork and cheese!"}
{"text":"We decided to try the pupusas here. I haven't had a good pupusa since I spent a summer in Nicaragua a few years ago, obviously these did not taste exactly the same but the quality was pretty comparable. The service was good. It took about 15 minutes to get our food but was worth the wait. The pickled cabbage is a must when eating pupusa. The price is great at $2 each. We each had 2 and were pretty satisfied with the amount of food. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best place to get Pupusas always very friendly an welcoming the food is so good an always fresh this is definitely the only place I go to for some delicious Pupusas and the price is good too"}
{"text":"Muy mal servicio al cliente. para. Nos tomaron nuestra orden y pedimos algo para llevar. Para cuando nos tomaron la cuenta, seles olivido la orden. Esperamos otros 30 mins.Los banos sin papel ingenico. Les avise y con 5 personas ninguna se encarga de eso. 2 personas dedpues tambien les avisaron."}
{"text":"Most delicious and authentic Pupusas. Excellent customer service! Best in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up some dinner to-go. After walking in, hubby and I were very confused since they have no signs saying to seat yourself or anything pointing you to a place for to-go orders. The most confusing part was no employees in sight and no menu board?!?! There wasn't anybody else eating inside either, so I had to wonder if this place was really open for business or not. After a couple minutes a woman came out and asked asked if were were eating in or taking out, so I told her we wanted to place a order to-go. She handed us menus and we sat and looked it over. After only a minute she came back to take our order, but I told her we we hadn't been here before and needed a little extra time to look over the menu. She then comes back I swear less than a minute later and asked if we were ready. Ugh. I felt rushed which made no sense since there were no other customers. I just went ahead and ordered some things that caught my eye.  Bean and Cheese Pupusas ($1.95) - The price was great, but not the taste. I wish I tasted more beans and cheese inside instead of the pasty corn flavor this one had.   Al Pastor Taco ($1.95) - I enjoyed the taco and they were generous with the fillings, but it tasted more like chicken and certainly doesn't stand up against some of the other al pastor around town.   Fried Plantains ($2.50) - Yum! This was the best part! I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor.  The lady who helped us was friendly, but pushy about getting our order taken. I really feel they need to put a menu board up and some signage showing customers if they should seat themselves etc. Price was on point and the plantains were good, but everything else was a miss for me."}
{"text":"They have very good central american food. but that wait time s ridiculous. even  if you order ahead of time it isnt guaranteed that it will be ready. they definitely could use a lot more cooks."}
{"text":"This place us good just keep in mind waiting time is long. If you are going to do a to go order call ahead of time.  DO NOT walk in to do a to go order without calling first. I am saying this because you do not want to wait half an hour just for your food.   Other that that this place offer delicious goodies."}
{"text":"Can't say I was that impressed. First of all it $3.25 for the smallest most basic tostada (beans, sour cream, lettuce & one tomato slice), was a ridiculous price for that one item. The carne asada street tacos were pretty tasty and a pretty good size for the price. I waited for 15 minutes for the three items. That seemed a bit much as well. I had quite a tummy rumble the next day. I can't say with certainty it was the food but I have a feeling it was.   I really wanted to like this place since it is so close to my house. With that being said, I will consider giving this place another try just to see if they had an \"off day\". So, I will update my review after a second trip."}
{"text":"This is the first place we came for Pupusas when we first moved here 6 years ago and to this day we still pop in on occasion for a pupusa fix...  we also tried their \"cheeseless\" nachos, carne asada, chicken encebollado, and their casamiento(Salvadoran Breakfast) which are pretty good as well. Their Pupusas are their \"claim to fame\"  kinda like a hot pocket but only a thousand times better, these bad boys are huge, addicting, and doesn't break the bank, even better when they're cooked nice and crisp with burnt oozing cheese around the edges.  Their horchata is my drink of choice, slightly diiferent from the mexican version(Salvadoran style is made with toasted rice) My wife always gets the ensalada, kinda like a pineapple agua fresca with bits of apple inside. Think its almost time to pay Las Pupusas another visit...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Their Pupusas Revueltas rock, especially when you got extra burnt cheesey bits from the flat top.  I also love their version of Horchata which is made with toasted/burnt rice powder...The masa in their tamales are much softer than Mexican tamales and their Casamiento is also very good but does not come with chorizo like Rincon Catratcho does.  good food overall, and no, you won't hear microwaves, the food is done right before your eyes, they have a see through glass at this location...ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(36/365) \"Pass The Pupusas, Please!\""}
{"text":"the BEST pupusas in the city. You should try the empanadas which are a dessert option - mashed up plataine in a ball shape stuffed with cream. Very delicious!  Son las MEJORES pupusas en la ciudad. Deberían de probar las empanadas que son una opción de postre - plátano machacado en forma de bolita con relleno de crema. Súper delicioso!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I've eaten pupusas.  And they were delicious!      The dishes were great tasting and well portioned.  The prices are affordable and the service was prompt.      What was the downer?  The bathroom wasn't clean...  :(      I was planning to give this place solid four stars, but the trip to the bathroom made me reconsider.        Hopefully, the owner will read this entry and clean that restroom so the customer's last impression won't decrease."}
{"text":"I love to eat here! You can feed the whole family for very little, and their Pupusas are delicious. I also love the location, it's across the street from Craig Ranch Park so we will usually go to Las Pupusas after an afternoon of playing."}
{"text":"Simple and casual.  I like this place.  There's nothing fancy here. It's basically comfort food, Latino style.  I tried the mixed Pupusas.  It was different, but I'll definitely have it again. My main dish was the Salvadorian Arroz con Pollo, that tasted like any other."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing and the staff is super nice. Definitely will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"las pupusas is thee BEST place in vegas by far for (u guessed it) pupusas!!! for anyone who may not know what a pupusa is... google it, bc my explanation is prob not the best... its a staple food from el salvador and u can get it with your choice of cheese, beans or pork (any combo of the three). i always get the 'mixta' which includes all three. first off, i want to say that this review is strictly for the pupusas, so with that said: if u expect to be catered to by your server and checked on every two minutes? dont go here. if u are into \"trendy\" upscale places? dont go here.  if u are in a hurry? dont go here. however, if u want to try some of the best, authentic food from el salvador made fresh by ladies who really know how its done? GO HERE!!! the servers are friendly, the food is very inexpensive and im pretty sure anyone who tries the pupusas will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"Yelp has it right on the money as in it is a 3.5 stars, the food was excellent but the service sucked!   I tried both the pork tamale and the pork chilli, while it was very good the service was just terrible. We never were offered salsa or anything of that nature.   I will probably go back but will expect the terrible service. Service is the only reason they are getting a 2 star over a 4 star as their was a dirty table."}
{"text":"Just go, you wont regret it. TRUST ME. Pupusas to die for. And my fave dessert growing up, plantains with sour creme mmm!"}
{"text":"The pupusas are ok, nothing like homemade but they aren't that bad. Just wish they weren't so greasy. Also I do agree with some other people about that weird smell in there sometimes."}
{"text":"This place has good food and the service is great the only downside is they never turn on the A/C & it feels so hot and stuffy in there.   La comida esta deliciosa y los empleados son amables. Lo único malo es que nunca prenden El aire acondicionado y siempre está caliente adentro del restaurante."}
{"text":"I asked what was best and ended up with shredded beef.  She said definitely better than the pupusas.  Quality of beef was OK and tomato was looking past it's prime.  I dont quite get the positive reviews here.   The tamarind drink was excellent, however."}
{"text":"OMG Batman!  YUMM! I love it here! I have 2 or 3 pupusas when I come and I always have too much! It is so good.   The price is amazing for food this good. 5 bucks for a filling, delicious meal? Yes Sir, I will have another! It beats fast food 100% the price is RIGHT and the food is amazing.  The staff is very polite and friendly. The restaurant is clean. Did I mention the pupusas are out of this world! Get in here!"}
{"text":"3 stars?? You are crazy. This place is excellent! We do not go here as often as we like, as it is not close to my house, but if you love El Salvadorian food, pupusas, in particular, you will love this place. I lived in Wash. D.C. had many El Salvadorian friends ate at some of the best places and this is on par. The only problem is you will leave stuffed. We have been at night and morning and they never fail to satisfy. Before leaving the manager, not sure came to our table and asked if everything was good. My reply was BUENISIMO! ( wonderful! ) I want to post my pictures on yelp but don't know how. B-fast, lunch, dinner, you will not have a better meal. It is REAL food, not the plastic Americans are used to eating, and yes I am a Texan transplant, pero la comida es authentico."}
{"text":"My best go to restaurant in Vegas. I hate Mexican food and have driven past this place for three years because I falsely believed Salvadorian food would be the same as Mexican, boy was I mistaken and so glad I decided to finally try this place. I now go here at least once a week. For flavors and price you will find this place hard to beat. The whole Tilapia or Beef tongue are my favorites and the pork chunks and yucca as well as the chicken and cheese Pupusas are my daughters favorites. Be sure to have some Tamarindo and horchata, they are delicious and different from the Mexican versions I have had. The Salvadorian  Regia beer is also pretty good but comes in a large 32oz bottle so be prepared . Average meal price for two with take home boxes is $25.00 and it doesn't matter when I go the place is always busy with Salvadorian and Mexican patrons as the food is really authentic. Really worth the visit"}
{"text":"We live by Las Pupusas and when it opened, we decided to wait a few months to let them work out the kinks before we tried it...   We walked in and it's a large dining area, but you haven't a clue as to whether you seat yourself or not. We stood around for a few minutes until I noticed that there was a small counter where you order your food. We walked over to the counter and there wasn't a menu board or signage of any sort, so we stood in the line until we were close enough to the counter to see that there was a stack of menus.   The menu had lots of stuff on it, and photos that didn't make anything look appetizing. There were large photos of greasy hamburgers and pizza, and my husband immediately said \"Let's go to Que Mås.\"   We were never greeted, never acknowledged. We were there for 15 minutes and it's like it never happened. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I got a few things to go from here and it was really good.  Impressed overall on the to go menu but haven't sat down to see the service they provide on dine in.  The pupusas were good and empanadas just needed a little sprinkle of sugar on top bit thats a preference."}
{"text":"I came here while I was on vacation in Vegas. it took awhile for them to make the food BUT it was worth the wait because the Pupusas were AMAZING! I would totally go back next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Pupusas are amazing. They are pretty generous with the fillings--hearty. I also had their sopa de gallina india--so delicious!! Definitely my number one spot to go to for Salvadoran food here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The \"street tacos\" are the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Asada with onion and cilantro.   Red salsa has no flavor.   Pupusas have way to much masa, and not enough filling.  Way to greasy. The cabbage topping seemed dry, and didn't taste to well like most places.   I would only come back to this place for tacos."}
{"text":"If I can give them 0 stars I would.. I've been to all of their locations and by far this has been the worst experience ever(it was better when they were at the Stephanie location). When we walked in the placeless that busy yet there was about 4 tables that were dirty we sat down and they didn't bring us menus till 5 minutes after we had sat down, then we waited for another 15-20 minutes and nobody came and ask for our drink order until I finally went up to the counter and ask the lady if she can take my drink order...I'm not even exaggerating but it took about another 20 min for them to come and take our food order. And then we had to wait about 45 min for the food to get to us, I had order a tamale for my daughter I asked the lady to bring it before everyone else's food and she never did my baby girl started crying and getting fuzzy so I had to get up and tell her to bring it, then finally our good got there and my sons and nephews fries were COLD I had to get up and go to the counter to let them know they took t back and when they brought them back they were hard but hot, basically all they did was put the fries back in the frier, at that point we just didn't bother to complain then they brought out my husband soup and guess what the soup was cold so I told them they took it back, my Pupusas taste just like flour and they were burnt, finally after all of us were done with our food they brought out my husbands soup. It was hot but no flavor whatsoever. And the whole time we were there we were never offered refills and they never came and checked on us. I really hope the owners see this Yelp and do something about it because I basically gave them $33 dollars for nothing our food sucked and Service was HORRIBLE.  Si pudiera le diera 0 estrellas pero no me deja hacer eso. Desde el minuto que entramos todo estaba mal habían 4 mesas sucias. Menos mal que encontramos una limpia y nos sentado ahí, no estaban tan llenos pero se tardaron para traernos el menú y después fui yo la que les tuve que decir que queríamos ordenar unas bebidas. Después de eso se tardaron como otros 20 minutos para tomar nuestra orden de comida. Había ordenado un tamal De pollo para mi hija y le Dije a la mucha si me lo podría traer antes de todo por que era para la niña, nunca me lo trajo mi hija se puso a llorar y es cuando me fui a decirle que me lo trajera. Después la comida de todos al fin vino después de espera más de 45 minutos y las papas fritas de mi hijo y sobrino estaban súper heladas las tuve que llevar a la cajera y decirle y después mis Pupusas solamente tenía sabor a masa , las sopa de gallina de mi esposo estába helada se la llevó la muchacha de nuevo. Nos trajo la orden de papas y básicamente lo único que hicieron fue meterlas a la aceite de nuevo y salieron más dura, pera ya hace punto no dije nada la sopa la trajeron ya que todos estábamos listo para irnos. Y desde que ordenamos las bebidas ni tan solamente una vez nos vinieron a preguntar si queríamos más de tomar y tampoco se acercó para decirnos si todo estaba bien. Honestamente espero que el dueño lee esto. Por qué yo básicamente les regale $33  y el servicio tal como la comida no sirvió."}
{"text":"good service, the menu is hard to read the pictures dont match the menu!. place looks clean , service is great!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch and ordered two revueltas pupusas which is a mixture of queso, beans, and chicharron.  I also ordered the horchata and the woman taking my order was nice to point out it was Salvadoran style, not Mexican, which I knew in advance and was OK with.  I took a seat and in about 5 minutes, my pupusas and curitdo were brought to the table.  The pupusas were quite hot and filled with queson.  Good tasting as was the cortido.  I know people pile the coritdo on their pupusas sometimes, but I like them separate for the most past.  I do put some on my fork and then grab a piece of pupusa but that's about it.  Lunch was very pleasant and inexpensive with the pupusas being $1.95 each.  They're also very filling and I walked out with a full stomach and a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Always a five star experience.  You have to try the pork tortas (sandwich) oh, the bread is soooo delicious and soft! Ugh, I love it! This was my husband's dish and I had one bite, then another bite, then...  I ordered the Mexican breakfast: chorizo and eggs which sadly fell short on flavor but I have to remember I'm not at a Mexican restaurant.   But 5 stars for the Loroco and cheese pupusas!   We come here at least 2x a week for either take out or dining.   Friendly service and cheap!"}
{"text":"Well priced food, nice staff, and freshly made food. 1 Pupusa $1.95 comes with a mixed cabbage like slaw. Also, tried their empanada con leche which is a plantain formed like an empanada then inside is milk I believe. It's not as crispy as I expected more soft but still good and unique. I never heard of this type of empanada before. I'd recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I'd never had a puspusa. I heard meat, and cheese inside a corn dough and I was sold. We almost got the food to-go but when the husband spotted the grill with a window where you can watch them cook, we ate in the very front. We ordered 2 puspusas, a Carne Asada quesadilla to share and Nachos to share (yes, we were starving!) The puspusas weren't my husbands idea and he didn't want to try but after some nudging he gave in. And polished that thing off in seconds. It was pretty good. Plain, but after some dosing of hot sauce it was good. For a $1.75 what do you want?! The quesadilla was HUGE and the meat was great, however after a few bites, the puddle of grease under the 'dilla was a turn-off. it dipped like a faucet and WAY more than it should have. We stopped after a few bites because of the grease. The nachos were really good, but be prepared they are not \"mexican\" nachos. NO CHEESE. It really threw me off. They look really plain when they come, the chips were great but on them was only a meat.....not sure what exactly, some brown sauce (watery beans?) and sour cream. They were good....just DIFFERENT. It was filling, we left the whole grease-sadilla on the table. $14 for all the food which wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I once saw a dog pooping and enjoyed it more than this food. This place is lucky because I gave it a star. I'd rather be beaten by a homeless then come here again. Why ? Just why ? Why serve shit on a plate ???????"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed about this place for the following reasons; canned soda, no fountain drinks? Well I'm going to be thirsty before I'm done because I'm certainly not going to order extra. I ordered the fajitas...can't go wrong with fajitas, right?! WRONG! Tortillas were 1/4\" thick and still doughy on the inside. Meat was cut wrong, not grilled or fried yet sautéed with tomatoes, bell peppers. Very saucy so I poured it over my rice and ate it that way. Although I would preferred to have it fajita style it was good this way.  The presentation was haphazard at best, if that was a salad with the rice as a side, it looked horrible. 1 sliced tomato, 1 sliced cucumber, 1 sliced radish!!! Really?!? Yes I close with the fact that there are expectations that need to be met when you patronize a restaurant, I'm afraid they weren't met here today!"}
{"text":"Had to stop cause I was craving it since my friends back in SF were posting their cravings for Pupusas all over FB!! So, stopped in and ordered a cheese/herb and a pork/cheese combo.  They came out warm and gooey...delish! And I had the option of putting as much sauce or as little sauce as I want since they gave me the bottle of sauce. 2 pupusas and a Dos Equis for $7.03!!! Can't beat that price! They also have plenty more on the menu...next time I come back I'm gonna try the seafood soup! Oh, and they were VERY nice...."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service sucked!  Snobby ass girl took our order didn't even come once to check how we were doing waited ten mins till finally someone asked if we wanted our check."}
{"text":"Super clean, friendly service, food is a little slow to come out -- but that's because it's all made from scratch -- and given the ingredients, that's a great thing.    Their salpicon, chopped beef, radish, mint, onions, cilantro, lime, is fresh and fantastic.    Their pasteles are large -- crispy -- either chicken or pork with curtido, they're terrific.    Their pupusas are best well done -- but they don't quite get that instruction -- but then I don't speak spanish... but they're quite good -- I'm partial to the queso y loroco.  With the curtido and spicy sauce, mmmmmmgood.   Think Salvadoran version of grilled cheese & tomato soup (ok cold tomato soup), regardless, definitely comfort food.    Today, their mixto cocteles was mostly tomato -- los tacos and la palapa have better ones, but that's ok.    We watched a young woman enjoying her sieptes mares -- and it looked truly spectacular.    And their flan, if you're not planning on dessert from Freed's next door, is truly transcendent.  This place is HUGE, great for groups, extremely inexpensive, fresh & fantastic, plus close to UNLV -- at Eastern @ Trop."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Pupusas in general so I don't have too much to say about that. But if you are at this location, you should watch how they make it. There is a window to the kitchen so you can watch the ladies make it. It's a skill.  Holy moly, their tamales are incredible. I like that they are made with a soft and smooth corn meal, instead of the Mexican style of grainier corn meal. The flavor of the tamale is also really buttery, which comes from the lard?! Both the chicken and pork are good and the probably the same filling for the Pupusas.   Don't forget to try their apple salad. This is a fruit based drink with diced apples . Not sure what is exactly in it but it's good...  See you soon, my favorite tamales...."}
{"text":"my cousin introduced me to pupusas when i visited him in california. i came home fiending for them. i started asking around and las pupusas was the number one spot.   i had a bean and cheese pupusa and a revuelta(mixed chicharones, beans, and cheese) pupusa, two, pork salvadorian(theyre more wet than mexican and rapped in a banana leaf)  tamales, and plantanos empanadas. i devoured everything and nothing was going to stop me. i cant wait to go back and try new things."}
{"text":"This place is trash. I seriously don't know how they've stayed open thus far. I came in at about 3 pm and waited to be seated. A young girl approached, maybe 17 years old, didn't even make eye contact just told me to follow her. She dropped the menus on the table and walked off. I waited 40 minutes and nothing... So I just left."}
{"text":"This is a small very ethnic restaurant with great prices and even better food.  I finally had the opportunity to come with my daughter here and we ordered one of each Pupusa, knowing we couldn't eat them all, but hey they were under $2 each and we wanted a \"taste\"  We liked all of them, but REALLY loved the ones with meat in them.  The chicken, pork and beef were super tasty.  Then we loved the zucchini and last was the refried beans one.  We felt the bean pupusa was lacking in flavor.  When you try these El Salvadorian \"quesadillas\", make sure to top them with the coleslaw and the sweet sauce they serve them with.  They are good on their own, but when you comibine all those flavors and textures, they become REALLY good.  This is a casual place, that is great for the entire family and it won't break your savings.  I also recommend getting their aqua fresca, it's very yummy and refreshing."}
{"text":"I love pupusas, but not with hair. I'm pregnant but after ordering some to go yesterday I can't eat them the same no more. They are good but not with hair."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's because I made a large order but my food wasn't cooked all the way. My son and I got horrible horrible food poisoning. I missed 4 days of work and Valentine's Day. I'm highly upset because I loved when my coworkers would bring it in for me and the one time I go there I damn near die from dehydration. I know food poisoning is possible at any place but if you are cooking pork you need to cook it all the way. I'm on day 5 and still not better. Quick care can't even do anything for me. Just tread lightly eating here"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it is usally good. We came here tonight and ordered Pupusas de revueltas and horchata. Well the hoechata was not the kind im used to (mexican style) and it was horrible to me. We asked the waitress for waters and she took offense to us not liking the drinks.  We got past that. Our pupusas came our fairly quickly and were nice and hot. Too bad they were the wrong kind. We felt bad and didnt want to offend the lady again so we ate them. They gave us bean and cheese.   I hate going to a place where you know there will be a language barrier and we came all the way across town from red rock area and we get the wrong food.  We could have easily sent it back but it was hard enough to communicate the horchata ordeal. If you come here be sure to bring someone that speaks spanish or else theyll hardly talk to you and mess up your order."}
{"text":"Awesome Salvadoran cusine at a reasonable price! I usually get their steak burrito for $5...definitely a value--the spicy hot sauce paired with it is spicy but absolutely to die for!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait a while here (15-20 mins for 3 pupusas, beans and rice) or call in over the phone so you're order will be ready when u get there. This is my 2nd time here, and they make the food as you order, so u get piping hot, fresh pupusas! U can see them making the dough, and forming them as you order. What I like are that they also have vegetarian pupusas, which most places do not, and if they do its just bean/ cheese. This place had \"sucini\" ones among others which is how they spelled \"zucchini\" and it was delicious! Also, prices are really great for what I order!"}
{"text":"Good food just horrible customer service. Waiters do t acknowledge you and have a horrible attitude, typical salvadoreña lady's. But never the less, really good and long wait times"}
{"text":"Food is really good. Customer service is horrible. Every time I call to place an order for pick up  I am put on hold and forgotten about for at least 20 minutes. I understand that whoever answers may not speak English but that doesn't mean place someone on hold for such a long time. It's absolutely ridiculous. I just had to hang up and wait for them to realize they forgot about me on the phone before I could try to call back and attempt to order some food."}
{"text":"I love the nachos carne asada here, and the Papusas are decent. Prices are not bad either... But the service is really slow and the bathrooms need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"I came here because i was starving and saw 4stars out of 50 reviewers. I think It's authentic Salvador food but I don't think it's for my taste buds. I'm so used to the usual Mexican style tamales (i got pork and chicken)The corn was super soft like they used too much water in the mix. The flavor was okay a bit bland (I used a lot of tapitio hot sauce).  My husband also got chicken with cheese pupusas, it wasn't good like two stars. But the crust on the edge was good. The sauce for the pupusas was so bland and water down that I couldn't even tell what it was. The cabbage that came along with it was okay too, It was in the vinegar sauce.   There wasn't really any service but they are nice. The food took awhile to come out as well.   I don't think I'll come back since the food I got was watered down and bland. Hope I don't get sick x["}
{"text":"Love the Pupusas friendly staff fast service great family atmosphere great food highly recommended.  Awesome value for what you get the hot chocolate is authentic mexican chocolate I must try I loved the horchata is excellent make sure you stir made from scratch not a mix.  The flan is really firm more like a cheesecake which the non flan likers at the table really enjoyed"}
{"text":"A great place great prices great food good service would highly recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed the pupusas and the horchata was very authentic."}
{"text":"There are a ton of Salvadorian restaurants throughout Las Vegas. Big ones, small ones, mini-chains, etc. I've tried a few, but keep coming back to this one. Maybe its because one of my best friends is a Salvadorena, or maybe it is because I've never met a Salvadoreno I didn't like, but the namesakes of this place are amazing. I've had many different kinds of the pupusas here, but on my last visit I had the been and cheese. They were like heaven. Each bite more delicious than the last. I also had an order of plantains...can't get enough of these, and Las Pupusas does them just as good as any of the Cuban restaurants in town. The group I was with all had different things (carne asada, pupusas, salad, etc...) and all were very very happy with their selections. It was a Wednesday night around 6:30, and the place was pretty busy (mind you, this place is big for a \"hole in the wall\")...mostly families but a fair share of people picking up dinner to take home.  I particularly like this place because they are patient. Sometimes when you don't speak the language the staff can be really impatient, or even rude...not the case at Las Pupusas, they are very friendly, very patient and will make substitutions if you ask nicely. My meal of 3 pupusas, plantains and water was around $6 and I was super full. I don't know anywhere else where I can get this feeling (that is not the Terrible's Buffet or Cici's Pizza) in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I am SOo happy they opened a Pupusa chain in Las Vegas.  I've had these homemade & this place is the closest thing to it! If you've never had a Pupusas it's a handmade masa stuffed in usually pork, beans, cheese or chicken all or one or 2? How ever you would likeTopped with a vinegar slaw & a tangy sweet red sauce. Then cooked on a stone.. You can watch the ladies work their magic as they are made to order.. Now that is some generational skills passed down.  If you've never had one I suggest you try.."}
{"text":"Good pupusas, but even better nachos! We really miss living in Vegas because we haven't found a place close to use we just as good pupusas. Good and friendly service and enough space."}
{"text":"I had two demands when my better half was relocated to Vegas 1) a house with a pool  2) Finding an El Salvadorean place to get pupusas.   I love Pupusas because they invite you to partake in a bit of Mayan culinary antiquity. Masa lovingly rolled by hand and slapped on a sizzling grill, topped with cabbage curtido and a light tomato salsa. My favorite is the queso con loroco pupusa's. Loroco is a fragrant mesoamer  flower whose herbal leaves are mixed with the cheese and stuffed inside the masa_Divine I say!  The platanos are also very good here. The pupusa's here are lard free and very light, which is really key. A great vegetarian dinner for about 6 dollars. Be prepared, this is a homestyle joint, with blaring telemundo and sticky floors~ but it all adds to the autheticity and great meal."}
{"text":"Food is made as you order it so its nice and fresh, BUT, be prepared to wait a bit longer than your order at Del Taco (but man is it worth it...)  They obviously serve a mean pupusa if you didn't notice the name of the joint, and man are they amazing (and extremely well priced)."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Every time I go to vegas I stop at this place.... Drool. There pupusas are amazing, nice crispy crust and flavorful inside. Horchata to die for! And their dessert is amazing to share. It's super sweet but their unsweetened mint drink compliments the super sweet fried balls of dough. Sigh... Can't wait to go back to las Vegas..."}
{"text":"I love the food and the service! They have the best pupusas and tamales in town. We've had the chicharrones and yuca plate which is filled with flavor. today we tried their fried bananas and it was great.  Portions are big too. The people here are very attentive and the prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here. We were a little hungry and decided to grab a small bite to eat. There are 3 of us dining tonight and we ordered these entrees: my wife ordered 3 tacos (carne asada) her cousin ordered 2 tacos (carne asada) and I ordered a burrito with just meat cheese and cream. 45 minutes later they bring out our order, we had to remind them as well.  We got our food, it wasn't hot...it was warm...but my burrito was cold...it was full chunks of cheese and like no meat. I'm upset because how does it take 45 minutes for 5 tacos and a simplified burrito? Never wasting my time and money here again."}
{"text":"My families first time eating here. Food was delicious! And price was perfect!! Pupusas $2. We had chicken and cheese, and chicarones. So good! Tacos $2. Al pastor and carnitas. My daughter devoured it. Nachos crispy chips and good. They even had hamburger and fries for my little boy who is the pickiest eater. We all enjoyed our food. Restaurant clean. Service was nice and attentive. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Slow service, decent food, bad sopa de pata. Like the pupusas but if i had an option i avoid it."}
{"text":"Just walk in and sit down in front of the kitchen window, the waitress will be with you shortly............ I ordered the fried plantains, crema, and refried bean plate with two pupusas.  Too much food for one person, the plantain plate is best shared with at least another person,  I ate pupusas dipped in the crema/bean sauce and ended up taking half of it home for later.  Great place, will come back soon"}
{"text":"OMG Awesome!  Great Tacos, if you go on a Sunday expect a line!  Great Prices, Great Food, Great Service!  A little hard to find, and if you are specific about food, you might want to bring a Spanish speaker.  I will definitely become a regular!"}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic delicious pupusas this is the place to be! The food is great and affordable. The restaurant is very neat and well kept."}
{"text":"You walk into this place and it looks like a hole-in-the-wall dinner.  The tables are a little tipsy, the chairs are purely functional, the floor reminds me of a hospital cafeteria. That's right... and if it wasn't for the pure deliciousness being served at this restaurant I would never go back... However, this was simply the best Mexican food I've ever had.  I'll add for the sake of full disclosure that I know very little about Mexican food--my friend who was with me, however, is married to a Mexican girl--born and bred.  They go to Mexico City to visit her family all the time and he loves his spicy, fresh full of flavor Mexican taco (the food, not his Chiquita :).  My friend said it was authentic--we're not talking tex-mex... real deal solid food.   Just ignore the décor..   Oh... and the prices were so cheap that I felt like I was cheating them."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Las Popusas. My first time there with two ladies from the office. It is a great Salvadorian lunch spot. No bells or whistles it just about the food. You can not beat it as a value proposition. The server was friendly and our order was prompt and very tasty. I had two pupusas. One beans and cheese and the other with chicken. I enjoyed them both. Again this is not fancy place but if you are open to good lunch spot this is it. We all had two popusas and a drink total bill just under $25.00"}
{"text":"Stick with ordering just the pupusas.  I had a chile cheese relleno and cheese enchilada.  The chile relleno was hard on one side and the enchilada tasted terrible.  I should have known from experience just to stay with what they are known for their pupusas."}
{"text":"Place was clean, service was friendly, and prices were fair. Sadly, Yelp.had this place listed as Mexican and not Salvadoran.  I went ahead and tried the pupusas and it was different but not a \"wow\" moment.  The describe way that I could describe it would be if a gordita had a baby with a tamale.  I did like the slaw and sauce that was paired with it. I will also note that the time it took for my to go order seemed a bit excessive. All in all, I will likely return and give the other Salvadoran food a chance."}
{"text":"Love the pupusas platanos fritos and dont get me started on the caldo d camarron is soooooooo goood !! I absolutely love this place"}
{"text":"This place was delicious and cheap! The papusas were huge and not greasy just how they should be. Defiantly will be eating here often!"}
{"text":"First time here. The mixed pupusas were very good but could have had more pork and cheese, and less beans. Slaw was a little bland, but spiced up w hot sauce nicely. Plantains w sour cream and beans was excellent! I expected poor service based on previous reviews. Yet, at 6:00 on a Friday, I was helped almost immediately and food came quickly. Waitresses were friendly and helpful. No problemo and I'll be back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"Pupusas review only:   Why do they almost always get my order wrong? I speak Spanish and English, but sometimes I just want to order a delicious pupusa without turning it into an international incident. Good luck with this place if you don't speak Spanish, though. I asked for 8 pupusas with frijoles, pollo, y queso (beans, chicken, and cheese), and since I never dine-in at pupusas restaurants, I didn't realize that they totally forgot the frijoles until I got home. Also, they were a great deal greasier than the ones that I get from the Las Pupusas on Valley View and Desert Inn (they speak even less English at this location, but at least the pupusas aren't as greasy).  The atmosphere reeked of the Bald Guy on the bottle of cleaning solution and the dining area is a bit too bright, pedestrian, and family style for my taste. Carry-out is the only option for me at either location.  So, all-in-all I would say they were alright. I love the pickled cabbage and the sauce that goes on top (what's the name of that flavorless red stuff anyway?). Sometimes I just get a craving for pupusas, and since it's one of the few items I've yet to venture to create in my own kitchen, I'm pretty much at the mercy of the non-English speaking pupusas crafters.  Next Friday, I will try the pupusas joint on Eastern and Tropicana, which serves up 99cent pupusas on Lunes y Viernes  (Mondays and Fridays) for carry-out. But only if I can get there early enough (pupusas joints close WAY early)."}
{"text":"I decided to come back to this place and forget about my last experience. I tried the bistre encebollado for only 8 buscks! Great flavor, good service and no hairs on my food! Lol! I will def come back to this place !"}
{"text":"Worst service Ever. The big fat girl and short littl young girl just kept talking and laughing Finished my drink and I was waiting for 15 for a refill i couldn't eat anymore bc I was choking. After 15 minutes my food got cold couldn't finish it. I ordered mozzarella sticks and it was cold worst place to come to eat"}
{"text":"Rica popusas ! Precios exelente ! Uno d mis mejores lugarez para desayunar.  Lo unico el servicio no bueno..  La mesera tarde mucho en atender.  Estaba 15vminutes de espera en mesa y el restaurante no esta lleno para k y uno diga que estaba ocupada.  Pero eso si la comida es una delicia..!"}
{"text":"Las pupusas were amazing! The staff was great, and the restaurant was very clean. I'm a vegetarian and there were plenty of yummy options for me!"}
{"text":"Got a bunch of Pupusas, first time I ever had it. I really liked it. Good place and cheap prices"}
{"text":"I was a Salvadorean virgin before Las Pupusas and am so increibly glad they were my first. Yum. Delish. To-die-for. A cheap plate of delectables. Excellent value off of the strip. Friendly staff, even friendlier locals. Leave room for dessert; there's a world famous bakery (rightly so!) next door."}
{"text":"Las Pupusas has multiple locations around the valley but this one is my favorite. Besides a few dishes here and there, I haven't explored much of the Salvadorian cuisine. Pupusas, although, I have quite the taste knowledge in. Similar to Mexican gorditas, pupusas are thick tortilla corn pockets filled with different combinations of cheese, meat (pressed pork rinds), loroco (an edible flower, tastes like asparagus), zucchini, and beans. Rebueltas are the most popular (meat, cheese, and beans), my favorite are zucchini and cheese.   This specific location is really nice because it's newer and very clean. They future a large glass display window there you can watch where the pupusas are being freshly made. They are served with curtido (pickled cabbage with oregano and other spices) which is delicious. What I really like about this location is that they cut the curtido in very fine Julianne, unlike other places that serve it super chunky.   I've had their tamales, wrapped in banana leafs, but they lacked some serious salt. Don't be fooled, the horchata is very different from the Mexican one. To me it tasted like burned rice but they have many other drinks to pick from. Some of my favorites are Ensalada (fresh fruit water, tastes like pineapple and it has tiny bits of apple) or the famous Salvadorian soda Cola Champagne.   Did I mention pupusas are very filling, delicious melted goodness and they are CHEAP?!?!"}
{"text":"Las Pupusas offers one of the best values in food: $1.75 per pupusa, with filling options that include chicken, cheese & herb, bean and cheese, and mixed.  Order two of these, which get served with a shredded lettuce salad and red sauce, and you have a really, really good meal for less than $5!    I haven't tried anything else on the menu (the pupusas are such a good deal it's hard to pass them up!), but I'm sure they will be just as delicious.  The kitchen has a big window that allows you to see all the prep and cooking taking place.  Food is made to order, so be patient as it's worth the wait.  For value and quality, I can't recommend this place enough if you're in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is not worth going to. I definitely recommend the other locations. From waitstaff to the food. The pupusas were big but if you can't eat them what's the point. They were not cooked and they had no flavor. It was my first time ordering Salvadoreño horchata and I didn't like it so I asked to just exchange it for a soda; the waitress was so rude about it and took about 2 minutes to get. Mind you the restaurant had 3 people in it. Overall, worst location I've been to"}
{"text":"I came here like 2 weeks ago and took my pupusas to go & they were delicious! My fiancée and I came again today since we had such a good time the last time, but we ate inside. This place has the WORST customer service ever. Not only that, but being a restaurant, refills for sodas should be free refills like every other place. I'd understand with horchata or anything else not being free for the refills. They charged $0.50 for refills, $0.50 to get hot sauce and more.  They also tried to charge $500.00 on the receipt for things I didn't even get! I'll post a picture on that. Bathroom was nasty, too. Worst experience ever, I will 100% not go back to this place."}
{"text":"The food here is good. The best things are the Pupusas. The prices aren't bad for the kind of food you're getting. The service is good as well. However, there are times when our orders would come out at different times such as an entree would come out before and appetizer or where dishes that take longer to prepare come out before food that's quick and easy.  The last time I was there, the waitress informed us that their terminal was not accepting cards because it was out of service but after we were done eating. Good thing I had cash on me since they expected us to go to the nearest atm and come back to pay... ?"}
{"text":"Just as good as it was before! The only thing is that they getting cheap on their currtido lol, I ordered about 20 something pupusas for a get together and was really shorted on it. I went again later and same thing.  Oh also you wouldn't think it but their quesadailla de carne asada, OMG! I know carne asada trust me and the way the season and cook their meat is really top notch."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!  The food is amazing!! SO GOOD! PUPUSAS!!!! Please the everyone who works there are so friendly."}
{"text":"Not the most fanciest dining experience but the Papausas are the best I have had around and would recommend."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at this location for about 8 years. Throughout this time, they have remained consistent. I am no expert on Salvadorian food, but i have had my fair share of pupusas and I prefer them from this restaurant. I also highly recommend the carne asada burrito. Will continue to revisit and recommend."}
{"text":"I like this place! Friendly service and the food is YUM!   Centrally located not far from the UNLV area, this is Salvadorean home cooking! The prices are really really reasonable and you get a lot."}
{"text":"Food is super tasty and always tastes fresh. I am not a Spanish speaker and they are more than accommodating when it comes to explaining the menu. Very nice staff and very good food."}
{"text":"Where do I friggin begin?   Well, I was on the north side of town with my hubby and family getting haircuts at our fave barber. I go next door for a pedi/brow wax and all is good. We stopped for lunch last weekend and decided to try this place since we liked the Henderson location last time. First impression....COLD. Literally and figuratively, that is. We looked on the wall at the thermostat and it was 61 degrees in the joint. WTF? It was 38 degrees outside! C'mon. Put out the money to keep your patrons happy and get some heat up in the hizzy.   Next, we ordered a quesadilla plain, 2 pupusas, and some chorizo and eggs. No big deal right? Wrong. We had to send back the quesadilla, and they gave us one too many pupusas on the plate. When we mentioned this after her already having left the table, she took the plate back and re-plated with the correct amount of pupusas. Why did they take the extra one? Shouldn't that be the \"oh sorry, have one on the house for the mix-up\" type of offering? I mean, you would think they just threw it away back there, right?  Maybe, maybe not. Now I will tell you about the cleanliness of the place. They need to be visited by the health district and take some classes on how to properly handle and store food. The masa they use for the pupusas is prepared by bare hands. I know this because I watched everything go down through their open glass wall looking directly into their kitchen. I saw the lady touch the handle of her spatula with her masa-soaked hands leaving it sticky. I then watched as the front register lady (who touches the money) used the spatula to flip a pupusa. Then the masa lady touched the spatula again and again. This is only one offense I will mention.   I would have been more forgiving if I saw even one person, in the hour that I was there, wash their hands. The sink remained unused the whole time. No wonder my husband and I felt the afterburn an hour after leaving. You know what I'm talking about. Shame on you Las Pupusas.  Avoid this place like Richard Gere avoids gerbils."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but service sucked!!! Took forever to order.  Had to atop waitress to request a refill on soda, they never noticed the glasses were empty. Also had to go go to counter to request check and then back up to pay check. If we ever come here again, it would be for a pick up only!!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, these Pupusas were great!  I had two and two pork carnitas tacos.  Some of the best Mexican food I've had here in Las Vegas.  There was no one in the joint when we arrived, which was fine with me.  It was a Saturday early afternoon.  The menu is sizable but I knew what I wanted.  The food came out pretty fast and it was everything I thought it would be.  I can't wait to back to this place!"}
{"text":"This location has to be one of the best places in Las Vegas to get Pupusas. The restaurant itself is very spacious and has plenty of seating area.  When you enter you have a seat anywhere you want and some one will bring you a menu, and utensils.  If you don't feel like eating there you can order ahead of time and pick it up.  They have a pretty good menu and plenty to choose from but the main thing to order are the Pupusas.  You can order the Pupusas on the menu or you can create your own. The chicharon, bean, and cheese Pupusas is what I order. I like to order the Salvadoranian Horchata which is so delicious, and refreshing and just goes well with the meal.  The Pupusas are good in size, three of them hit the spot! The Pupusas are made to order so you get them fresh and hot! The taste is so good because they are made to order. The curtido, or cabbage they give you is fresh and crunchy and it's a good serving as well, and compliments the plate very nicely.  Overall this place is in my humble opinion one of the best places to get a good Pupusa, I've tried other restaurants but this place definitely ranks amongst the best."}
{"text":"It is difficult to review a restaurant when there is an hour wait for pupusas. They are either very good, and therefore they may want to expand the kitchen, or not managed well? I will update my review after the next visit."}
{"text":"havent ate in the restaurant since we always order take out. the staff is friendly. love the pupusas."}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews on yelp I thought I would try this place on a night when my wife was away since she is funny about new places.  I ordered 2 mixed pupusas and they were good.  I would probably come back again."}
{"text":"I come here for cheap yet delicious pupusas! I typically order the bean and cheese or revuelte, or just plain cheese. Sometimes chicken. The ensalada (fruit drink) always compliments the meal as well :) Wish there was one closer to my house but it's worth the drive. Location has lots of space and lovely decorations."}
{"text":"It is so hard to choose what you want because everything looks and sounds so good on the menu. We moved back to the north and this was one of our favorite spots, and glad to see it has moved to a larger building. The pupusas though have not changed, and that my friends, is a good thing. We get great pupusas each time and your food is ready quick. I also love the plantains with the crema to go along with my meal. Definitely a go to place that just feels right!"}
{"text":"Walked in did not know if I had to order at counter or sit down, cashier did not fully understand, thought I wanted take out. The room temp was 92 degrees according to the temp on the wall, so it was a bit uncomfortable. The openness of the kitchen was nice if your sitting in front of it, the menu was confusing most of the items are  in pictures & no prices until you turn to the back, trying to match up prices with picture was difficult. I ordered a el pastor burrito & diet coke. Food was served on a ungarnished plate with cup of sauce, The burrito was only meat witch tasted good and white rice no beans no cilantro, no tomato or onions, I  had to ask again for my drink I did not get, it came in a 12oz can I also had to ask for my check when I was finished servers need to be more attentive. Is probable I will not return!"}
{"text":"The bean & cheese pupusas is delish, I order it every time I go in along with a carne asada taco.  The food is always made fresh to order & service is great.  The pricing is excellent.  I go to the Henderson location while at work & the location on Craig Rd when I'm close to home.  This restaurant is a must have for a quick quality meal......"}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place one day driving by and piqued my curiousity. I do love pupusas but it's been years since and the BF never had one.   We started off with some of their horchata which is Salvadorean style. That style is not milky cinnamon but had much more of a strong cinnamon, nutmeg and chocolate flavor to it. Liked it, but it was perhaps a bit too strongly flavored for me.   We got two pupusas - bean& cheese and the revueltas (mixed). Theirs was good and served piping hot. Curtido was nice and the chilled slaw with a hot pupusa was a really nice temperature and flavor contrast. I prefered the mixed one as that is what I'm used to eating in LA, the BF preferred the bean&cheese one.   BF ordered to share a garlic shrimp plate. The shrimp was fresh, cooked right and the seasoning was decent. It came with white rice, beans that were more liquidy/pasty, salad, tortillas (basically unfilled pupusas).   Service was decent enough.   I think I would come back here for the pupusas for sure. They're cheap, filling, and done really well here. Definitely, their namesake is solid."}
{"text":"All I can say is everything was terrible except the wait staff.  Food was not worth eating - left it on the plate.  Even the rest rooms were terrible. Filthy, nasty, shit was in commodes, floors wet with urine.  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Great services  Great food   I love coming to this place for breakfast   If you are a new comer and would like a tip on what to order, just go for what they stand out for Pupusas. There chicken and cheese Pupusas are to die for, don't forget to add the veggies and DROWN it in there sauce   As far as desserts flan is the way to go, you are never to full for a slice of flan"}
{"text":"Maybe my taste in men has helped me feel less awkward in situations or restaurants like this. Having once had a Hispanic boyfriend allows you to escape the awkwardness of being the token Asian in an establishment, but when you end at Las Pupusas with your Asian brother, the discomfort is inescapable - in fact, it is exponentially multiplied. With the intrigue of pupusas lingering, the both of us were willing to endure the uneasiness. We sat down - ordered a plate of plantains and three pupusas - mix, cheese and pork.  The Mexicans have tortas, the Venezuelans have arepas, the Salvadoreans have pupusas. All of these things have some similarities: take some dough, throw in either cheese, meat or both of these things, and you're done! But mind you, even though these are only $1.75, they are huge. When they came out, we were stunned. Eating them, the flavor is just as big the pupusa itself. The mix with beans and cheese was the best in its simplicity. The cheese was another favorite with that salty cheese that oozed out and made a crust. The pork was not our favorite - its texture grounded to a pulp and flavor just being 'meh'. Throw on some of the slaw they give you, and one pupusa could be a meal in it of itself. The plantains, on the other hand, were also just as good. Perfectly fried up, fresh, and teetering between sweet and savory - they were my first plate of plantains and certainly not my last.  Consider me a Hispanic food hipster, but as I grow older, I am now branching out into these lesser-hyped, obscure cuisines. It's places like this that perpetuate my interest and hunger to try the new and unknown. While initially uncomfortable, I now take the amount of discomfort to directly correlate to the deliciousness of a place - in this case, it's damn good."}
{"text":"Onion steak was incredible!  Came for lunch, didn't wait long.  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a very long time, being salvadorian I am the biggest critic. But nothing ever taste better than moms cooking right? Sometimes mom likes to get treated. We had pupusas with grinded pork with cheese. They are huge and delish , we also had plantains with beans and sour cream add sugar and your good to go. Service was great. Definitely on my top two salvadorian locations.   Spanish translation below   Tengo mucho tiempo de no venir a esta locación, siendo salvadoreña soy la primera en criticar. Pero nada nunca se compara con la comida de mamá verdad? Y a veces debemos invitarla a comer en vez de que ella cocine. Comimos unas Pupusas de chicharrón con queso. Estaban grandísimas y deliciosas también comimos plátanos con frijoles y crema le agregas azúcar y está  todo listo. El servicio estuvo excelente. Definitivamente Éste local está en los mejores dos para mi."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The service was average, not friendly,  but not rude. The place appeared clean."}
{"text":"Love love love their Pupusas!! I live down the street and used to make my husband bring some home for me when I was pregnant! I love their curtido y salsa de tomate. My husband loves their carne con yuca!"}
{"text":"BEST- Tamales and pupusas. Tamales are only $1.60 and pupusas are $1.75 this will not break the budget but you will be completely satisfied. I have been to so many mexican joints in Vegas and YUCK. Trust me you won't regret eating here."}
{"text":"Excellente! 3 bean and cheese pupusas and the world is okay. Have some ensalada..and make it grande. The shrimp cocktail is great too. Their Salvadorean sodas are hard to find but they have them here. They play futbol and novelas so you can catch up while you grub up. Oh, and it's clean and the ladies who serve are super sweet. Yum!"}
{"text":"One of the two or three best meals I've had in Vegas, and the price was under eight bucks!  I'll be coming back here for a looooong time.  The Good: 1)  Incredible pupusas recipe.  Fresh, hot, delicate.  I've had them other places and they weren't done as well. 2)  Preposterously cheap.  If it cost twice as much it would still be a bargain. 3)  Lots of variety on the menu. 4)  Reasonably fast service.  The Bad: 1)  The ambiance is low rent, but that's consistent with most restaurants at this price point.  Heck I've seen taco trucks that are more expensive than Las Pupusas."}
{"text":"Going off of the reviews here I ordered 2 pork and bean pupsas thinking that the size would be sufficient. Now, I'm a pretty big eater and probably could've gone with 3 to satisfy my hunger. Though 2 was sufficient for a lunch time meal. The pupusas were not greasy at all and they tasted great. I'd definitely go back, being that it's 2 blocks away from work, and maybe try some of the other ones next time."}
{"text":"The food is good, pupusas are great, beans not to good as they are canned and dry.  The \"ensalada\" drink is SO SWEET, if you order this ask for another glass of water to go with it.  I would rate their food a 3 out of 5.... THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE A 0 OUT OF 5....   Now that I got that out of the way, their waiters / customer service is the WORST I've ever encountered.  Our waiter was impatient and short.  My husband asked for two eggs, over medium.  She brought them with the solid yolk...  he asked if she could kindly redo them over med as he initially requested, he was not rude about this at all.  She said they could only redo 1 egg for him because he had eaten one of the eggs.... (which was a lie)  I was just in huge shock... after pointing out they had made the mistake and just voicing my disgust in the whole ordeal, they agreed to redo the 2 eggs.   So... moral of the story, if you want decent pupusas I reccomend \"Las Pupusas\" but order takeout."}
{"text":"One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just doesn't belong. Ok, the last line might be an exaggeration. At first, as the only minority in the whole restaurant, it made me feel like a Caucasian walking into Chinatown. In the end, good food transcends all boundaries and I am down to devour it all.  I came here with my sister since we have always wanted to try Pupusas. Not exactly sure what they were, made us want them even more. We ordered the mix, cheese, and pork thinking it would be a light meal. Add an order of plantains and it is a done deal. My sister's eyes grew big while I was ordering, but I reassured her that they couldn't be that big for $1.75. Boy was I wrong. If you are going by pictures, look at the scale of pupusas to plate ratio. These big stuffed flat breads are superb.  The mix and cheese were the best because of the nice crispy edges. My con artist of a sister stole the end where the cheese oozed out because it had such a delicate texture. That is the last time I cut it down the middle to share the good parts. For $8, we had a decent size meal for two averagely hungry people. Even in ravenous mode, it would not be expensive to dine here, because everything is so inexpensive.   The service was friendly, but it takes the kitchen some time to turn out food. Now that I know what a pupusa is, the mystery is gone, yet a yearning for more fills that spot."}
{"text":"My supervisor had some raving compliments about Las Pupusas, claiming that the restaurants multiple locations is one of his favorite spots that he and his wife frequent. I've personally never tried Salvadorian food, but after hearing so many good things - I knew I had to give it a try.   I was able to visit the Eastside location on a weekday for lunch. The storefront is located in a pretty big plaza with lots of parking. The store itself is quite big with many tables. Seemed like many people from the nearby vicinity ordered to-go during lunch hour, although customers are welcome to sit and be assisted by the server as well.   The menu is pretty self-explanatory. They offer pupusas (hence the name) at $1.99 a piece as well as breakfast items, Salvadorean dishes, seafood, Mexican food, burgers, and desserts. Seeing as the restaurant is named Las Pupusas, I knew I had to try them. There are a variety of options - you can have the pupusas revueltas (beans, cheese, pork) or have chicken with cheese, beans with cheese, etc. They come with curtido (fermented cabbage relish) and a type of salsa.   I ended up ordering 3 pupusas since I thought \"why not?\" but the pupusas are actually pretty big - similar to the size of a pancake. I think two would have been more than enough. Out of the three that I tried - revueltas, beans with cheese, and chicken with cheese - I liked the beans with cheese the most. Tasted a bit like a burrito and I enjoyed the flavors of the filling. I also was the most hungry when I ate that one though - the revuelta was not too bad either. The pork gave it some extra flavor than just the beans with cheese; however, the chicken with cheese was my least favorite. I thought the chicken was not too tasty and was a bit bland. Eating the pupusas with the curtido definitely tasted better than eating it plain. The cabbage and salsa gave it an extra kick, which I enjoyed.   I also got to try the empanadas de platano con leche (plaintains) $3.99 - they're a tasty treat if you're in the mood for something sweet. I'm not a big plaintain person, but even I thought they tasted pretty good.   After eating, you can pay at the front. Workers were friendly and helpful, and the food came out quickly. While I still don't get a craving for Salvadorian food, I'm glad I got the chance to try it out and see for myself what my supervisor was always raving about!  tl;dr - Las Pupusas is a great place to visit if you're in the mood for Salvadorian food and want to grab something that won't take too long. The pupusas were solid and at $1.99 each, quite a good deal. I wouldn't mind returning and trying some of the other items that they have on the menu!"}
{"text":"I just found a new favorite place to eat. It has been years since I had Pupusas so when I passed by this restaurant I had to stop in and give it a try. I ordered way too much unknowingly, but I'll happily eat the leftovers tomorrow. I had the girls with me and we ordered 3 revueltos Pupusas and 3 queso Pupusas and a cheese quesadilla. The Pupusas were like ooey gooey heaven!!! I liked the mildness of the queso pupusas, you could really taste the corn tortilla dough. The revueltos pupusas had a wonderful flavorful saltiness to it that was offset by the mild frijoles.  I tried a bit of the quesadilla and it was delicious too, the cheese was so creamy and milky like it melted in my mouth. To top this all off, the girls got to watch the cook make the Pupusas and cook them on the grill. I will definitely return here!!!"}
{"text":"This place compared to other pupusa places was not that great the pupusas were dry & didn't have much flavor. We also had the nachos & the ground beef needed seasoning. They charge for water ?! Who charges for water . The servers didn't come around to check on us at all . I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"So a new place to try, Salvadoran food.  First time to try it and what the heck is a \"Pupusas\" anyway?  I have seen these little restaurants all over town, small little places, and wonder what their menu has on it that makes it so popular.    My husband, the real foodie in the family, said he'd read some good reviews and we should try it.  So we stopped in and found a empty place.  Were we early for dinner, or was this a warning sign?  I soon found out that it was just an early dinner that found the place so empty.     So I selected something that at least sounded like something you'd find in a Mexican place, the Chile rellano.  It was mild and had rather ordinary flavor, so it wasn't a big hit.  My husband got the pork and cheese Pupusas, which turned out to be a thick \"tortilla\" like flat bread.  It  know that it was very in expensive, and I am sure we'd try it again.  Might have to study the menu a little be harder though.  Service good, clean place, staff friendly."}
{"text":"Food was really good.  Prices were a little high.  I did not like that they charged an additional .99 to process Credit Card transactions."}
{"text":"Home made popusas!!!...love there fresh made popusas not your frozen food, it's very small place  it makes me feel at home the lady in the back of the kitchen makes them fresh to order,u can still hear her making them love there red salsa...price it's great if you oder 12 or more there only a dollar,I heard there torts are bomb I come here all the time..."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the service is horrible... only a couple of waiters with nice attitudes lol if you're starving don't go in they take long to bring the food."}
{"text":"I called ahead to place an order because I came while on my lunch break. I am now sitting here an hour later, still waiting on my food. Do NOT come here if you do not plan on eating in."}
{"text":"I am always up for finding new places to eat. This time it was Latin flavor I was craving. Las Pupusas was what I found close by to me.  Pupusas is where it's at! I mean if it's the name of the place then it must be good. I am a fan of the cheese and chicken Pupusas and the pork and bean one. Their enchiladas and burritos are also good too. I like watching them make the food. I also enjoyed watching Spanish music videos. They played an old Ricky martin song I hadn't heard in forever!  A little tip is they can get super busy. They have their lunch crowd and dinner crowd. I usually try to sneak in between to avoid the wait. I give props to the cooks back there trying to keep up with all the orders.  I give 3 stars for good service and food."}
{"text":"Yeah I came back. I ordered the same thing I always do, Calamari and two pupusas. Very cheap and with drink.   But I left the tips in cash on the table, always do always have. The next day I checked the bank account and there was an extra charge. I don't want to accuse but somebody added extra tips to the receipt. Not cool. That's practically stealing because I am sure I left tips on the table, cash. That doesnt mean I wont come back but I either write the tip on the receipt or cross that part out.   I wasn't going to go back to claim that money back I know they are entitled to tips but they should consider they already received them. And legally you don't HAVE to tip. But I do, its classy to do so. Stealing or adding to the charge is not.  This is for everyone else, be careful with this."}
{"text":"Overall the food wasn't good at all. Hygiene in restroom v ey bad, and the atmosphere is sad."}
{"text":"My first time trying salvadorian food. Pupusas were very good, tasted like something between a corn and flour spongy bread with cheese in it.  I actually ended up having the carne asada burrito which was pretty good.  Also my friend ordered this dessert (forget the name) that's pretty much like donuts and you dip it in honey before you eat it. Prices are average. Service was friendly. I have to say that the waitresses don't speak English well so if you have any special requests it may not cross the language barrier.  All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"One of the things I appreciate about LV is the diversity of \"Hispanic\" foods. I could eat tacos everyday but it's nice to crunch an Arepa or pupusa every now and then as well."}
{"text":"I had my first pupusas here that  I've ever had after reading numerous great things from fellow yelpers.  Wow, it's a bit different, and very good.  It's served with a side of their seasoned homemade shredded cabbage salad. I am going to go back again and try more things from their menu.   On top of it all you can watch the cook make the pupusas by hand and grill it, cool thing for first timers!  We had 4 pupusas 2 drinks for only 10 bucks and change. My revueltos pupusas was only $1.75 each, two of them and you'll be full.  They also ahave a mexican menu there if you don't feel like Salvadoran food.  The place gets fairly crowded during lunch and they haven't really been at this location very long. I'm thankful a Salvadoran place exists in N. LV. and you should be too!  Good for them, good for us.... give this place a whirl."}
{"text":"I have heard about these pupusas - so I thought I would try it out.  This place has about 60 tables looks like a quick service place but they do have a waitress.  The waitress explained what a pupusas is so I tried 3 different kinds; pork, chicken, and I think a cheese.  They are basically a thick soft corn tortilla stuffed mostly with cheese.  They give you a side of fresh shredded cabbage salad.  They were pretty tasty.  What I liked most was the cheese oozed out and was grilled so it had that crispy tangy chewy goodness.  I don't know what that is called - but I like it!  I think they would be good with some sauce on them - but they were still very tasty.  The service was very good, too."}
{"text":"I wondered how they get the meat inside the Pupusa... until I went to this place.  They have a window to look inside the kitchen and watch the lady make the pupusas.  I was staring in amazement as she made those little pockets of tortilla goodness.  There were a few moments where I gazed into her eyes and expressed my fondness of how she so lovingly hand crafted the pupusas.  That day I fell in love with the pupusa maker...  but I digress...  This place looks like a fast food place inside - not too much atmosphere.  Good service except for the fact that I do not speak spanish, but I do pretty good with pointing at the pictures on the menu and smiling.   The food... The pupusas are where it's at.  The rest of the food was just average Mexican food.  I have had pupusas at other places, but these were better.  They seemed to be bigger and had more filling.    I saw a guy eating what looked like chicharones... I am looking for those on the menu next time - they looked so good.  This place is way cheap too.  You can get a lot of food here for your money!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints about the food, I had been going there for the past 3 years, but I am NOT going back period, I was having breakfast this morning and the waitress started laughing at an old lady that clearly had mental problems, she ordered and pay for her food, both waitresses keep laughing at the old lady, I gave 5 cents tip and I was generous because their service was terrible! I hope the owner read this and put those girls out of work because that's discrimination! For Hispanic people like that all of us we lose. Shame on them!"}
{"text":"I love their food here is great I would have given them more than 3 stars but my cons are that the inside could be alot better needs a makeover & some of the tables are wobbly & the chairs could be more comfortable other than that I love this place for their food"}
{"text":"Terrific pupusas. Cortido was just right.   Broad menu.    Great waitstaff.    Huge Salvadoran  beer.     Carne asada plate with blots of rice and beans and salad.  Highly recommended for a quick and satisfying meal.  Thanks Yelpers!"}
{"text":"The place was a mess from beginning to end, plates on almost every table that was not being used. The host and waiter lacked attending. The food was ok. I gave this place a second try and i waited 1 hour. Never will i go back again"}
{"text":"Yum the Mexican Ladies in my office introduced me to Pupusas today and i am a fan! i had the mixed Pupusas and the coleslaw and hot sauce was super yummy but also really greasy. the good kind of greasey.And for $1.75 a piece you cant beat it! Definatly going to be back soon"}
{"text":"Good pupusas, not going to say the best but really good food and a quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best place for pupusas in Vegas. Staff not very friendly though. I was placing an order over the phone, the lady was yawning as I was speaking. For some reason the other locations are not as good as this one."}
{"text":"Love pupusas great is soo close to my place. We r going all the time, place an order by phone is saving u a lot of time waiting. ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Pupusas are amazing.  Best in town. The ladies are servsafe certified which means they know the health code. Very clean."}
{"text":"Love the pupusas.   Good seven seas soup.  Plantains were greasy.   Rice and beans could be better.  Like the bistec.  Overall food was too salty.  Stick w/the small plates.  Good tamales, cole slaw and yucca.  Central American food not as good as Mexican.  Service is friendly but slow.  Casual atmosphere w/kids fighting over vending machines."}
{"text":"Omg so good!!  Kind of a far drive but beyond worth it. And luckily there are locations closer to me.   First time having pupusas and came with my Salvadorian friend for an authentic experience ;)  Ordered pupusas to start. So cheesy and hot and good and only 1.95 each. The marinated cabbage on the side so flavorful with some hot sauce.   I ordered a shrimp dish- camarones rancheros- shrimp and tomatoes with beans and rice and a salad. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing. I love the beans. The next day I finished it and soaked up some of the sauce with my leftover pupusas. Mmmmmmmmm  My friend had the corn tamales which comes with beans and sour cream and I would definitely order those next time. For dessert we ordered empanadas De plantano con leche. Little fried plantains filled with sweet milk. Pretty tasty but probably would pass next time.   I read people giving this place 2 stars based on service or friendliness. We had a great experience but I def don't think this is the place u would come to get great service. You come for the food. Which is delicious."}
{"text":"It was our first time, place was very busy. We had Pupusas, Yucca, and Empanadas. Everything was delicious. For only having three employees working they managed everything well."}
{"text":"Best Pupusas in Vegas!! Coming here since I was a little girl, and it is seriously so delicious. I love the atmosphere, the people and above all else - their food. Now I just want some yucca!"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you are not in a hurry food takes a bit but it's so worth it and much better than getting something already pre-made the pricing is reasonable and the location is clean just like all the other locations they have"}
{"text":"One star is due to the Waitress from HELL! This is my second time eating there.  The first time I ate there Jacqueline the waitress was Bitchy but, this time she was a Royal Bitch!! When she was on break, a co-worker took our order. I asked him for Yuca Fries a la cart. He said OK that will be $2.50. We waited 20 minutes then Jacqueline brought the Pork combo plate with Yuca fries. I told her that's not what I ordered. She replied in a very rude manner and said \"Do you want it or not?\" Because that is the only way I could get the Yuca fries. I said go get the gentleman that took my order. She replied \"I am the waitress, \"do you want it or not\".  I asked to speak to the manager, then she brings out a cook from the back that does not speak English. Then I requested the gentleman that took my order. I asked if he would translate to the so called \"Manager\" which I don't believe she really was the manager, and he did. The Manager said \"OK\" she was going to honor that order. Well, Jacqueline took the Manager in the back and  manipulated the outcome of her decision. Jacqueline came back to me to say the same thing. \"Do you want it or not\" and would not honor my order. Any who, needless to say, I refuse the pork combo plate. It was amazing to me that Jacqueline went out of her way to create a bad experience rather than defusing the situation.  This waitress has the worse people skill or customer service I have ever encountered from a waitress. Rude beyond belief. I told her I was going to give her a bad Yelp review and she said in her sassy voice, go right ahead.  I wonder how the owner feels about her horrible attitude and tarnishing the reputation of their restaurant? I would love to hear from the owners. I would never let someone like her work for me!! BAD FOR BUSINESS."}
{"text":"Let me just start this by saying that I love me some Salvadorean food. I had the chicken and cheese and zucchini and cheese pupusas. The slaw was vinegary with a bit of heat, just as it should be and the salsa gave a nice cooling effect. Loved the food. Also ordered plantains which weren't the best I'd ever had but were still good. They could have been blotted with a whole roll of paper towels to sop up the grease. My mother had pupusas as well and loved them. My father had a chicken, peppers, and rice dish and liked that. All in all, good food. The biggest issue was the wait. We had multiple tables around us order, recieve their food, and leave before we were even served. Then when the food actually came out my mom and dad got their food and they brought out the plantains for the table but then my plate failed to come out for another five minutes and I actually had to ask the server for my food, again, just to get my plate. Thankfully the food wasn't cold when it arrived."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here. The pupusas are worth the wait. We end up ordering more to take home.  Service isn't that bad, the pupusas make up for everything."}
{"text":"No sirven la comida aqui las pupusas savor a agua con tortilla. El curtido nada de savor puro repollo con agua. La salsa peor. No bueno no recomiendo este lugar.  No Se ni como explicar lo feo que esta aqui. Tenia. Niños corriendo gritando y no les design nada. Eww  food gross I don't recommend this place for nothing."}
{"text":"The food was great.but the service  was horrible,i waited 20 minutes  to get a refill and that's because  i had to get up and ask for it. Wont be going back"}
{"text":"The pupusas are great. They're handmade and hot and delicious. Order them by phone and pick them up 20 minutes later."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here on a whim and found a gem in the rough. My wife had the spicy shrimp (extra spicy) and I had the lengua ranchera (tongue). The shrimp was actually spicy and the flavor was great. The lengua was super tender and tasty. We also had a variety of the papusas all of them were great but the herb and cheese is fantastic. The service was great and our waitress, a friendly young lady was happy to answer our questions and was very attentive. The prices were fantastic and we will be returning in the near future for more.  Bravo!!"}
{"text":"I like pupusas because they're tasty and cheap! The pupusas here meet both those requirements so I'll definitely be back and hopefully sample some of the other offerings. They seemed to be relatively busy for a Friday before noon when I stopped in so it seems popular. The service was nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Cant say enough about this place: excellent food, great menu selections, and best of all, awesome service. The waitresses are very attentive and sweet. Don't go without tasting the flan. My girlfriend's favorite."}
{"text":"Food is delish  Pupusa Pork, Beans & Rice (delish)  Pork tamale (lots of flavor and very moist)  Service: 12p rush hour Quick 10min wait   The apple drink is yummy   Typical salvadoreño restaurant. Don't expect 5 stars   Clean, friendly staff, parking, air conditioning   Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and fair priced. They have very good Pupusas and you can always just call ahead of time and do a carry out order. The staff is always friendly and the food is always so good!!!"}
{"text":"We found this place has 5 other restaurants in vegas n I must say it's pretty good the prices are reasonable u get more for ur dollar.  The customer service was very friendly . I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in town for some good salvi food."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall if you order the right stuff and have lots of time to kill.  Pupusas = awesome.  Wait time if you order in advance and try to do takeout = less great.  Net result seems to be good enough that I find myself here more often than not waiting for takeout.  I especially love their zucchini and cheese pupusa."}
{"text":"Haha, I never thought I'd say this, but I've had better in Wichita.  The pupusas here are a little bland, though the variations were interesting.  They did not have much crust on them.  The crudito was not pickled long enough and also bland.  We also had the corn tamales with crema and frijole.  One tamale was fried and the other was boiled.  I've never had them fried before; my husband prefers it this way.  I prefer it boiled since it's creamier.  Service was indifferent but quick.  Prices were cheap.  Average all around, so it's unlikely that I'll return."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, I'm talking near food coma worthy! But...the service is terrible! We watched many people walk out just because no one came to serve them. We weren't greeted and sat for nearly ten minutes before someone came to take our order. I guess you can order up front but then why have a waitress and a restaurant atmosphere? We waited at our table for a bill and it never came after almost 15 minutes so when we walked up front to pay and the waitress asked if we wanted to order. When we told her about the service she said \"I don't know I just got here\" which was a lie because she had been there the entire time we were. One waitress for a whole restaurant? That's terrible!! Like I said, fantastic food but you can find just as good of food at plenty of other places that have better service by far."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading another review.  Placed a to go order of 2 pupusas revueltas.  Got home, 7 minutes later and they were still piping hot!  Tasted just as I expected.  Service was fast.  Restaurant was clean.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Service is horrible, 20 minutes before anyone came to our table to take drinks order.... pupusas are good but the shrimp & octopus cocktail was nasty.... hope service gets better most people like me will never give them a second opportunity."}
{"text":"La verdad yo soy cliente de a qui de las popusas como por 11 años y la verdad no tienen personal hoy es domingo el restaurant casi lleno y solo 2 meseras y eln la cosina solo c miran 2 cosineras ya tenemos 1 hora q ordenamos y a un no a llegado nuestra comoda la verdad q si esta rrico pero tambien tomen  conciencia no es justo"}
{"text":"Having this place right around the corner from my house is both a pro and a con. The pupusas always hit the spot without hitting my wallet too badly. I've tried pretty much all their pupusas and I am never disappointed. I love that they make it fresh once you order it, which means it does take a while but I'll accept the wait because I know the finished product will make my tummy happy. Their service is good. This place is definitely my only go to spot for pupusas!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service isn't worth it. I would say unless you're spanish speaking... this place isn't where you want to go; ESPECIALLY when you're hungry and or diabetic and it's been hours since you last ate/drank.   the girl who took our order didn't speak any english, i mean NONE. i understand its an el salvadorian place and I'm perfectly accepting of the fact that english may be a 2nd language but to speak zero english is rough for the customer.   she stood at our table and didn't say anything, she just stared at us. then she asked me if i spoke spanish, which i don't cause i'm Filipino not Latin, I told her no, then gave her my order.    I wanted 2 papusas and a coke, i said it slow (without being rude) and i even pointed at the picture; again she asked me if i spoke spanish, still no. Then my boyfriend said his order: carnitas burrito... she looked at me and said \"que\" - so i repeated it exactly a little bit slower this time \"carrrrr-niitas burrito\"  we got our order: my bf got his burrito, i got 1 papusa. nothing to drink. as which point i repeated, i wanted 1 coke and 1 more papusa. she smiled and nodded. still, I got nothing. she stared at me from across the room and every time i looked up to see if she was going to bring me a coke, she looked down at the floor. no coke ever came and that 2nd papusa -- forget about it.   we were one of 3 tables occupied... so it wasn't busy. it wasn't loud, it wasn't anything... there was no excuse for the horrible service. 'Coke' as a brand is thee most popular product in the galaxy...  there should have been no reason why she shouldn't understand that when i said coke, it meant, please bring me one, not, i just like to say the word. To top it off, I'm diabetic so by this point it had been 8 hours since the last time i had anything to drink or eat so al i really needed the sugar, i was starting to shake and feel faint.   i understand that not everyone speaks english but if you're going to hire people to take orders for your restaurant, that person should really have a basic understanding of the language or at least some sense to put two and two together."}
{"text":"Ok, so the wait was long.  But that's my only complaint and i forgot all about it once I took my first bite into my papusa.  I came solo and have never had one so like a true gringo, I Googled \"how to eat papusa.\" Many suggestions and decided to dump the cabbage on top and squirt the homemade hot sauce all over.  Then BAM...where have been all my life?!  Crispy, soft, salty, gooey, sweet, spicy, and every adjective in between!  I want another but would never finish the Luenga Rancheras staring me down. You didn't think a gringo would order that did ya? Lengua was tender, tasty, and juicy...great choice!  Especially when accompanied by their thick hand pressed tortillas and addictive rice and beans!  Man, what a nice find...if you haven't been here, get here.  Look passed the shady location and tacky ambiance, and enjoy something new!"}
