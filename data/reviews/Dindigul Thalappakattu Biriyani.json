{"text":"Dindigul Thalappakattu Biriyani has a well deserved review in the Toronto Globe and Mail as the best Biriyani in Toronto.  (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/dindigul-thalappakattu-biriyani-the-best-biryani-in-toronto/article23553927/)!!!

Chef Anbu Panbarasan makes just one thing.  As Curly in City Slickers said, \"the one thing!!\" - small grain rice Biriyani

Biriyani is widely served as a special occasion dish from the Middle East to India.

South Indian Biriyani, specifically Tamil heartland Biriyani, is different.  It is slightly tangy and spicy and not oily or dry with separate grains of rice preferred by some.

First it is moist.
Second the rice is NOT Basmati but a short grain rice known as Seeraga Samba!
Third the spice includes a rare herb (if you will) is Rambe.  This leaf is rich in aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline - that gives Basmati its flavor. But this leaf is also an antispasmodic.  So gorging the delicious Dindigul Thalappakattu style Biriyani feels lighter on the gut!  You will not need the antacids,and water needed to keep other Biriyanis down!!

You can expect the simple place to be crowded.  There may be a wait since the Biriyani is cooked on site and a batch may be in prep when you order.  The unique spice mix, mutton or the chicken is cooked slowly with the rice. The Chef Anbu adds ingredients by hand at the right time to cook them in sequence.  The overall product is ready to serve steaming hot.  It is slightly tangy and quite mild for the indian palate.  Comes with a tandoori chicken leg piece, a  boiled egg, and a thick raitha!!!

The cardamom tea is to die for!!

IF you want a unique, authentic Biriyani - you want to go to this place.  The best in Toronto.

Service and ambience: The place is still at the old location of Joe's bar.  The place is small.  The chef does all the cooking.  He has one person the help.  The service is personal, courteous but limited by the size of the place.

NO BIG SIGNS OUTSIDE - A temp banner announces the place,  No ad.

He does one thing.  Makes great Biriyani.  If you like his style of this dish please get the word out!!

Try it, when you are seeking something different from all the Basmati Biriyanis in Toronto......"}
{"text":"Not the same as the original chain of the same name. We thought it was the original, did the mistake of not seeing prior yelp reviews and drove an hour to get there. Biriyani barely tasted like biriyani. Fish 65 was ok but overall a bad experience, especially when the name is a bait and switch. Should be 1-star but one extra star for the price. Food is really cheap and customer service was decent but would rather pay extra and get better tasting biriyani."}
{"text":"I can understand why the globe and mail review was an article and not an actual poll. The BEST...like the numero uno?..El Jefe of all biryani's in the GTA! ???

come on fam...no way. Is it unique and tasty- I agree. Not the best!

First of all the service is slow as it seemed like there was only 1 person who is working there (both cook and server). It took quite some time for me to get the biryani. It seems like the biryani is pre-cooked and every variation of the biryani has the same rice base and then gets a topping you ordered (e.g- Chicken, Chicken 65 , Mutton, Cauliflower). Which is kind of like a cheat code to complete a meal that is supposed to be the best.

Even Dum Pukth or Marigold take the time to create a biryani from scratch and then put the bread crust on top which is slow cooked. Dindigul located in Markham is around the vicinity of lots of Biryani houses which are distinctive to their sub-culture.

Suvaiyakam makes a very similar south indian tamil styled biryani with a much more generous portion (both meat and rice) for a lot cheaper price and it is walking distance away.

If you are interested in the more northern style biryani. The crescent also sells biryani for a lot cheaper and with a much more technical pakistani style

It was good...far from the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Same comment as someone from two years ago... Which means someone's gotta start reading their reviews and making some changes here.  This isn't biryani.  It's spicy rice.  And it would be closer to biryani if there was a bit more than just rice, but there isn't.  The lack of meat is really a bit crazy ... chicken biriyani needs to have some more meat in there.  Mutton biriyani needs to have some more mutton in there.  I realy like the concept here -- a simple menu that's got biriyani and that's about it.  But if you're specializing in biriyani, and the Globe and Mail is writing a review about you, you're going to have people coming to the restaurant.  Step up your game dude. I don't know where profit margins lie and if that's a problem, but throw in some more meat and live up to the name, baby!"}
{"text":"Fake Biryani!! They have \"biryani rice\" to which they add the meat. That's not the way Biryani is made! Nowhere close to Dindigul Biryani taste! Never going back, waste of money and time!"}
{"text":"Went after reading the reviews and the article on Globe and Mail. Highly disappointed, since I  went there on my birthday. Biryani is my favourite food and it's so integral part of our cuisine. First of all, what this restaurant serves is not Biryani at all. It's some sort of spicy rice. It's an insult to call these spicy rice Biryani.  I'm giving it one star since it's such a misrepresentation of Biryani. You can get 100x better Biryani with 2x quantity both rice and meat from any decent south Asian food joint. Save your money and disappointment"}
{"text":"No good.  Didn't even have a choice when I went. Only chicken was available.  Twice at the old location and now here once hoping to be satisfied, but never again."}
{"text":"The worst biryani I have ever had! A few months ago after hearing some reviews from people I know stating that this is the best South Indian biryani, I drove to Scarborough from Etobicoke to try this place. I lived in South India so I know my South Indian food. This was the WORST biryani I have ever had. I have never made biryani but I am pretty sure that I can make better biryani. It was so bland. I will never go back."}
{"text":"It is located in a plaza at finch East, West of Kennedy rd. Small place with simple menu. Two types of Briyani and few drinks options. I opted for takeout. One mutton and one chicken. Both costing 20 dollars in total. They have spiced it medium. Very flavorful. Both came with boiled egg and one chicken drumstick(tandoori). Briyani is mostly rice. Very little meat, especially the mutton one. Disappointed with the price to amount of meat. It is definitely worth to try for the flavor, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place. Was extremely hungry. My friend and I drove 45 to get to this place to try their biriyani. When I walked in to the place, it did not please me. It was messy and looked filthy. Old carpets and dirt everywhere.  I went to order and was told the biriyani was sold out! It was 3pm. The women in the front told us that she had not expected customers that day but they did and the food ran out. I was told to come back at 5pm when it will be ready again. WTF! What kind of a restaurant are you guys running. They didn't have anything available except pop. My friend and I decided to go to Silvers poon and buy us food there."}
