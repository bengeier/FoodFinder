{"text":"Red house works in a pinch, and may be better than the four dishes I ordered. The salt and pepper chicken had a light battered crust, the chow mein noodles are vermicelli. Not that salty or greasy. The opportunivore appreciated it on a cold night, but more reviews may be appreciated. I would like to know what dishes the regular customers recommend."}
{"text":"Have you noticed that every small town in the prairies has a restaurant on main street (usally called Club Cafe or something like that) and serves \"Chinese & Western Cuisine\"?  And that the menu is almost identical in all of these places?     Well you don't have to drive to Stettler any more we now have one right here in the big city.  On the down side, it is a sad replacement for La Luna Rosa, whose location is now Red House.   A restaurant that I frequented, it was Italian to a fault, with white table clothes and lovely daily specials.....   Anyway Red House is nothing like that, very basic, no frills, and nothing in any way exotic on the menu.    Then there's this piped in funeral home music that plays in the background, what's with that? Perhaps for the passing of Luna Rosa.  On the up side.  They serve breakfast  and you can actually walk in and get a seat!!   I don't know why its so hard to get in to a breakfast place in this town, especially late mornings on weekends, but it is.  I've only had the breakfasts here and if you have anything in mind beyond traditional bacon and eggs fare, this isn't the place.   But I did look and they indeed have the full \"Chinese and Western cuisine\"  menu.  3 stars  for the breakfast factor, otherwise 2"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Chinese food in the city. Maybe we didn't order right. Maybe only the \"actual\" Chinese dishes are good, because one thing is for sure: If you are looking for Ginger Beef, STEER CLEAR. It seems, at some point, they must have changed their name, because this location and phone number is under the name of another restaurant on Yelp (South Silk Road - http://www.yelp.ca/biz/south-silk-road-chinese-restaurant-calgary) so I am posting this review twice.  The staff seemed friendly, but it was the basically inedible quality of the food that lands this restaurant on the bottom of the list.  I have never had Ginger Beef taste so bad. Not even from a mall. The meat was unbelievably tough (it actually seemed like WAY over-cooked pork), the \"fried\" outside was mushy and disgusting, and the flavour was completely flat. All around, just BAD.  It would take a lot to get me to come back here. Once was more than enough."}
