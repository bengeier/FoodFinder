{"text":"This is, hands down, the best Indian restaurant in Madison. It's also one of the rare places where one can find authentic Kerala cuisine in the US - they have a special section of the menu for those items, and the friendly staff are happy to make recommendations. They do excellent versions of South Indian vegetarian staples, such as masala dosa, etc., and have a good number of vegan options. If you're looking for something other than standard Indian-American restaurant fare, this is the place to go - definitely one of Madison's culinary hidden gems."}
{"text":"this place is absolutely garbage. awful compressed seating. terrible service. the owner had the nerve to shout at a friend. no food at buffet. yes seriously no food at wednesday buffet. and when the food came it tasted awful don't your time head to any other indian restaurant at and you'll get your monies worth!"}
{"text":"Dosa Buffet service is horrible. Not enough food was available for the buffet service and the refilling time was beyond 30 mins, so we were basically hanging for the food to come out for most of our dinner time there. No apologies or explanation from the Manager, will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Got paneer butter masala, which was very well done and also recommend their mirchi bajji and dahi vada. they added spices in the dahi vada and added a south indian twist, so it was good. the papdi chat seemed a bit dry, so would pass on that next time. service was a bit slow (docked a star) but we went near closing time for lunch (2:30 pm), so perhaps that would explain it. The head chef is a really nice guy, he's smiling and always comes by to make sure you like the food. I would come back to check out the other south indian foods this place has"}
{"text":"This is a very overrated place. Really regret driving so far to eat there. We should have guessed that it won't be any good seeing very few customers on a Sunday evening.  Service was really poor. Especially the lady who served us didn't smile even once and was very cold. It felt like it was too much for her to serve us, muttering under her breath and giving retorts to whatever request we were making.  Food itself was nothing to write home about. Having lived in Chennai for 6 years, we know our South Indian cuisine. Sambar was nothing but daal; no spices not even hot. Dosa filling was unevenly seasoned. Coconut chutney was stale. Dosa itself was served cold.  Paneer Tikka masala kathi roll that we ordered was a joke. A meagre 4 inches wrap, very dry inside. Paneer pieces were just sauteed; no Tikka masala, seasoning.  The only reason I am giving a two star is because of the person who greeted us, took our order and served us water. He was very welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian restaurant. The Chicken Ghee was delicious, the meat was so tender.   The Chicken Tika my husband ordered had a great flavor. I will definitely be a regular customer. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very good recipes and execution under the new ownership. Two dishes stood out for me: the paneer pakoda appetizer was a delicious cheese with light, tasty coating. The chicken tikka (marinaded and baked chunks of chicken, served on a sizzling platter with onions) was the tastiest, juiciest chicken that I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"I went to their Wednesday buffet - Dosa buffet so this review is totally based on that.   On paper the concept of unlimited dosas sounded great so i told all my friends about it.   All dosas we tried were below average. Cook needs to go back to India and eat these dosas in some good restaurants to know how things are done.   If you think this review is harsh please check the pictures I uploaded so that you can judge them.   Paneer burji dosa - It had little bit of shredded paneer inside regular dosa. It was awful but still better than other dosas mentioned below.   Chinese dosa - this was big joke. it had extremely tiny amount of something stir fried inside it. I couldn't tell what it was. Dear cook please go to any chowpaty and taste Chinese dosa we get on streets of India.  Chaat dosa was disgraceful. Cook had sprinkled small amount of mdh chaat masala inside. I could barely taste it. Why did you even put it on menu?  Chocolate dosa - cook had poured chocolate syrup- probably hershey's syrup all over it to call it chocolate dosa.   They probably made cost effective version of these flavors for buffet but the plan failed miserably.   Rest of the buffet hardly had anything. Idly, vada were good but Sambar and chutney were below average."}
{"text":"Very good food.  The service is very slow even though the servers are pleasant.   I had to yell at them at the end since I had to wait for the take out for 30 mts after dining inside and paying the check.  So expect delays.  But still I am giving them 5 star since it was good Kerala food"}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious South Indian specialities and great service make Thulasi a welcome addition to the west side. The food is truly, homestyle Indian cooking and their extensive menu has so many options for vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores alike. The goat biryani, dal tadka and Kerala fish curry are a few of my favorites. I've gotten take out from Thulasi and have also eaten in (their dining room was recently renovated) and have found the food fresh, flavorful and consistent. I'll definitely be back (hopefully soon)!"}
{"text":"Hands-down this is the best Indian food I've had since leaving Los Angeles. The aromatic seasoning and the high-quality ingredients are a welcome change in this town. The quality of the lamb was outstanding. And the best part was the lovely, cheerful new owner who was delightful and refreshingly outgoing!"}
{"text":"Look elsewhere for good Indian food and way better service. Dhaba close by is leagues better.  I arrived at 6:30 to pick up my to go order, and stood waiting at the front desk for almost 10 minutes before even being greeted by someone. The place was mostly empty, with only one table occupied, so it wasn't due to a crowd that initial service was so delayed. While waiting there, I saw a bag of to go food sitting on a nearby table, with food containers inside the bad toppled over sideways. I said to myself, hopefully that's not my food. Sure enough, that was my food. I was finally greeted and got my order and paid (somewhat pricey as well, above average for Indian food in the area).  Now, the actual food - terrible. Not authentic (I'm indian), lacking flavor, and not cooked well at all. I had an order of butter chicken and an order of saag paneer. The spinach in the saag wasn't even blended or cooked all the way, and was bland, lacking any flavor, spice, or salt. Absolutely horrendous.  The butter chicken was a solid 3/10, but the quantity was horrid (see pictures). The container was 1/3 empty, when it is usually full at other indian restaurants in the area. This is UNACCEPTABLE for a $15 dish. Taste-wise, it could have used a little more salt and a little bit more flavor (just felt like I was eating a creamy bland tomato soup).  Overall, look elsewhere for Indian food. There are far better options out there."}
{"text":"The food is OK if you're looking to try something different but sometimes it's very dry. I've only been there for lunch and use to go there when it was $8... then it went to $10. The last and final lunch I had was over $12 with only water for my beverage. I had no warning the price went up to a ridiculous rate. No thanks, I won't be back. The price is not worth the taste experience..."}
{"text":"I was driving down junction road when I saw a small sign by a flower pot for this restaurant so decided to try it for dinner thinking it is a new restaurant.   We were the first customer that evening. Very quiet place since it was Saturday and offices around were probably closed. The wait person was new, started a week ago. When I inquired about the type of Indian cuisine (north or south) she had to ask the chef out. :-)  It is a South Indian cuisine. Young chef and it is under a new management. It isn't A new restaurant. Thulasi took over the location from Minerva Indian cuisine and kept their wifi SSID.   Food was flavorful, environment was clean. Check out my photos for what we ordered. In addition to the dishes, I tried the masala tea. Tea was lukewarm most likely as a result if pouring back and forth to get some froth. I'm just trying to make excuse for warm tea.   Fir a few minutes while we were there the music came on over the speakers. It was loud but pleasant and then it was shut off.   Only one other family came for dinner and chef was spending time teaching the new wait staff about the various dishes so that good.   Overall, a decent Indian restaurant with authentic Indian dishes. I would return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Okay:  So I came back for dinner and difference was night and day! (Get it... its night now.)  The place, which is often loud and crowded during lunch, was transformed, even intimate.  Their plating was similarly careful, and their staff gracious and attentive.    Where the lunch seemed phoned in, the dinner was truly well composed and delicious.  I was especially pleased by the technique: the manchurian cauliflower managed to be saucy and crisp, the chicken 65 crispy yet the meat was still moist, the samosa chat was complex yet comforting.  The moment the main course came out I overwelhmed by the fragrance of curry and ginger.  The paneer was the best, I repeat the best, I have had in town.     They brought son free mango icecream!  I'm just happy I have them a second shot... I will be back.... just maybe after work next time.   Lunch review: So,  This place is next to my office.  Have eaten here twice and likely will again due convenience... having said that their lpunch buffet is fairly scant compared to (literally all) the other indian places I frequent in town.  More than that there normally 2 or less staff members on during lunch... and it's really a struggle to even get a cup of tea.    On the other hand the food is edible and it's extremely convienant.  So... it's likely that I'll be back and I'd love to be impressed and to update my review."}
{"text":"Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani is my favorite. I am yet to try their new menu. I see some malabar entries. Hope they will be good too."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much when I chose to come here. I used to come here when it was a different Indian restaurant.  Right when we walked in, the decor and cleanliness was very inviting.   The waiter was very attentive. He seated us right away. We had paneer tikka roll and papri chat to begin with. The paneer tikka roll came with a delicious green sauce- I would give 10/10 for the sauce, the roll on the other hand was wrapped in a package tortilla and the filling wasn't as great. The papri chat cane out quite dry but I must say, the owner was attentive enough to rectify our chat with more sauce. That was awesome service.   We also had masala dosa and chole batura. Both were splendid. We coconut chutney and the Sambar with the dosa was very authentic. The chole bhatura was awesome. Right kind of spice and the bread was crisp and tasty. We ended up ordering another batura to go.  We ended our meal with madras coffee which I would recommend to anyone coming here. It had the filter coffee taste I also look forward to in madras coffee. For me- that was the highlight of my meal. Must visit. A very well run restaurant I must say!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent but they're a bit understaffed. The server is also the chef (not permanently probably) and service is slow. Decor is lacking, they should dim the lights/play music/etc. to make it more inviting. But food was very good (spicy, authentic), so will return. A few people were ordering dosas and appams (crispy rice pancakes) and both looked fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"You can't enjoy biryani with mirchi ka salan. ordered vegetable biryani, it was ok nothing fact no tofu or paneer in it."}
{"text":"Delivery review: put in my order at 4:45 after being quoted a 45-60 minute delivery period and food arrived at 7:00, which ruined our plan for the night. My \"very spicy\" order was medium intensity at best and we received basmati instead of the Kerala brown rice. Not ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I thought there was a dinner buffet, but there wasn't, so we ended up ordering off the dinner menu.  That aside, while all the food and drinks were all good, the service was extremely slow, and the portions were small.  The coconut drink was amazing, as was our vegetarian appetizer platter, but I didn't expect to wait 30 minutes for both, and then end up with tiny portions.  All-in-all, we ordered drinks, an appetizer, bread (doesn't come with meal), and 2 entries, and I was still hungry 2 hours later.  The heat levels are 1, 3, and 5, and I didn't detect any heat with 3."}
{"text":"I ordered carry out from Thulasi. I believe I had ordered through Yelp. I got there maybe 10 minutes after the time it said my order would be ready but I had to wait another 10 minutes.  I ordered the Vegetable Biryani. It was pretty good. I'm wondering if it's typical to keep the large pieces of spices in it. I won't knock them for it, since I have no idea, but I didn't particularly enjoy picking out the star anise, cloves, etc. from my biryani. I still enjoyed it though.  The garlic naan was good. Real garlic was used, yay! Though I think it would be better enjoyed dining in, since it was rather mushy by the time I got home."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Madison! Great staff, friendliest in town and great experience in a cozy and modern environment! My only fix for Indian food locally!!"}
{"text":"I'm rating a three star because I have tried only Vegetable Biryani here. It was delicious. Only thing I would recommend is to provide more \"Raita\".    This place has improved a lot under new name.   Best of luck and keep up the good work."}
