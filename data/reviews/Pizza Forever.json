{"text":"Had their Turkish Pizza and a couple plain slices and they were absolutely delicious. I finished dinner with some of their homemade baklava- I'm Turkish so I know Baklava- it was AMAZING. Very friendly customer service. Will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Ordered on my phone. Delivered sooner than I expected. 8\" hoagie was a good size for me. 6 cut small cheese pizza looked good. Grandson liked it. Driver was very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"I got a cheese pizza it was not good and the falafel salad was horrible.  The falafel tasted like old refrigerator smells.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Got a seafood pie. Delicious. Jumbo wings are nice. Plump, not over cooked. Delivery was 30 minutes early"}
{"text":"We decided to try Pizza Forever because our favorite pizza shop changed hands and has declined in quality. (previously pizza Milano in Bellevue , now Pizza Station) We ordered A standard Pepperoni and cheese pizza and some Bbq boneless wings. The delivery was pretty quick and that's where the positives stop. The boneless wings, albeit real white meat chicken that is apparently hand breaded, were overcooked, so A for effort but a C- on execution. The sauce was ok. 
The Pizza was what I would expect at a restaurant with too many items in the menu...(did I mention there are are too many items on the menu?) The crust was bland, as was the sauce and the pepperoni was sparse. 

As an amateur restaurant critic, I'd suggest trimming the menu and focusing on getting the Pizza right, I mean, it is Pizza Forever. Gyros and Mexican food on the same menu as pizza and hoagies is just confusing."}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars. It wasn't that the pizza wasn't good, but it was different. We order a pepperoni pizza and at first thought it had no sauce. So I got a new slice and peeled off the cheese and pepperoni and discovered what seemed to be a thin layer of ricotta instead of traditional red sauce. Not sure if this is their standard or maybe it was a just mixup. Will be sure to question upon a future order."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza on a Thursday night through Grub Hub. Delivery said 60-70 minutes. Driver was late getting to our apartment because he was lost. No big deal, s**t happens. Our apartment complex is confusing. The pizza was still warm once it arrived. We got an old fashion pepperoni and I loved the fact that they put the pepperoni under the cheese. The pizza was very good and the crust was soft but not doughy. I would order from them again."}
{"text":"With so many choices in our area, this \"pizza place\" has become our go to with so much more to offer than just pizza ((Although their thin crust pizza is the best!)) check out their menu-- the authentic gyro salad is so fresh & delicious. Delivery is fast-- food is always hot!"}
{"text":"I would leave less than one star if I could my friend and I ordered five or six different things none of it was edible. We both literally got physically ill from trying to eat it. Then their customer service was terrible on top of it. Told us that's how they made the food all night. Then I feel sorry for everyone else who ordered too"}
