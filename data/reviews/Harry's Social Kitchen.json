{"text":"I could actually enjoy a quiet conversation over dinner and drinks.  Great neighborhood spot.  The food was good and the service friendly. Comfortable atmosphere.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've moved to the Bathurst/St. Clair area and stumbled upon Harry's while scouring the neighbourhood for a new \"local\".  It looked intriguing, and so I ventured in to grab a late-night-bite, but the kitchen had closed at 10pm.  I think that was a Thursday or Friday, and maybe I'm a night owl, but I think a restaurant should offer even a limited late night menu?  Undaunted, I actually went back the next night, and the experience was quite favourable.  Service was great, professional and friendly but not overbearing.  The house manager came by once to check on us, which was a nice touch.  I mentioned possibly having a limited late night menu, and he sounded attentive (but we'll see!).  I went with the feature, which was seared Black Cod on a bed of fennel, with rice.  I'm not a huge fan of fennel, but this dish really worked.  The piece of cod was larger than expected, and cooked perfectly, which given how thick the cut was, I was really impressed.  I ate my entire fennel - a compliment for sure.  My girlfriend had the Woodland Mushroom Tortellini and gave it thumbs up. I had a bite, pasta was cooked nicely and sure it was pretty darn good, but at nearly $18 for non-protein pasta, it seemed a bit steep.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that the Black Cod was only about $25, especially since the server told me that it had been taken off the menu b/c it was so expensive.  I hadn't asked how much the feature was, so I began to worry I was into a $35 main.  We skipped appetizers in favour of martinis, and in lieu of dessert I had a scotch.   We left saying we'd definitely be back.  Interestingly, I ended up there a few nights later for a small social drop in for a charity I volunteer with.  They had set us up in the back room with some high top tables and a few appetizers - pizza, sliders and calamari.  Pizza was good (Fire Roasted Tomato), although by the time I got at it, it had been out a while.  The sliders though were great, I find that often sliders are overcooked (since they are so small) but these were medium well, juicy and made a great impression on me.  I would almost never order sliders, but I would certainly do so at Harry's.  The other thing that impressed me on this night was the fact that the servers dedicated to our group were so accommodating (personal bills/tabs for all 20 of us) and attentive. Sometimes servers seem annoyed by larger groups, but not this time, and it definitely solidified my good opinion of this place."}
{"text":"Don't miss this great restaurant for a good and quick lunch at Yonge and St. Clair.  The food came out fast but the flavours were there.  I'd recommend getting a seat by the fireplace."}
{"text":"We went to Harry's to catch up and watch the hockey game. Having never been there before we didn't know what the viewing was going to be like. It wasn't problem at all. They have seating in the bar where they have multiple big screen TV's and during game time they were all tuned to the game. They didn't however need to crank the sound so it was the only sound to be heard. Harry's still maintained a cool, laid back attitude where we could hear ourselves speak.  We enjoyed a few sharing plates: the Bang Bang Shrimp, Three Cheese Angus sliders, and Yam Frites. We weren't sure when we ordered if this would be enough but it was. We found the food to be well presented and yummy. IN fact the Yam Frites could be the best I've tried in the city. They weren't too fat and yammy.  To drink we had Pilsner Urquell on tap and to finish it off we had a Chivas, neat. I high recommend this velvety, smooth scotch to celebrate a special moment, like catching up with old friends or sharing a special moment.  To top this all off the bill didn't come with a sticker shock. For a few beers, scotch, and food we spent $50 each. It was well worth it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Harry's social kitchen since I live in the neighbourhood. I went there with a friend who lives in the area as well. I am glad such an establishment opened in the vicinity as it was over saturated with fake Irish pubs. The food was delicious and it seemed like they used quality ingredients as well. The staff was really friendly and amazing."}
{"text":"I work in this 'hood and I had lunch at Harry's twice this week (and a couple times in the past).  After extensive renovating, it looks totally different from Finn's ... it's a lot more upscale.  I like it.  The menu is really limited so all I've had is the burger and fries.  The burger is okay but seems like it's been cooked ahead of time and then just heated up.  One of my colleagues on Monday ordered the taco and it looked blah ... flat with not much on it.  She said it wasn't very good.  I had the same server both times this week and she was great ... helpful and friendly.  I liked it better when it was a Finn's.  The menu was more fun and the atmosphere more comfortable."}
{"text":"And so the Harry's experiment comes to a bitter end. Harry's shuttered earlier this month. Does this make it an Anti-Social Kitchen?  Poor Harry is no longer on the boat."}
