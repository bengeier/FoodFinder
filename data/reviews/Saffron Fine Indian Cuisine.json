{"text":"This was a nice gem in the suburbs. Recently reopened as Bollywood Cafe. Will give it a spin soon ... And it's closed. Come back!"}
{"text":"This delightful, seemingly authentic place has a bewilderingly large and tasty menu.  The service was extremely friendly; the atmosphere, inviting and classy yet not overly formal.

We tried the Samosas for an appetizer (delicious, with excellent dipping sauces) and the Vegetable Kurma, a wonderful mix of vegetables in a spicy, almost-cheese-like sauce.  The Naan (try Onion Naan) is delicious as well.

Portions are large (consider splitting an entre√© and an appetizer with a friend or date)."}
{"text":"CLOSED!  Now called Bollywood Cafe in same location...food is VERY good."}
