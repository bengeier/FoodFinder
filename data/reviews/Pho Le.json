{"text":"My husband and I have ordered here a few times. I enjoy their vegetable pho. I love the variety of vegetables you get and love that this is even offered as an option. Our last visit we actually dined in rather than getting a take out order. I had the Tom Yum soup with shrimp which was delicious and the chicken pad thai which was very good. Service was quick and friendly. You felt like you were a guest in their home as they brought you hot green tea when you first sit down. We will continue coming here and enjoy trying new things on their menu."}
{"text":"Not very good. The chicken satay with steamed rice was smelling strongly of fish. Maybe they used the left over oil or used a uncleaned dish after cooking fish to prepare this. Many items on menu were not available.  The chicken satay on steamed rice was very oily and the mango milk shake was a disaster..... overall bad food. But the place was neat and clean, service ok."}
{"text":"This place is super tacky , the menu is in disarray stuff crossed out with pen . The pho is poor quality , refer to my pic I posted . There's hardly any meat and what meat there is turned out dry and very poor quality . The spring rolls where good . The water had a funny taste . I was really disappointed ."}
{"text":"great pho. pad Tai is also great. my new favorite pho spot. wife likes that the vegetarian pho has lots of different vegetables."}
{"text":"Pho le has become our favorite local place for Vietnamese. It's pretty new but they do a great job with everything. The smoothies are all made with fresh fruit and vegetables and the food is equally fresh. 

The pho is amazing... Complex broth with choice cuts of meat.  We also really like the bun. They grill the meats well. 

We'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Used to be a supporter of this place in 2015 and early 2016. They used to have really unique beef broth and their fresh shrimp rolls tasted fresh and delicious then. They must have changed chef or the chef must have gotten complacent. I have given 2 chances to redeem themselves after I realized a drop in quality. My last visit was on 10/14. The shrimp roll tasted stale. In fact, I had runs in the middle of the night. Fortunately no vomiting. The bun with grilled beef tasted like what you would get from food courts. The fried chicken wings were over fried. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, friendly atmosphere. Fresh and yummy. Great veggie spring rolls. A find."}
{"text":"Pho Le is a small family restaurant just recently opened the food is amazing the service is great and the price is affordable. 
They are offering 10% off  Grand opening. 
If you're in the Clarkston area and like Viet Thai cuisine try this friendly family restaurant you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service and a small menu selection. I had to get my own chopsticks and spoon because my table didn't have any. Other than someone bringing you food, there is no service. The waitress wasn't very nice. When I walked in, I was ignored and I stood there and walked up to the waitress to get a table. It was obvious someone walked in because there were wind chimes above the door. On top of that the place was kind of small and dirty looking as well. 

Usually for pho places, I like to order bun bo hue but this place didn't have it. Nor did they have satay broth. 

I ordered a fresh spring roll with grilled beef in it. The beef was not grilled! It was dry and it was boiled beef; not grilled. They literally took beef out of the pho broth and used it to make my spring roll. 

Anyways, I'm never coming back"}
{"text":"Thought I'll check out this place for lunch since most restaurants were closed today...it was okay.  My parents had the pho noodle soup and the broth was good but I've been to other pho restaurants where a large is a large size bowl and the large was a medium here.  My dad wasn't impressed and found it lacking noodles and beef.  I had the vermicelli with grilled beef and spring rolls.  I liked my dish and would have it again.  Would I go back? Probably if I am hungry enough and don't feel like driving far for vietnamese."}
{"text":"UPDATE: September 2016

Guess who's back, back again?! 

I decided to give this place another go because I was freaking starving and I was also craving pho. Like I mentioned in my previous review, I'm not too picky about the taste of the broth so I just didn't care today! 

They got a new hostess/ waitress who is very nice and is super sweet! I love staff who are good at holding a conversation and come in to check in on how we are doing. This waitress did just that! The only downside is she is a bit slow. However, I don't think it was entirely her fault because she can only go as fast as the kitchen goes. 

I ordered a grill chicken with rice to share with my baby boy. The chicken came out fried and I kindly had to get the waitress to ask why I got a fried chicken. She asked the chef and was told that the chef didn't think it \"wasn't safe to grill the chicken because of the rain\" so she fried it instead. I have no idea what that meant.. I mean, it was raining that day but that either has nothing to do with cooking a chicken or it was so hot in the kitchen that the chicken wouldn't be as fresh... I was confused. Either way, I was super put off by the fact that basically the chicken wouldn't be good enough to eat if it was grilled. Anyway, they didn't have anything else on the menu my son likes to eat (he only eats rice and chicken at pho restaurants) so he basically only had rice and had to wait until we got home to eat more food. This isn't the first time the kitchen has changed an order on us and just sent something else out instead. They really shouldn't do that lol or at least let me know so I can confirm that I am okay with the change. 

We ordered mango and avocado milkshakes that took almost 30 minutes to be ready. On top of this, the cup wasn't even filled the whole way! 

I also ordered a large P3 (beef and tendon). The bowl is quite large but I got a small amount of noodles and two small pieces of tendon. 

Anyway, I'm so done with this place so it's a 1 star from me now. Not even the customer service can save it :( and that's really too bad because this area needs a really good pho place that serves good, quality food (with big portions) and has good service. 


May 2016: So I've been meaning to write a review for this place because my husband and I were torn between a one and a four star rating. He's very particular about the broth tasting juuuust right, whereas I don't quite have the taste buds to really differentiate a good broth from a bad broth (unless it's super fatty, then I can really tell). When this restaurant first opened, the owner was there and she was super nice and welcoming. The decor is pretty standard for a Vietnamese pho establishment and it's clean. 

So far, we've gone three times and this place is not consistent with the taste in its broth or meat. 1/3 times the broth tasted good; even my husband said he liked it! The two other times, not so much and the rare beef was not even rare... It also tasted different than the other pho places we've been to- rubbery and a bit tough. This most recent time we went, I ordered P3 (rare beef and tendon) but didn't get any tendon in my soup and got tripe instead for some reason. My husband made a comment about his soup because the meat was cooked through and the taste seemed different so I did not mention my wrong order until the end of our visit. The hostess/waitress told the chef (I assume she is the chef) but there wasn't really any assurance of it not happening again or any follow up statement after that.. I kind of left like, \"thanks?...\"

The shrimp rolls are consistently good. The pad Thai wasn't very flavourful- kind of bland. Also, the veggie to noodle ratio was very off so I was left with a whole bunch of veggies on my plate (mostly onion) and not feeling very full. 

The last two times we've gone the owner wasn't there and a hostess/waitress was there. I hate to say it because I really want to like this place but she always seems annoyed! I almost don't want to ask for water or anything as to avoid annoying her further. Don't get me wrong, she'll smile but it's kind of forced. I don't think we'll be coming back here just because it seems like there are too many things amiss. 

I would go with a 1/5 star because of the inconsistency and the hostess/ waitress experience but bumped it to a 2 because the owner was so nice and sometimes the broth is good!"}
{"text":"Well ...Well....Well.....
They opened a new Pho Place in my neighborhood. 
So being an honorary Elite Yelp reviewer , it is now my duty to go and test out this local establishment !
So I read some of the reviews of Pho Le , and well.....
Some were right some were wrong ! 
1st off I will not listen to another person, who's review is based off an 11 year Olds taste buds hahaa.....
But regardless let's get on with the review .
The owner or lady at the front of the establishment is VERY NICE !!! and thus is hard or what makes this review hard to write . Kindness goes a long way !
She's very pleasant and takes great pride in the appearance of the restaurant and her customers which I can tell by how she greeted guests .
Onto the restaurant , the decor is nice , place is very clean and fresh looking if that's possible . 
The food .......ok the food .... (sigh ) ......
I got a Large pho , beef and tendon .....it was the size of a small in most other places ..yes I said there large is the size of a small in most other places ...so if your hungry get an XL ..trust me ..... the broth is pretty tasty ...fairly good and fresh.
Not much meat in it as its a small bowl like I said, but the noodles were fresh and soft which made up for it .
We also got a chicken pad thai ...it was ok was a little bland missing something couldn't quite figure out what it was but was ok in the end but also we didnt finish it ...but was a decent portion /size .
As appetizers we got deep fried tofu and spring rolls 
The deep fried tofu was tough and not my fave as I love to get this app at other veitnamese places .The spring rolls were good on the other hand with a pleasant dipping sauce with fresh orange zest flavor !

So in the end ....would i come back ....maybe ..but theres 2 other places near by i would chose to go back to. But i might just give them another chance as i really liked the owner and her kindness .......
my review of the place is as follows 

DECOR / Ambiance  7.5 out of 10
Service.                        9.  Out of 10

{"text":"According to my 11-year-old daughter, \"This is the best place in the whole world and if you don't come here then you are missing a piece of your soul.\" It's a fairly new restaurant, so they don't have many reviews yet. Come and try them out. It's worth a visit. Or two. Or three . . .

The customer service is wonderful. If we lived near here, we would be regulars because we know we would always get personable, friendly, and attentive service.

This is our second visit in a week. We fully enjoyed the pork with vermicelli and a spring roll, wonton egg noodle soup (but my daughter had them swap out the egg noodles for vermicelli noodles, which they were happy to do), and crispy spring rolls. The sauce that comes with the pork and spring rolls adds just the right extra touch of flavor.They also have a nice selection of canned and bottled sodas, as well as traditional Vietnamese specialty drinks. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was our first (and probably only) visit to Pho Le. We walked into the empty restaurant at around 11:30 on a Monday morning. We found it very strange that the gentleman who was sitting at a table, jumped up and told us to sit. Then he ran outside and came back in after a few minutes with a lady who ended up serving us. Very strange. Maybe she was visiting a neighbour? 

Anyway, we noticed right away that we weren't given a pen as we usually are in Vietnamese restaurants. We had to wait for her to come to the table and take the order. She was very friendly and took our order promptly. We asked if there was a dish with glass noodles, but she said they don't have that. So, my husband ordered the seafood rice noodle soup instead. I ordered a small pho with well-done beef and beef balls. We also ordered vegetable spring rolls. 

The spring rolls came out first and were piping hot. Unfortunately, they were made with wheat spring roll wrappers instead of the usual rice ones that most Viet. restaurants serve. We prefer the way the rice wrappers bubble and crisp up when fried, however these were still crisp. The filling was pretty good and they were well-stuffed.

The soups came out quickly too and were also piping hot. The flavour of the pho broth was just okay. I had a couple of small pieces of meatball in my soup. I don't think there was even one whole meatball between the little pieces. There wasn't a lot of the sliced beef either. The noodles were well-cooked. My husband's seafood soup was pretty tasteless. He had to add lots of soya sauce just to give it some flavour. The amount of protein was pretty skimpy in his soup too.

For the price, I'd have to say it's really not worth going to this restaurant over the many other choices we have in Mississauga. For the money, it's just not worth it and the food just doesn't taste authentic to me."}
