{"text":"I stopped in on Tuesday for togo lunch.  I ordered the brisket sandwich with cheesy macaroni casserole. I also ordered a sweet tea as the peach cobbler.  I was very satisfied with the meal.  The brisket was tender and flavorful.  The mac was tender and cheesy in every bite."}
{"text":"Now I don't have to wait till my periodic visits to Queen Creek to enjoy all the yummies they offer. The new location is convenient: at Jefferson and 12th Street - just a few steps away from the 12th St./Jefferson exit of the light rail, and there is ample parking at the back for those who prefer to drive to the restaurant. I came during the soft opening and was given the same friendly welcome that I had been accustomed to in the former East Valley location. The restaurant is bright and clean and thankfully so much more spacious than its former incarnation in Queen Creek. I had the barbecue St. Louis style ribs, collard greens, sweet potato fries; everything as scrumptious as in their previous location.  Dessert was a heavenly lemon coconut cake. It was a very satisfying meal and a prelude to many, many more return visits."}
{"text":"OH-MY-GOOODDDNNESSSSS!! There is noooo reason that their food should be THIS gooodddd!! After reading the reviews on Yelp, I was willing to break my diet to give them a try. But, low and behold, I didn't even HAVE TO!!! They had the Impossible Burger meat, which is a plant based meat that tasted EXACTLY like burger meat. I had the symphony fries and my fianc√© had the brorrito, substituting it with the impossible burger meat and dayia cheese. I was still compliant in my meal and it was phenomenal!!! I HIGHLY recommend those that live a plant based diet and those that don't, to check them out. You won't be disappointed. They're soooooo sweet in explaining everything and are very through. You can tell they take a great deal of pride in their food. Again, give them a try as you'll fall in love!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband were both disappointed in the service seemed very unorganized we felt overcharged for what we ordered and my husband  didn't feel to well after having there food we won't be returning"}
{"text":"I had the fish shrimp combo with the rice! It was good. Highly recommend. My bestfriend loved his collard greens and Mac and cheese. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Dear Rhema Soul Cuisine... WHY ARE YOU SOOO DELICIOUS please, keep doing what you're doing! My ONLY regret - not getting the homemade chocolate cake! :D haha

I had wanted to stop by their Queen Creek location in the past but when I finally got to it they were closed. So, while in Phoenix and after debating whether I should just get In-N-Out or Chick-Fil-A on my way home I drove past this place and caught their sign out of the corner of my eye, whipped a U-turn and got excited to eat. 

First, driving by you have to be looking to find it - like I said I caught their logo out of the corner of my eye. There is ample parking behind the location and you walk into a little corridor / breezeway where there used to be several little shops, which are now vacant. The last door is RHEMA! 

Once inside you'll fine a new atmosphere and friendly staff there to great you. The woman behind the counter was extremely friendly and got down to giving me the details of their menu. This trip I chose the Uncle Ron's BBQ Chopped Pork ($14.)

OMG! The BBQ pork w/ sweet sauce along with the parmesan, parsley fries, and 7 cheese macaroni was absolutely delicious and the portions were grand. I couldn't wait to dig in when the plate was set down and it was absolutely soul food. The fries were bomb - they had all the flavor, were crispy, and some of the best. The macaroni was gooey and there was so much cheese, not bland at all. The BBQ pork... oh man, I would do it again. 

Overall, this location is a little hole in the wall but as it starts to grow here in Phoenix I'm sure the lines will begin. The food was amazing and I can't wait to go back and try something else. I'm really looking forward to the chicken and red velvet waffles... I mean, could it get better!?

While this place is growing check out their Yelp page from their Queen Creek Location to get more photos and reviews of how great this place is!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the food. The collard greens had a weird taste. The Mac and Cheese was soggy."}
{"text":"The food I had was amazing! The bbq was moist and flavorful. The Mac and cheese is from scratch! In fact, all of it is. They are so friendly and made excellent recommendations for me based on what I like. This is a new location and the hours are a little limited so plan your visit accordingly. I will be back again for some of the other great menu options."}
{"text":"Omg.. this place is soo good! And its across the street  from my place!! We are working are way through the menu!!"}
