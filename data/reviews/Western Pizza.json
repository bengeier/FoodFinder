{"text":"Reminds me of back home. Appreciate the quality ingredients and care that goes into the pizza they make.

The sauce is boss!"}
{"text":"Just a solid meh. Nothing bad, nothing great, just meh. Meat didn't appear to be of the highest quality, but again not the cheapest, but for the price I would have liked better quality."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Exactly what I was looking for in a good local pizza! Will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Great crust, nice and cheesy pie! Arrived fast and hot!"}
{"text":"I am from Regina and so is this franchise.  My last pizza I ordered was nothing like the one I get back home.  Very disappointed as I have to go 7 hours if I want the Western Pizza I love and know."}
{"text":"This place has never heard the word food costs. When they hand you the pizza you actually need to use both hands.  have yet to have a bad pizza yet.  Their wings and other items should be tried too as it is equally good.  I can eat a medium pizza else where but not here as it is very filling.  One pizza here is equal to two pizzas else where."}
{"text":"Was talking with Mike the owner a couple of days ago. He Informed me that the store will be open 7 days a week with longer hours starting in September. He's got a new partner I believe."}
{"text":"First time order to this location for delivery.  Couple std pizzas and a salad. Pizza was very good and hot when arrived.  Would have rated higher but driver forgot the Greek salad. Will give another go in future."}
{"text":"Ordered from them last night for the first time, delivery was fast and super friendly, food was hot and fresh and delicious! Will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Seriously good pizza, the are fast friendly and don't skimp on the toppings. There is a little be more of a cost compared to their competitors but it is worth the upgrade in price. They have a great selection of a lot of different pizza in combinations I would have never thought of but are great!"}
{"text":"Being from Saskatchewan, I have always loved the pizza from Western Pizza. So I was excited to find out we had one here. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. 

I ordered a mushroom and pepperoni pizza. It looked good and smelled good but lacked whatever the Sask locations have. It was pretty loaded with fresh mushrooms and a generous helping of pepperoni. The crust seemed a bit raw underneath the topping, especially in the middle of the pizza. I do prefer my crust a bit more baked. The sauce seemed a bit too sweet. I like mine with more tang. Overall, it wasn't horrible but there are better pizza places in Calgary and I will most likely go there instead. 

On the positive side, service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I always get the Western Roundup and it never disappoints! This is my go to place for pizza as its always good, and ready for pickup quickly."}
{"text":"Walked in at 9pm for a slice and the place was closing! (Thurs)  Open later on weekends I was told. (11pm) BUT we got a great deal on the last pizza left which was a  still-warm meat lover's. This is something I would never order for myself but it was great! It does not taste like a chain crust whatsoever. It was thick and buttery and not a tad greasy. The meat was heaped on and one slice filled me up. Hubby of course was thrilled as all I ever order is veggie. I am anxious to come back and try one of those next time and see how that does( I pray they use fresh mushrooms and not canned!). I like this pizza as the cheese is of good quality and covers all the toppings. This is what I grew up with and what I prefer.
Friendly folks here. They were on their way out to do a big catering job so if you are having a pizza party in the NW, you know who to call!
The parking lot is a very busy one shared with T&T and China T-Pot, etc but hopefully you will find that the pizza is worth the hunt for a spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing we tried to order pizza on a Saturday night at 8:50 and they were closed!! Pizza and weekends go hand in hand. We ended up ordering from Sammy's and it was fantastic. Oh well they lost a potential customer because I now have my new favorite."}
{"text":"A really solid pizza here.  I ordered delivery so I can't comment on the actual location but the pizza itself was delicious.  It was also delivered fairly fast.  We were told 45 minutes for delivery and it was at our door in a little less than half an hour."}
{"text":"Finally a pizza franchise that knows their marketing colours, none of that fake-Italian, green/white/red stuff, colours are fresh and you can spot their logo a mile away while driving up..but I digress, back to the food.

Located in a nice super plaza, with T&T beside it; looks new, way out in the burbs.  Super clean, window seating in the front.

Anyways, asked for the most popular one, and guy mentioned the Round Up:  pepperoni, salami, ham, green peppers/onions &  mushrooms.  It's super heavy, and he even challenged that if I could finish the large in one sitting right then and there, it's on him....claims that no one has managed to do it, so that shows how much toppings they really lay it down.

Also nice that they offer 'half and half' for a nominal $1.50 extra, wished that Van places would do that too, it'll be nice to try different flavours, the western chicken looked yummy too.  

credit cards ok."}
{"text":"Still love this pizza on thin crust.  Moved from Auburn Bay to Midnapore and Sammy's just isn't cutting it for me.  Called WP today and they threw me a bone and delivered to Midnapore which I hope they add to their delivery area full time.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Well I had high hopes for this place the pizza took 1:30h it was cold and cost me $18 bucks for a very small pizza that they called medium....  they forgot half my order ...disaster"}
{"text":"When I'm looking for a good large tasty pizza these are the guys I think of.  
This is my local pizza joint, literally 2mins from my house and I'm glad I found them.  My husband is not a huge fan of pizza, unless I make it, but sometimes you have the crew over and you just don't feel like cooking. 
I've tried a few of their pizza's and I have to honestly say that the only one I absolutely love is their signature \"Round Up\" pizza.  This is the one I always order, it's loaded with meat and veggies and their sauce is the best I've ever tasted for take out pizza.  
Now if they ever decide to make a Donair pizza I'd love to try it!!!!  
Their delivery is always precise and arrives in the time they quote you."}
{"text":"Pick uppp your pizza if you can,pizza is okay, delivery not so good,always late and have actually forgotten about us"}
