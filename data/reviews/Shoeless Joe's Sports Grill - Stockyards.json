{"text":"Went to Shoeless Joe's at the stockyards the place is big and nice TVs everywhere was able to watch hockey conveniently order a pint and the wings which come with 8 wings and carrots stick. The wings were average however for the price I would expect larger wings or portions."}
{"text":"Been here on many occasions and based off the food alone, id give it 3.5 stars. Some meals are better than others. I had to knock it to a 3 star rating because the service here is so bad. Every single time I've come (except one occasion) the service is slow, of they are forgetful, or they just hang around and chit chat with other workers instead of checking up on the tables. I think the turnover rate for the server is quite high as I keep seeing new faces."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the atmosphere is wicked! Unfortunately I'm only rating 2 stars because the service/management at this location sucks! I came here for a friend's birthday and It took almost half an hour just to receive the bill because the waitress was struggling to split a pitcher we ordered. We asked twice to speak to a manager and did we see one? NO. Finally when we received our bills it was all wrong but we didn't want to wait another half hour so we just paid and left. I couldn't believe it. Did this location just hire people that same day and say okay go work now because it definitely seemed like so."}
{"text":"I have been in this location 6 times now since they opened.  I find that the restaurant has a vibrant atmosphere, good food and great service.  I have tried sever menu items and  haven't been disappointed with anything Iv'e had so far.  I especially like the chicken sandwich they call The Closer.  Very good!

The servers have all been great.  Prompt, friendly and attentive.  Their uniforms don't offend me at all.  Tight dresses don't bother me a bit.  Yes, I'm a man, but a tight dress doesn't make a girl a brainless moron.  I couldn't care less about what they wear.  I'm not going for a T&A display.  I'm going for a bite to eat and a couple of cold beers.  So, wear whatever you want girls, the service hasn't been compromised by the  uniforms.

The management seems to be running a tight ship.  It's a big place and it's very busy.  It's clean, consistent and service is good.  That takes a bit of work.

Keep us the good work guys!

P.S.  I am a former executive chef who has opened several busy restaurants.  I'm no longer in the restaurant business...but I know the work involved in opening a new restaurant.  Things need refinement in the beginning.  Everything and everyone is new.  Systems have to be set up and refined.  And training is done in advance but refinement has to be done when you go live."}
{"text":"Worst. Went there in the 6th inning of The Jays Playoff ALDS (blow out game) It was a little busy, still seats to be had. Waited 15 minutes for some one to come take the order, then 15  more to bring 2 beers. Nuts."}
{"text":"Under the very specific circumstances (very close to tourist spots, full sit down restaurant, mid range pricing) this was a fine spot to stop for lunch and way better than we expected for a place with so many TVs. I had the goat cheese wrap and my husband had the penne pasta. 

The wait staff was polite and even brought me vinegar for my fries instead of ketchup. My personal complaint about the food would be that they use canned mushrooms not real ones."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I reserved a table for 2 using Opentable for Thursday December 22nd 2016 at 7:15PM. What's weird was the reservation was canceled, and upon calling, it appeared to be for no reason said Shoeless Joe's. We were told though to just come in and they should have a table available.

Upon entering, the place looks great. The layout looks nice, and everything seemed clean.

When we were sat at our table, we ordered the Shoeless Joe's buffalo chicken flat bread, and it came out in great time. It was AMAZING. Tasted delicious!

We then ordered our food, I got the Lumberjack burger with a poutine, and my girlfriend got the Beef Stroganoff.

These items too came out in good time and were delicious. 

The server we had was great and attentive, knowing exactly when to come by, and offering the bill at the right time.

All in all, a pretty solid experience! Without the mix up with the reservation (whether it was opentable or Shoeless that made the mistake) it got the 4/5 from us."}
{"text":"Service is great, management is always smiling, interacting and helping out. This location is going do just fine!"}
{"text":"Food was great and staff very friendly... obviously kinks that need to be ironed out but nothing unlike other new spots... will be back"}
{"text":"Went here for a guys night, all in all the place is a fun place to go hang with the boys. Everywhere we looked, we could see sports with the only downside being different TVs showed different games. So if you wanted to watch the raptors destroy the competition, you had to get there in time to get seating in front of a main tv. The wait staff where friendly, however the kitchen staff where lacking on my last visit. First my very friendly waitress informed me the kitchen was out of steak, then she informed me they had steak(all of this was being communicated to me by the waitress), the steak was good the calamari not do much. And finally the bartender, the bartender was mixing the drinks a tad light for my liking. But did pour the draft beer pretty tall so redemption points for this one are in order."}
{"text":"2 stars because the place is really nice and there's plenty of parking. The service, while friendly and apologetic, was overly incompetent and unattentive. 
Homerun nachos are thin frail and stick together into a clumpy flavourless ball of chaos, sticking to the paper beneath.
The fish tacos and calamari were pretty good. 
Looking through the menu, you'll notice that the only pizza choice is a flatbread and there is little to no vegetarian options if that's your preference. 
The bill was screwed up twice but like I said, the waitress had a very good attitude and mistakes happen to the best of us.
If you're looking for a meal, I'd go elsewhere but it's not a bad place for a few pints and a sporting event."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying the Manny comment below seems a lot like one of the workers of this establishment as he CLEARLY has not been to the same Shoeless Joes I have gone to. Where to start with this establishment...before opening this franchise I think one important thing that should have been done was TRAIN. TRAIN TRAIN TRAIN..your servers, staff, hostesses..every single PERSON in that restaurant. I have been to several shoeless joes locations and this one is so poorly managed. There are two levels to this restaurant, the restaurant did look clean and tidy. The only thing I noticed was there weren't any booths with the little tvs you usually see at Shoeless Joes..in fact there didn't seem to be many booth options available - I could be wrong. 

Upon entering this restaurant tonight there was no hostess at the hostess stand. A manager came to the stand and then waved down another hostess standing there as if saying \"HELLO...THERE ARE GUESTS HERE!?\"..finally a hostess came from behind him and brought us to a high top table an inch from the bar stools. There was 5 of us and we got a 4 top table capped at the end with a bar stool. This was a really uncomfortable spot for us and seeing as the restaurant was fairly empty there should have been a better spot for us to be put at. Look at your clientele when coming..if there are kids..DO NOT SEAT THEM AT HIGH TOPS. We had to ask to be moved and were then moved to another high top..except for seating for 6. Our server came by a few minutes after we had sat and we got our drink orders taken. When my brother-in-law asked what was on tap it seemed as if the server did not know what they had off the top of her head since she asked \"what he was looking for?\" as a counter question since they have a whole whopping \"14!? beers on tap..not that impressive. 

We ordered apps..nachos and a single serving of wings to start. Our drinks took over 10 minutes to arrive..these are drinks and should not take that long if their are only max 10 tables sat downstairs. After 5 minutes of dropping off our drinks our server returned to let us know that they don't in fact have ground meat for their nachos but they do have beef chili they can add to it..(again..why do your servers not know the menu by now? Quiz..make them study the menu!!!) 15 minutes passed after our drinks and finally our very flat looking nachos arrived with the wings. The nachos could be tossed a little higher to make it look fuller..and maybe add more than just a spoonful of beef chilli?..presentation wise..it did not look appetizing. The wings were big, meaty and saucy and came with a very tiny portion of fries. What is it with Shoeless Joes and not giving more than 20 fries in those little stainless steel cups? The nachos were not the best - the meat did not look appetizing. However, the wings weren't that bad. DO not order the nachos expecting them to be full..they also come on top of newspaper like paper and with the cheese on top..most of your nachos begin to stick to the bottom. Once we were done our appetizers our mains came however our appetizer plates were still on the table. These should have been cleared before dropping the mains as it makes it rather difficult to put mains down with other plates in the way. The manager began dropping the mains with his busser and asked her to clear our plates as she was just standing there - It seems a little unprofessional to have to tell your bussers and servers to clear plates - they should know this by now!!

I got the Classic Burger with my 20 fries and found the food to be good. The only problem was that it kept taking our server 10-15 minutes to return with refills for our drinks. She would ask one of our guests if they needed a refill and not the others so by the time she came back with the first re-fill one of us was already waiting for ours to be taken. This can cause more work for your servers if they don't just do it once and for all. 

To finish, we decided to pass on dessert as we knew it would take forever to get and opted for the bill instead and a take out box for one of our unfinished meals. We got our bill before we got our take out box all while our dirty main dishes stayed in the center of our table. 

We decided to never return back here until the service is better. Please find a way to train your team on your menu, manners and the very basics of dropping food on a table. I understand that you are a new establishment in the area but the simple things that management can do such as making your servers learn the MENU and teaching them the proper way to bring guests to their table, talk to your guests, give them suggestions..not drop their drinks on them/ on the floor and most importantly BE PROMPT! 

We left shoeless shoes and had to grab our own mint as the hostess at the stand just stood there and only said \"bye\"..no have a good day! thanks for coming or we look forward to having you guys again. The simple things MAKE A DIFFERENCE."}
{"text":"LMAO of course the men are giving it awesome reviews for brainless morons with nothing but big boobs in your face the whole time.Anyone that thinks with there head and not their dicks will see place is shit ... 
Me and my friends sit down and the witness comes over wearing a red vest with her breast falling out and her full bra showing and she has no clue as to what she is doing and we had to repeat our drink order to her 3 times and she still screwed it up and had to come back to our table twice cause she forgot, then she finally brings them and as she puts them down she knocks over one doesn't say sorry and has an attitude as if it was our fault and doesn't even say sorry. 
The food was shit I odered the chicken tenders (hint the word TENDER meaning what soft and mosit) and they where hard and dry another witness came over and told her they where hard she took them back and brings me new ones that where just the same harder and dryer, fries where cold and soggy. 
Asked the brainless twit for the check to be separate and her response was 
Witresss \"oh separate as in not together\"
Me: \"yes separate\"
Witness \" oh so not together\" 
Wtf I felt like I was teaching a ESL class. I get the bill and i see she charged me for 2 drinks and yet i only drank one beer and the twit dropped the first but yet still trying to charge me for it. Another witress had to tell her why not to charge for the first beer. My bill was $27.45 gave the moron a $100 bill and she only gave me back $10.00 change so I had to do the calculation for her and teach her how to give the right change back as if I would leave a $60 tip for horrible service and dried out food with no taste... don't expect service with a brain cause brains and good food is the last thing this Shoeless Joe's cares about... and if the is place does stick around it'll probably be due to the witnesses getting on their knees for the male customer to make them tips 
Here's a tip to the manager next time try not to hire the girls from the local strip club... clearly by the witress we had she was a mailed order bride from Russia turned to a life of hooking before Shoeless Joe's \"saved\" her"}
{"text":"From Markham, this particular location can be a trek since it's on the other side of town.
Nonetheless once you arrive, this is truly an awesome place! 
Cosmetically its appealing to the eyes with the big beautiful clear TV screens at every direction....hence its the perfect place to catch the game.
With two floors, great interior design, parking nearby this location has a lot of benefits.
For starters we ordered a pitcher of Rickards beer but the entree is where it's at.
I ordered their Lumberjack burger; thick, juicy beef pattie layered with fried onions and cheese served with fries.

If ever in west Toronto I'd definitely come back,
the service, ambiance, food and cleanliness makes this place great."}
{"text":"What a welcome sight on St Clair West - a real, sit-down, large chain restaurant that is kid friendly, clean and modern!  Not to knock the area, but really, there's been NOTHING to eat between Caledonia and Keele from a LOOOONG time!  Also a very welcome addition to the Stockyards which I've felt has been kinda \"meh\" since the departure of Target.
  
We went here last weekend and it was great (for a large chain restaurant).  Our group had nachos, pasta, wings and burgers.  I must say I didn't love the burger - it resembled the \"paw burger\" that is commonly used in some restaurants.  But oh well - it was just nice to go out somewhere local!

One little note... I saw in an earlier review that the hostesses were seating kids at the high top tables.  They tried to do this to us too but I explained my kid was too young and would definitely fall off the high stool so they re-thought it and put us upstairs which was \"not open for the evening\" yet but somehow became open and really full, really fast.

Super friendly staff too - we'll see you again!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced, service was mediocre/not friendly, told them we had a discount code prior to eating, they did not apply it to our bill. We came back after we paid (we thought it was applied when paying), and they said they couldn't do anything for us since we paid with credit card. The interior is very large and open but  wouldn't come back here again as the food wasn't impressive especially for the price."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and rumor has it from ex employees that the managers drink while they're working at the restaurants and by the end of the night they blame their workers. Smh! That restaurant needs to have better management and get rid of the managers that aren't doing anything just keeping an eye to a empty restaurant during the day and focus on what they need to improve!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there with a work friend. I ordered a burger off the menu and when it came I immediately found a hair clear as day sitting on the plate. The waitress was really apologetic, and they remade the dish which was good. I wasn't too happy that my colleague had finished his lunch before mine came out. The weird thing was they didn't comp us for anything, not even our cokes or coffee. You would think they would want us to leave on a positive note, especially since the restaurant is out-of-the-way. We will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Shoeless Joe's.

I ordered Buffalo Chicken Tenders with medium wings sauce and dill dipping sauce along with garlic mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were hot and tasty.  The tenders were just warm and overcooked, which made them hard on the outside and dry on the inside.  I don't know if I would get them again.

Bonnie was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"I went with my family and there were only two waitresses for the whole place. Of course, the service was awful (I can't fully blame the waitresses if the manager doesn't hire more staff). Everything took a long time, the food was cold, we got the wrong items, the kids didn't get their dessert. When the time to pay came, we had to wait for almost 15 minutes to find someone to pay and pay. I wrote to their website to complaint, nobody ever wrote back (I guess they don't care). I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"For me this is the best place to watch the hockey game on a Saturday night. There are tv screens everywhere and most importantly the staff here are always busy working. There are so many sports bars where the staff just stand around doing nothing but socializing with each other rather than seeing if their customers need anything. Check this place out if you want good service and lots of tv screens."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY 

Managment team is terrible.

I've gone 3+ times and there was always a problem. Once we didn't have a server because both of the servers thought the other was dealing with us. On Mother's Day, they didn't have enough staff and everything was all over the place. 

The women that left a 5 star review is actually Managment. You can see how they treat there guest by that one review. 

The food is super delicious, so people in the kitchen keep up the good work! 
but unfortunately the experience we had the times we went weren't good. Disorganized is the main word I would use. Ive been to the shoeless joes on Dufferin and the service, and team  were super friendly and fast. 

I will say that the staff is friendly...but not Managment. There is just lack of communication."}
{"text":"Today I go to this place to have lunch. No one noticed me as a customer. Seat at bar not even the girl (bartender ) is available after fifteen minutes she asked me if I wanna something to drink but has no menu to offer after she bring the drink she s gone. I finished my drink w no food and was lunch time  I wonder these are in business to serve customer or just in business to be rude. I spoke to floor manager and explain to him looks like he wouldn't care my issue. SAD. If you don't wanna serve customer go out of business. Very simple. Customer comes there to eat and drink.    Very unsatisfactory place to be."}
