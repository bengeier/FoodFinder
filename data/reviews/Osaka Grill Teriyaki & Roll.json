{"text":"Honestly was expecting so much more for an Asian place. I ordered noodles and my meal came with both rice and noodles... I don't like rice so there's that. On top of that, noodles were barely flavored and tasted just like regular noodles you'd use to make spaghetti. I was very disappointed. Overpriced too. $8+. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat. Daily customer, foods were nice and fresh. Worth a try! Chicken teriyaki bowl's really popular, one of the MUST try dish in this store. With the boba milk tea, that's how you can start your day."}
{"text":"First time eating here, and it was so good! My favorite roll is the Vegas roll, and I was really excited when I found out that they offered this roll, their portions are really good compared to the sushi place in the MU, and not only that but the roll was really really good"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Good food, but the bad customer service overrides that."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before and each time I have had to wait at least 30 minutes for my food but it has been pretty good. Tonight was one of the worst dining experiences of my life. The food was greasy, over cooked and inedible. I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Despite having a lot of offerings on the menu, the prices for some items are way over sensible pricing. The employees aren't very welcoming and skimp out on things like napkins and plasticware, and I got charged extra for a bag once. Although there are definitely some negatives to this place, the food itself is decent and the proximity to campus is a big perk."}
{"text":"The chicken teriyaki is good. I had the large one. I will come back to try their sushi. The unique thing in this restaurant is that they have super nice and ultra friendly people behind the cashier."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by on a hot 110 degree AZ day to try their thai tea with boba. Welp, I've had way better... should've gone to my usual spot.   First: the workers have no concept of customer service. Second: the drink was a major fail, I never thought I could be disappointed in a simple drink made from powder.   The drink was watery and the boba was old, lacking all things boba.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I've never had a dining experience as bad as this one. The woman(probably the owner) was so arrogant and had no respect to customers. Her attitude was even worse than the food."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch because it is so conveniently located across from my building. I ordered the sweet and sour shrimp and asked the cashier if it came with fried rice. She shook her head and said yes. I received my food with white rice. When I went back to clarify with the cashier she tried to tell me that she shook her head no and told me only white rice. She was a lie. And the shrimp was not good at all. Of course they have this sign by the cash register that says \"No refunds or exchanges. All sales are final.\" I am so disappointed. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"WTF. Seriously a Teriyaki bowl with only rice, rice, and more rice, with a bit of chicken and sauce, no veggies. Never have I ever has a chicken teriyaki bowl that did not have veggies..cheap ass owners, RIPOFF! Obviously I will never go back"}
{"text":"Paid 20 dollars for 2 chicken teriyaki bowls with raw chicken. We went up to the counter only to see the \"No refunds\" sign. We had to throw away our full bowls of undercooked, pink gummy chicken. Would never eat here again and I am very surprised that this place is not shut down due to the quality of their food and customer service."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience I have ever had.  I ordered the fried California roll and it had eel sauce all over it. I went to the counter to ask for another roll because on the menu it doesn't not say it comes with eel sauce on it and the woman made sure to tell me three times that I did not say I didn't want sauce on the roll. The menu does not say it comes with sauce on it. After 5 minutes of me explaining that the menu does not say that eel sauce on the roll and I would either like my money back or a new roll, she finally is making me a new roll. Way to treat a customer."}
{"text":"Oh man! Have I learned a valuable lesson! Read the reviews first. Rookie mistake I know. I was in the area walking around and stopped in. My first red flag should have been how empty it was. My second red flag should have been the service. No hello or welcome. The lady that I assume everyone is referring to in the other reviews was at the register. She had that look( the look I sometimes had when I had a looooonnngggg day in the food industry) but I never skipped out on customer satisfaction. She just opened 30 minutes before I ordered. She had the I don't want to be dealing with this guy. This guy who wants to buy food so you can keep your restaurant and your job. I paid and she didn't hand me a pen to sign. I literally had to reach over the counter to grab one. Now for the food. I have words I can not say here to describe the food! It looked like someone had chewed up the chicken and beef and regurgitated it on top of the rice. I had a styrofoam container with chopped up chicken and beef smeared over the rice. Ok I thought not the most appealing. The chicken and beef were super dry and some were undercooked. I have 5 years of culinary experience. But it doesn't take that to know when you are served leftovers or even frozen food. I had to stop eating after 5 bites out of fear I would see my meal again real soon! All in all I'm ashamed that I had to give it one star. But you have to in order to review. Terrible service and now I know why people like UA and not ASU. This place would make me choose a college far far away from this restaurant. I'm definitely contacting someone about the horrendous food quality. To the owners I beg of you. Start with a smile. It goes a long way. Work your way though the other problems when you learn to smile"}
{"text":"Great selection of various Asian dishes. All the white people who go here love the Terriyaki Bowls but there is an array of other wonderful dishes."}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible Service!! The lady running the register was so rude. Treated everyone poorly. Rolled her eyes every time anyone asked for something.  The food is mediocre, and the service is horrendous!! I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three or four times, and the workers have never been polite. They seem sad and resentful. This is despite whether or not I add a tip to the receipt. I keep coming back for the teriyaki bowls, but the Arizona bowl might give you indigestion. Prices are reasonable.   Also, for some reason they make you pick up your food at the register even though they have a huge empty counter. One of the workers keeps walking up to this empty counter and spitting behind it, so I guess I would prefer she stop doing that before serving the food there. But you literally have to walk in front of people that are ordering to get your food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since 2014 when I first came out here for school. The food here used to be phenomenal. In recent months not so much. I typically order the chicken teriyaki bowl but this time around I decided to deviate from my typical menu selections. I got Chicken Yakisoba. Its essentially chicken, stir fry noodles cabbage and rice. It was a horrible meal. I'm struggling to finish it as we speak.  I doused it in close to 10 packets of soy sauce and still no improvement.   Something I realized about this place is that all their food is decent but nothing is outstanding. Honestly it all tastes the same. The specialty drinks are highly overpriced, their chicken occasionally has a gummy taste like under-cooked steak but its chicken and not necessarily under-cooked. I suspect they just use cheap chicken.   Come here if you're tired of Panda Express and want to try a different Oriental cuisine. The food is bland but filling and the portions are very economical (great portion sizes).    Bottom Line: Come through and try it ! THERE ARE MUCH WORSE PLACES IN TEMPE."}
{"text":"Dont order salmon roll at any cost!!! It was my first time eating sushi with fish bone. And guess what the owner said? It is fish, so it has bone... ?!?!?&$ what? but I order sushi tho  however, I love their orange chicken; it is the only dish I order from this restaurant and the only reason I give two stars."}
{"text":"Now, this is my favorite place in town. The food so fresh. I love there sushi the rice still warm, there black paper chicken is very crunch and crispy and the teriyaki chicken. Everything is so good. Highly recommend place to eat."}
{"text":"really good food but overpriced. also the employees don't really make an effort to give good customer service."}
{"text":"Worst food in Tempe. Recently went and ordered two Arizona Bowls with vegetables instead of rice. My stomach never instantly hurt so bad in my entire life. My girlfriend threw up from eating her bowl. I don't recommend going here if you like not being treated when walking into a restaurant and being served below mediocre food. Will not go back again, highly recommend not going here. Worst service and most unfriendly people in Tempe."}
{"text":"The most disgusting experience I'v ever had. The service is the worst, and the oil is not fresh. I would give a negative rating if I can. Oh, you must keep the receipt if u finish ordering. If not, the waiter will yell at u like ur boss."}
{"text":"Food is amazing love their sushi and their bowls! Eat here all the time but the workers are rude and not friendly at all. There make you feel like you're bothering them when you order food or ask a question ."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since arriving on campus and had the deep fried California rolls which were amazing. They're big and will get you full and clog your arteries, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The owner and the young woman who works there are very polite and display excitement to see me. On the other hand, there's another lady there who always looks stressed out. Nothing against her, but she just doesn't smile or show any kind of excitement to see anyone. One time I was there she was calling out my order, not in English, but in Mandarin Chinese (ThankfulIy, I took Mandarin Chinese in high school). She could have at least called it out in both languages without assuming one of the Chinese speakers ordered it. My second nitpick is their drinks. As aforementioned in my previous review, they are literally three ingredients: water, ice (exception: hot), and powder. They are overly sweet and literally give no taste of tea. At times they've put boba in my drinks after I instructed them told not to."}
{"text":"This place is very good and offers a wide variety of Asian cuisine. Including Taiwanese, Japanese, and Chinese, but there are also many more. Osaka also has incredibly good slushes and Boba Tea. The owners are very generous and have given me free parking passes and food a couple of times. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys authentic Asian food."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!! The chicken is not fresh at all and everything taste really bad."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! The food is decent but after coming here for a long time the owner showed me she clearly didn't care about her customers.  On the menu there are two \"dumpling type\" options. #55 steamed dumplings & #56 gyoza. The only option called \"dumplings\" on the menu is #55, so when I went to the front I said \"can I have the dumplings please\" and she took my order. I paid and went outside only to notice she'd charged me for the \"gyoza\". I went back and politely said that I had wanted the steamed dumplings. She told me that she already told the guy the gyoza so I'd just have to eat them, and that I couldn't have what I had asked for.   I tried to explain that gyoza and steamed dumplings are different and that I had clearly asked for the dumplings, not anything called gyoza. And if they are the same than why didn't she ask which one I was referring to? Well she told me there was nothing she could do. So I left. Won't be returning to deal with that again."}
{"text":"ASUs got great eats... This is not one of them... Bland food with bland representation. Not enough sauce, tho more just made it less dry- not taste any better.  The cashier seemed annoyed that I took her away from her phone. And all the condiments (salt,pepper, and soy. No sriracha) and utensils are behind the counter. You have to ask for them. But I really didn't want to because I didn't want to bother her anymore than already had by coming in... If you want good- No. Great Teriyaki- goto Grilled Avenue instead"}
{"text":"Yummy classic Asian American style dishes. They have a lot of average dishes, they all taste good but nothing that makes you go wow. The best dish on the menu is probably the black pepper chicken. Everything is kinda expensive so that's why I give it a 3 star."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. I'm currently sitting here, waiting for my food. It's been about 30 minutes AT LEAST and more than 10 orders have been called and ready before mine. Don't waste your time with this sub-par food and crap service."}
{"text":"I just dropped by here for a small snack. The person behind the counter was quite polite in a curt sort of way. This may be why some of the reviews felt that the service was bad. This was not my experience.   I was tempted to get the sushi but ended up ordering the egg drop soup with seaweed. It was different from traditional egg drop soups at Chinese restaurants, with the egg more \"omelettized\" in the broth, but it worked. It's quite a large portion and is served scalding hot, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Lol the people who work here should probably not be anywhere near the customer service industry. The food is dank though"}
