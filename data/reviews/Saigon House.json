{"text":"So glad to be back at one of my favorite pho joint!! I used to come here very often because it's close to my previous office, and really in Brampton the choices are very limited. I once rated this as one of the best pho place in Toronto, on my latest visit I was really disappointed.  The broth taste flavorless and the portion is much less than before with less meat and noodles.  As usual we also ordered a spring roll, it is the same spring roll but the outside is still soft, it will be better if it stays in the deep dryer for another 30 seconds. Would I come back again?  Maybe if I need to go to Brampton again next time and no other choices."}
{"text":"This place tasted like any other average Vietnamese place out there. Nothing special. The meat on their rice dishes tastes sweet and their pho broth tastes heavily of msg. I've tried their pad thai.  It tastes sweet almost like a sweetened ketchup with a hint of fish sauce. They tried. The chicken curry and rice was enjoyed by sister. It had a nice curry and coconut flavour to it. The veggies in the dish were cooked just right. Tender crisp."}
{"text":"I have been going to the other location on Kennedy for almost 10 years and glad this location opened a couple years ago, as it is walking distance from our house.  The pho is great here; the reason we keep coming back!  We also enjoy other items on the menu, such as the vermicelli dishes, the curries, and some of the other Thai stir fry noodle dishes.  The service is good as the servers always remember us and always has a smile whenever we come in."}
{"text":"I had the thai green curry and my partner had the pad thai. I loved it, the green curry sauce has perfectly balanced flavours of spicy, sweet, salty and tangy in a creamy base. It had some vegetables in it and a side of rice to eat with it. But I think the curry itself would taste good with just about anything. I've eaten Thai green curry before and this was absolutely my choice. Some places take spice out of foods and I'm always disappointed. These guys serve authentic! My friend  received a huge plate of pad thai, it looked really good and I think that's what I will try from the menu next time. They enjoyed it too and said it was some of the best they ever had."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef vermicelli with lemongrass. On the menu it was listed as $10.99. My husband went up to pay and we got charged $13 for my dish. He did not know how much my dish was listed as so didn't question it. I didn't notice the overcharge until we were on the way home complaining how bad tasting and overpriced the food was."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and notice that there is inconsistency in the pho soup broth quality which is very unfortunate -and yes, bland tasting \"dishwater\".  Also, not a fan of the utensil containers on the tables - i am aware that many do this but not all!  Especially not a fan when the containers aren't  properly washed (if at all ever) or maintained since they look dirty.  These should not be permitted in general, not sanitary.  Will most likely favor other pho restaurants over this from now on, not worth it.."}
{"text":"Not sure what to say about this place.  Tried something different like a Satay Seafood pho.  Decent amount of seafood for $8 and included crab meat, mussels, a couple of shrimp and fish balls.  They were okay, mostly frozen food from what I could tell.  The rice noodles were cooked nicely and while the broth tasted good, it wasn't \"satay\".  It was more like some chili oil with normal pho broth.    Service was adequate and place is clean and it was even busy at 2 pm.  Would I visit again? Maybe, if I'm near Bramalea City Centre but it doesn't compare to any of the wonderful pho places in Mississauga"}
{"text":"I ordered the well done beef pho with tendons. Pho was bland - not much flavour or salt.  Sadly, It had very little meat (large size)."}
{"text":"I don't know why they have changed so much. I think they might be under new management. We've never had a problem when we order in store, but when we order through skip the dishes they leave out half our order. We ordered two combos for two as I had four friends over. They decided not to send the spring rolls and decided not to send the pineapple fried rice. And they refused to compensate us for their error. So basically as a customer whatever they choose to send you, is what you get. The second time we ordered from them, we went with only one combo for two and listed the items, they decided to give us tofu and vegetable red curry and not the red chicken curry that we ordered and leave out the white rice. I will no longer order from this restaurant, as they can't follow basic instructions. If you're going to eat here, it's best to do it in person because if they screw up you can point it out to them, but I caution you about ordering with them through skip the dishes."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I'm not a pho fan but looks like their soups are amazing and my boyfriend says so too"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming here for YEARS and I'm surprised I haven't made a review sooner.  Seriously, my friends and I come here probably 3 times a month.  We have truly become regulars.  The staff definitely know who we are.  They even know one of my friend's orders as soon as he walks in!  While I've been coming here for a long time, I usually stick to the same 5 dishes lol.  My go-to would definitely be T15, which is thick noodle with chicken and black bean sauce.  SO GOOD.  I get cravings for this OFTEN, no matter how many times I've eaten it.  It is A LOT of food and I usually have to bring half of it home if I'm eating it alone.  There is a spicy kick to it, but nothing too crazy.  The black bean sauce is so delicious and I love that it comes with an array of veggies.  My next go to is the grilled chicken on rice with a fried egg.  It's very basic, but when you put the sauce on the rice, everything comes together wonderfully.  Sometimes I decide not to get an egg and just get the 2 pieces of chicken on rice.  Which is, I believe, C1.  Meat sizes are very generous.  Of course, on cold or sick days, I opt to get a P7 small.  Which is pho with rare beef and beef balls.  LOVE beef balls.  When I really want to treat myself and want something sweet, I end off with a mango shake.  YUM.  Service is fast and your food usually comes out in 10 minutes or less.  Pho comes out instantly.  Prices are very reasonable although they have gone up over the years.  I can see why. It's self seating, so as soon as you walk in, just pick a spot!  The people working there notice fairly quickly and will bring you menus and hot tea.  Don't ask for a bill.  Once you're done eating, go up to the cash and they'll have your bill ready for you there.  You can do split payments too.  It's no trouble for them."}
{"text":"Never actually been inside this restaurant, but ive ordered from here using SkipTheDishes a few times. They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was extremely full when my boyfriend asked me to meet up with him for lunch. He chose this little small restaurant, in a busy plaza. The location is very small, not very great for groups. Always packed. I ordered some appetizers while the boyfriend ordered the pho, this man loves his pho. The grilled BBQ pork is DELICIOUS, perfectly done. The fresh spring rolls; taste like every day rolls and as for the pho; it was good, very rich in flavour. Oh and my avocado smoothie; ugh, it's a must, every time, they definitely touch down with this one."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Very consistent pho and the grilled meat is always done right. A go to is C3 the grilled chicken with egg on top of fried rice. Yumm.."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is always busy. You can opt for either their dine in or take out. The food is always fresh and decently priced. Always delicious. My favorites on the menu are; the wonton soup, veg. Spring roles, P1 which is the rare beef and rice noodle pho, lastly their crispy chow mein.   In the event you stop by, overlook the spelling errors on the menu."}
{"text":"I would give it a 3.5* to be sure. This was decent Vietnamese food. We've eaten here several times. When a restaurant is full of Vietnamese ppl so this is always a good sign. The only issue was it was jammed & the service was slow."}
{"text":"This was and will be our first and only visit. My wife got a seafood dish and I ordered a brisket ph√≥. Huge portions, seafood was tasty, but the soup was fatty and most beef was inedible; service was terrible. Ultimately we still had to ask three times for a bill that never came, so went to the bar to pay. But the worst part was cleanliness. Bathrooms are messy, tables aren't wiped properly, food is simply swept onto the chairs or floor, and the bar area was cluttered and unkempt. Poor attention to detail."}
{"text":"A decent place to get Vietnamese or Thai food. This small review will revolve around the Vietnamese Cuisine. I just took my usual Pho with Tendon and beef balls (actually was suppose to come with well done flank but they replaced it with beef balls upon request with no extra charge). The pho was yummy (especially on a cold day). Portion wise...Well there was a small portion of Tendon present. UntiI i actually saw a piece I wasn't sure it was there. For desert I ordered fried banana with green tea ice cream (ice cream comes with it with no extra cost). I was surprised as I was served a plate with a good portion of ice cream and fried banana. Also don't get the sour sop shake. There are others that are better."}
{"text":"I tried to order from these guys from skip the dishes. I waited 10 minutes but my order was never confirmed even though the money came out of my account. I tried calling the restaurant numerous times but no one answered. I contacted skip the dishes directly, who also tried to get in touch with the restaurant with no success. So my order was cancelled and my money was refunded. Skip the dishes customer service was excellent! I am very impressed at their prompt actions to rectify the problem. Very dissatisfied with Saigon House. Ended up eating microwave Mr.Noodles for dinner to try to satisfy my craving for hot tasty noodles. It didn't work. :( I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"My first time coming here,  I went with a friend and let me just start off by saying that the food was great... Everything else,  not so much.   It's a Saturday night and the place is packed... So we wait to be seated. They tell us we can choose where to sit so we picked a table that seats 6. We ask they guy if we can sit here he just puts our menus down and leaves.  Okay.    So then another guy comes and puts down this order paper and a pen and then leaves again.  So after a couple of minutes deciding on what to order,  we wait for a waiter to come by and nothing happens. we have no idea what to do.  So we look around and we see a table across the room using the paper/pen so we write down our order,  then when the guy comes I ask if we wrote it correctly and he doesn't respond.  Fine.    Now a bigger party (of 6) come in and after a couple of minutes one of the guy comes and asks my friend and I if we wouldn't mind moving across the room to a smaller table. We didn't mind, however if they had taken the time to look around the room and seat us we wouldn't have had to pick up and move. Now luckily we hadn't gotten or food yet, because if we did we'd have to carry it across the room ourselves.   The food was good,  but our appetizers and entr√©es were served out of order.  No one came to check on us,  we had to flag them down to ask them questions and every answer was delivered during a rolling stop.   Customer service was not existent, I've had more attentive service from pizza deliver guys. Maybe it was the dinner rush but they could have been more organized. If you're offering sit down service, when customers sit down you gotta serve them.   Moral of the story, you thinking Saigon? Do takeout."}
