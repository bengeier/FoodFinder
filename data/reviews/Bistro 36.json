{"text":"Decided to try a mid morning breakfast on a Saturday. Place was typical breakfast place decor but very tidy.  Helped ourselves to seats and waited several minutes to be acknowledged. Minimal staff had to attend customers that were paying before bringing menus.  Service overall was slow for a 1/3 full establishment.  
Food - overall very good. We had the Classic Frittata, Bistro breakfast, Egg white omelet and a regular omelet all made to order.  Generous servings with home fries, choice of toast and garnished with orange slices and honeydew melon. Good value.

Will go back again to give them an opportunity to be improve on customer service.

update 10/7/16 - went back for a lunch try.  Food excellent. Very untidy."}
{"text":"This place opened  a little while ago, and I've been curious to try it, and today was the day curiosity won and i stopped in.  I must say, its clean, and rather inviting.  There is a TV on the wall and they have wifi.  This place is great for breakfast, and price vs portion, its fair trade for sure.  Yup we found some quality eats here.  Today i had their classic special to go, and it was well worth it.  Next time i hope i have time to enoy in the cafe and maybe try their eggs bennedict or one of their other menu items.  Who knows, maybe a lunch time stop.  So first impression is good.  I also noticed they can put together large orders with advanced notice. Sometimes at the office we take advantage of services like this and call in an order or someone will swing by and drop off our order for pick up in an hour so i may try this service here if we are all in slacker mode one friday before a long weekend.  So first impression is a good one.  This is on the radar now and i look forward to the next visit"}
{"text":"Great local place to eat! people are friendly,good coffee and it was nice and clean. 

We really enjoyed this place, happy we stopped in to grab lunch"}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprising little spot! Not your typical little diner. Wonderful food, cooked with love and presented by friendly and helpful staff. I think this will become a regular hang out for us! This time we tackled the all day breakfast menu. The western omelet was fantastic! Next time I think we need to attack the lunch menu. So many awesome looking items to try!"}
{"text":"This place has some very good reviews, albeit from a very small pool. It was very close to where my car was being serviced so I wandered over to have some breakfast.

With a closing time of 4:00pm, their menu features (all day) breakfast items, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, and a few entrees. There's a little bit of everything. In addition to traditional and classic Canadian fare, there's Mexican, Italian, Greek, Asian, South Asian, Cajun, and more. I think they got most bases covered.

I ordered the Eggs Jenny, a variation of Eggs Benedict - two poached eggs on house made crab cakes with hollandaise sauce and home fries.

The crab cakes, made with real crab (not surimi), were good but maybe not outstanding. The eggs were perfectly poached to my liking. The home fries were also good. The execution of this dish was very good but the hollandaise sauce was disappointing. It was thick, lumpy, and bland. I tried not to eat it.

The restaurant was clean and the service was very good. The rest of the menu looks interesting enough, with reasonable pricing for me to come back. I just won't order anything with hollandaise."}
{"text":"My son took me there for lunch today and it was surprisingly good. The portions are large enough that you will probably have left-overs for later. My son ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and loved it. I had the jambalaya rice (basmati rice with chicken, shrimp in a saucy sauce) which was also very good. The price is very reasonable, the service very good, the restaurant was very inviting as well. We will definitely be going there again. Soon :)"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise in whalooks like an industrial plaza. Service was excellent and what I ordered was spot on. 

Good mixed menu from the burger and fresh cut fries I had through lamb curry and salmon entries. 

It's easy to muss but right beside Subway and maxi mart"}
