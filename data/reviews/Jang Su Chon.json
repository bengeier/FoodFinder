{"text":"Friendly service, generous portions, good selection of banchan. Will come here again"}
{"text":"Definitely the best mackerel I've had for $2.99! They give you a large serving of fish which is fresh, moist and flavourful. Servers are friendly and willing to refill banchans without you having to ask - empty dishes ultimately signal that they need to be refilled, awesome! Service was surprisingly slow as the restaurant had only 3 other tables to attend to. Ordered the Chicken Gamjatang, Kimchi Chigae and Kalbi and dishes took almost 30mins to be served.... Le sigh.  Gamjatang broth was tasty with generous helpings of succulent chicken - just wished they topped it off with bean sprouts and more potatoes. The Kimchi Chigae was too sour tasting for me and not spicy at all, quite disappointing. The Galbi on the other hand was a bit on the fatty side and was not grilled long enough. Overall impression was alright. Maybe I didn't order the right dishes, because none of the entrees really stood out to me."}
{"text":"The quality of food is spectacular and the service was good as well. The price is quite fair for their dishes. Compared to other korean restaurants, the taste and experience was amazing. The people there were really friendly and gave us many refills on the side dishes. The area is very spacious and good for family or friends dining together."}
{"text":"we went here with a Korean friend for her birthday - it was her place of choice! They are very generous with free side dishes, and they'll refill them too! The food was great, a real feast. The grilled Mackerel was 2.99 and was delicious! Best Korean food I've had in a while and the price were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Hey guys. I was just introduced to this korean restaurant by my aunt and uncle. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. I also learned it is owned and cooked by an elderly woman who once ran a korean restaurant in China. This restaurant was recently opened and is a hidden gem. Its a place you must check out if you are a fan of korean food. If you are a big pork bone soup fan, its fantastic. Not overlly spicey like other places. Lots of meat as well.  I was also glad to see they serve a good number of side dishes.   The only downfall is that its cash only.   Let me know what you think. All i can say is that im korean and when it comes to korean food im quite crtical. If i enjoyed this place im pretty sure you will too!"}
{"text":"It took me awhile to give this retaurant a try and after all the wait, I was not disappointed.   We arrived on a Monday night and were immediately seated. The place was bustling with customers but only had 2 wait staff working the entire room.   I tried the spicy bulgogi beef, the bibimbap with a appetizer serving of soon tofu, and the pork bone soup (gamjatang).  Prices are good, food is flavorful and fresh, and service is decently timely. The pork bone soup is my favorite. The meat was tender and falls off the bone and the broth was flavorful. The meal is also served with a pitcher of hot tea on the house.  We got served 6 small servings of side dishes that were on the house.  Kimchi, been sprouts, sea weed, pickled cucumbers, rice flour cake with soy, tofu with soy.  Halfway through our meal, this little older lady came to ask how our meal was and offered us 4 deep fried dumplings on the house.   They accept cash and credit card. You definitely get value for money.   I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Korean food has to be one of my favourite comfort foods out there and Toronto is pretty lucky with the numerous Korean places to get a good bowl of gamjatang. I think the simplicity of Korean food is what I really like in their cuisine, especially their stews.  Spadina Avenue is colloquially known as Chinatown due to the history the place has had with the Canadian Chinese community in Toronto. Now a more accurate term would be East-Asia Town, as Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese cuisine have made a home in the area as well.  Off on St. Andrew's Street, you'll find two Korean restaurants on the north side. One is called Ka-Chi which is a chain of Korean restaurants you can find in Toronto and the other is called Jang Su Chon, a Korean family owned spot serving up authentic Korean dishes.  Pretty spacious inside, Jang Soo Chon can seat small to large groups (up to 10) and is very reasonably priced, especially since it seems like a top pick for University of Toronto students.

{"text":"It was best meal that i had during the trip in Canada. It is very cheap price for awesome foods compared to other overpriced korean restaurants that offer okay foods. Also, service was pretty good and server refilled banchan (side dishes) quickly and gave me a free pancake. If i were living in Toronto, i would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We love, LOVE this place! We were on our way to next door when a woman getting take-out said we had to try this place. So glad she told us, it's our new favourite place in the city! Been there many times now and never had anything we didn't love. The pancakes are fabulous, as are all the little dishes you get with your meal. I'm a seafood only eater but my boyfriend is a huge carnivore. Both very satisfied here. If you haven't tried Korean food, start here. I had a calamari dish here that is one of the best things I have eaten in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place a couple of times now, we ordered too much once i think, because they give us grill fish for free! The services are good and the prices are really good. The decoration is family style, really can't ask for too much since they already make service, food quality and services perfect. I will come back with more friends."}
{"text":"This little Korean gem is located near Chinatown and Kensington Market in Toronto and is one of my best-kept secrets. Most people come looking for the more well known place next door (Ka-Chi) The food is inexpensive and absolutely delicious and the staff are very friendly.  I suggest coming hungry because the portions are huge and there are unlimited appetizers/ snacks. The service is relaxed but the food comes quickly and they never rush you out. This is a good place to come with a group since they seem to always be able to accommodate us, but try to make a reservation if you will have a party of 8+ I've noticed that whenever I come with a group of 4 or more the chef will always send out a couple of complimentary dishes! Sometimes it's the delicious grilled mackerel, once it was a breaded chicken dish. For anyone on a student budget, it's always nice to get free food!  I love their pork bone soup, Jap Chae but my favourite dish is the \"Duk BealGi bul go gi\" (I just call it the #3, on the page with the stone bowl items). The Bi Bim Bap is also delicious!   Considering that most places in this area can be very dingy this restaurant is very clean and bright. TV's on either side play the news and K-pop music videos.  It is not handicapped accessible as there are about 10 steps to go up to the restaurant and the washrooms are located downstairs.  They accept debit and credit cards over $10."}
{"text":"Given this restaurant is located right next door to another Korean joint that has a few locations and a following of fans, the chances of this place succeeding are quite slim.    I can't believe we've been missing out!  Why is this place not busier?!    The side dishes were plentiful.  I liked all of them.  Kimchi, seaweed, pickled cucumbers, etc.  We even got to try an extra dish of small potatoes which tasted like no other potatoes I've ever had.  Great selection.    Next, our appetizers came.  Why did we order chap chae and the seafood pancake as appetizers when we had all those banchan??  What were we thinking?!  Chap chae was very tasty with a good mix of vegetables and beef.  The seafood pancake was crisp and light, full of julienned vegetables and seafood.    Our mains were going to push all of us over the top.  A few of us had the Ginseng chicken soup.  Very hearty on a cold winter night.  Ginseng is expensive and so it wasn't as flavourful as I would've preferred, but the amount of chicken and rice made up for it.  LA kalbi was tender and tasty.  Nice pieces and not a lot of fat.  Another dish we ordered were the soon tofu chi gae, each coming with a whole, grilled mackerel.  If you don't like fishy fish, you can probably just ask them to omit that dish since it comes on the side anyway.  The dolsot bibimbap looked pretty good, as well as the spicy chicken.   Now, to bring the service to the next level:    There was only one server, a woman.  She was as efficient as she could, being a one woman show.  She brought us complimentary dumplings!  That was completely unexpected but greatly appreciated!  In the middle of our meal, an older lady came to the front, went to each table, and said thank you to every patron in the restaurant!  How sweet is that?  She was probably the chef, cooking all the food, and took the time to acknowledge the customers!    Our group really enjoyed our meal and would not hesitate to go back.    Keep this little gem of a restaurant in business!  Don't cave into the chain restaurants, and give this place a try!  :)"}
{"text":"Cheap and family-style stuff. Nice owners as well, they would offer something on the house - like gyoza. I'd definitely go there and have a chicken ginseng soup if I catch a cold :P The BBQ set seems to be of good value but I haven't tried it."}
{"text":"So I went here recently with my parents and my husband.  The food was great and the servings were huge.  We ordered the Beef Bokeum Myun (beef stir-fried noodles) $10.99, the Beef Bulgogi $11.99, Chicken Gam Pung Ki (deep-fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce) $12.99, and steamed rice $1.50 and we were stuffed.  The beef stir-fried noodles were delicious.  The dish had lots of different types of mushrooms in it (and I LOVE mushrooms!).  Lots of tender beef and very flavourful.  The Beef Bulgogi was good, but honestly it tasted like Beef Bulgogi at any other Korean restaurant I've been too, so while good, nothing extraordinary.  The Chicken dish was so yummy.  It was like General Tao Chicken but infinitely better!  The batter was crispy and the meat-to-batter ratio was high.  The sauce was spicy but not too spicy and sweet but not cloyingly so and sticky, but in a good way, lol.  It was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet.    They even gave us a complimentary onion pancake!  It was a bit oily/greasy, and tasted too \"eggy\", but hey, I love free!  Service was really good.  They brought us 6 banchans (free appetizers that Korean restaurants give out) and re-filled the ones we finished without us even asking.  At the end of the meal an older lady (maybe the chef?) came up to us and asked us how the meal went.  Even with her limited English, she was very friendly and was glad that we enjoyed our meal.  Just a warning, on the day we went, none of the staff spoke English that well.  I have an intolerance to sesame seeds, and since Korean cuisine has lots of sesame seeds, I always have to tell the server to tell the kitchen to omit the sesame seeds.  Well, the server didn't understand what I was saying.  Luckily, I planned for the situation and had Google Translated \"No sesame seeds, please\" into Korean and copied it down onto a piece of paper (yeah, it's true, I don't have a smart phone / internet on my phone, don't make fun, ok?) and showed the server the paper.  Let me tell you, writing Korean characters is not easy, but I must have done an ok job because none of our dishes had any sesame seeds in them!  Anyway, just a warning that if you have food allergies/restrictions/intolerances, be prepared in case the staff you get that day don't speak English well!  When they brought us our bill they gave us 4 free bottles of \"Korean yogurt.\"  They were little tiny drinkable yogurts (like Danactive or YOP), so cute, and so delicious!    Food was great.  Lots of free stuff.  Staff were pleasant and friendly.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"5 star!!!! Definitely the best quality you can ever get with such a cheap price. The owner is so nice!!! My friend and I visited once after their business hour. She still let us in and served us freshly made kimchi side dishes!!"}
{"text":"Came here actually looking for my old Pho place next to Pho Hung, but was surprised to see it's gone and has now become a Korean restaurant.  I find that odd, since next door there was already a korean restaurant.  But curiosity got the best of me.  I couldn't help but notice the deliciously looking photos of their dishes posted on the outside of the buidling.  They also had many of the popular Korean dishes listed for $5.99 which is a great deal and also with a sign that advertised they give out \"7 free side dishes\" (banchan).   Well, when I walked in, I noticed at least half a dozen of tables with occupants devouring their meals.  So that is a good sign in my books.  I'm only giving it a 4 stars is because, service was a bit slow in the beginning.  There was only one older lady (probably partial owner) who was serving and taking orders for all the customers.  I ordered the Gam Ja Tang which came out boiling hot.  The bowl was stacked to the top and was loaded with meaty pork bones.  I only found two pieces of potatoes which I ususally don't care for, so another bonus.  It was so tasty and authentic.  I would have eaten as fast as the other restaurant patrons if only it wasn't so hot.  The side dishes that were included were also very authentic and tasty.  They give you quite a generous portion of these as well.  I wanted to eat everything in front of me, but it was simply just too much food.  Maybe next time, I'll bring someone with me so that I won't feel so guilty for eating so much.  If anyone is in Chinatown and looking for authentic, quality, exceptionally well priced Korean food, look no further than around the corner of Spadina and St. Andrew Street.  Please give this place a try!  I'm sure it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant, but I'd say a bit underwhelming. Great tasty beef bibimbap! Missing out on free glass noodles (though I know not all Korean restaurants give these out, but I was definitely craving them lol), and service was quite slow. Also, found a hair in one of the dishes =/.   Pretty clean decor, and not a bad place, but there are definitely better and yummier Korean restaurants in my opinion."}
{"text":"after eating caribbean food for a week, i was craving some asian food, specifically korean.  we were in toronto for a few hours, and found jang su chon on yelp.  when we walked in, the place was occupied with people having late lunch, but none were koreans which made me cringe a little.  this was my coworker's first time trying korean food, so i suggested a few well known items to him, and he chose dolsot bibimbap.  quickly, some banchan were delivered to our table followed by our main orders of bibimbap and spicy pork bbq.  the spicy pork bbq was mildly spicy and the meat was tender, but there just was too much oil in the plate.  my coworker liked banchan more than the bibimbap.  he claimed that his main dish was too bland, even after putting some red chili paste and soy sauce.  surprisingly, he loved napa cabbage and cucumber kimchi.    if the restaurant was located in southern california, i'd have given a 2 star rating, but since i had no other standard to measure in toronto, and it did satisfy my korean food craving somewhat, 3 star rating is fair.     service was friendly and prompt, and price of the food was around $8-$15 range.  a parking structure is conveniently located right next to the restaurant.  p.s. - jang su means long life and chon means a village, so the literal translation is a village with old people."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup was excellent.  Bibimbap was good, but the stone bowl was not quite hot enough to crisp more of the rice.  I ate an excellent meal for a very, very reasonable price"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service.  They take credit cards now.  My family just enjoyed a wonderful meal here."}
{"text":"here became my favourite korean restaurant in toronto! as a korean, it's surprisingly cheap price, they got tasty authentic korean food varieties. i love this place. definately would go again."}
{"text":"Good portions. Grilled mackerel for $2.99. Technically I would be full from a Mackerel and a bowl of rice, but felt bad it would come to $5. Ended up ordering a chicken dolsot bibimbap as well."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Not amazing not awful. Decent prices and large portions. Good selection of banchan (side dishes).  Also gave pajeon (korean pancake) - complimentary. would go back if i'm in the area and craving for korean They are open late till 4:00am 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Toronto. The owners are very nice. Big servings of delicious pork bone soup for $5.99 only. Grilled mackerel was superb for $2.99. The side dishes are very tasty and plentiful. They even sent out free fried pork dumplings. Will definitely go back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Had a really good meal here with a friend; we were both happy with our dishes and the starters.  Service was fast, the prices were good.  I can't ask for anything else when I've got a Korean hankering.  The decor is entirely lacking but when you have a face full of bibimbap it ceases to matter."}
{"text":"I'm not sure, but I think this place might have been closed down by Toronto city health inspectors.  There were several notices pasted on the door and the restaurant looked dark and empty.  Can anyone else confirm?  I was really looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"Its a shame the place hasn't opened since the fire on the second floor  a few months back.  The food here is A+. Flavourful and like 100+ dishes to choose from. My favourite is the gamjatang soup or the Korean BBQ plate which also included 4 beers.  The portions here are crazy big and the side dishes delicious. If you are a regular de wonderful owner will always greet you and send free appetizers.  The spot is always clean and organized and they have a very efficient service even when theres a rush and the restaurant is full.  I really hope they come back and open again!  Best of Luck!!!"}
{"text":"Came here Friday night with two friends, one of them Korean. She remarked that Koreans don't usually eat here, as they tend to eat at Ka Chi next door. Not the best sign, and indeed the customers that night were diverse, from students to businesspeople, but none of them were Korean.  We ordered the Gamjatang (based on previous reviews), Shrimp Fried Rice, Jap Chae, and Tteok Bokki. The Gamjatang was very good, with a lot of depth in flavour in the soup and potatoes, and the pork being super tender. The Jap Chae and Fried Rice were average Korean fast food fare, while the Tteok bokki was (like other ones I've tried in Toronto) too sweet for my tastes and not enough gochu spiciness. One of the highlights was the 6 banchan we got, which the servers would duly refill when requested.  Speaking of service, there were only 2 servers working that night, so it took awhile to get their attention and ask for llates, more tea and more banchan.  Overall good value for some Korean comfort food, all the dishes were approx $8 and the 3 of us left way too full."}
{"text":"When thinking Korean food one usually thinks Christie or the Yonge and Finch area.  So when you find one in a little nook of Chinatown, one does usually have reserved feelings.  Jang Su Chon though is one of the best little surprises I've found in the city.  Pros:   Quality of food is some of the best I've had in the city Very good prices Friendly service  Cons: Location a little hidden Washroom area a little icky  This place is located in a little street off of Spadina so at first, it's really hard to find if you don;t know where you're going.  It's also located right beside one of the more known Kachi locations.  I've been to Kachi several times and quite frankly, I like this place more.  We ordered the standard Gamjatang, the steamed marinated beef ribs and a Korean rice cake dish with Chicken.  Before you get anything you always get the standard set of Korean appetizers.  The appetizers were very well done.  When you go to a Korean restaurant, I believe if the place really puts a lot of detail into the side dishes, the main entrees will be even better.  Jang Su Chon definitely fits in the description.  Some of the better side dishes I've had in a while.  The Gamjatang here definitely ranks in the top three I have had in the city.  The broth is great, very rich.  It's also a bit spicier than most other Korean restaurants, which I love.  The pork bones were fall of the bone, I could eat them with my spoon.  They've definitely been slow cooked for a long time.  Another testament to the quality of food they have here.  The beef ribs were the same, very tasty and fall of the bone.  They don't cut corners here when it comes to cooking.  The prices were great too.  Gamjatang was only $5.99.  You're not going to find that price very often in Toronto at all.  The staff here are very friendly and courteous.  They were a but understaffed that the grandpa and grandma in the back had to come out to help out, but they really tried their best to make sure everyone was served promptly.  The staff speaks both Korean and Chinese which is a plus.  I was told the owner of the place used to have a restaurant in China but I can't confirm is that is true or not.  My only gripe about the place really is the washrooms.  They were located in the basement and at the time seemed to have a little flooding.  They have newspapers down to try and soak the water but it still made the footing slippery.  Pretty much what kept me from giving a 5 for this place.  Still not enough to deter me from coming back more in the future.  In conclusion, Jang Su Chon is definitely a place for Korean food lovers to try.  You won't be disappointed.  A Korean restaurant in Chinatown usually seems haphazard but this place definitely will make you think twice about that."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night at around 7pm, experience wasn't so great due to the long wait (maybe it was because a club at UofT chose to have a big club dinner at around the same time).  Service was unattentive and slow (server didn't refill our tea after taking away our empty teapot, I had to personally go up to the counter to ask for some).  However, the place was very clean, which I appreciated.   I'll try the place again, but for now it doesn't really impress."}
{"text":"My friends and I just had an amazing experience at this place last night. None of us are big fans of Ka Chi, and we had gone to Seo Rak San so many times that we wanted to try something new without having to trek over to Koreatown.   We decided to try Jan Su Chon and it was the best decision ever. We came hungry - stomach-gnawingly starved, actually. We seated ourselves and the server came over promptly to take our orders. Our side dishes were brought over right after we ordered, since we mentioned that we were super hungry and couldn't wait to eat.  They continued to refill side dishes whenever they noticed we were whittling them down, and we got 3 rounds of side dishes. They even gave us a dish of fried fish, complementary of the kitchen!   We ordered the seafood pancake, bi bim bop, deep fried chicken, dumpling soup, and spicy beef with rice cake (sorry, I forgot the actual name of the dish!). Everything was delicious, and they had already given us so much free food before our dishes arrived that we were very very comfortably stuffed, to say the least.   A kind old granny came over to ask us how we were enjoying the food halfway through the meal, and it was just adorable and perfect.   Nice touch: they overheard us commenting on our favourite side dish, and made sure to bring us extra orders of that side dish! Whoa!   Might I also note that it was 10pm on a Tuesday night, and there were quite a few tables still filled, so I'm glad to see that it's picking up steam in the months that it's been open.   Love this place, my new go-to Korean place downtown!"}
{"text":"I love Jang Su Chon, but a couple of months ago there was a fire on one of the upper floors where there were apparently some rooms rented (a man died, sadly).  It had nothing to do with the restaurant or its owners except the damage and the ensuing issues have so far resulted in no repairs.  I've gone back every couple of weeks to check, but while Ka Chi next door is up and running, Jang Su Chon is still OOC.    The owners are very sweet people and they had a great restaurant.  They would often bring unordered dishes for free. I wish them all the best and hopefully they will return soon.  Losing Jang Su Chon and Oishi Kada in Kensington Market within several months of each other is tough."}
{"text":"This place was great! My spicy chicken dish was delicious. They brought out tons of free appetizers, most of which were very good. Some, like the gelatine just aren't my taste, but I'm sure people who like that would think it's good. The kimchi, bean sprouts and cucumbers were great. Some things were a little bit salty for my liking, but I think most people wouldn't find it a problem. They served hot tea in beer pitchers which I find odd, but I've noticed a lot of Korean places in Toronto serve hot tea in some sort of unusual plastic container...  The service was good. I'm surprised it wasn't busier on a Friday night but they had a decent crowd.   I'll be going back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about here. The food is decent for sure but the Korean competition around the area is intense. The bibimgap is good but not as good as the competition. The stir fried beef noodles were okay. The pork bone soup was more flavourful than others but I still don't think it's worth it to come here for that. Lastly, the restaurant is way too cold."}
{"text":"every time I go to Jang Su Chon I am amazed at how everyone is packed into Ka Chi right next door while Jang Su Chon is practically empty. Jang Su Chon is in my opinion the best Korean restaurant in the city with some of the best prices as well and the Pork Bone Soup is the best I've ever had anywhere. Great service with amazing food at an amazing price, you really can't go wrong and I chuckle at the fools that are wasting their time eating right next door to greatness and paying more for it."}
