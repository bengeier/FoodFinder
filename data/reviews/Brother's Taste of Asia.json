{"text":"I have been a regular and loyal to Brothers for a number of years and it has come to the point where I have had enough.  First, the quality of food seems has dropped in the last 18 months. Cold dishes, far more batter then meat on fried items, etc.  Second, and most frustrating, is the service.  The owner has always had his own style which used to be fun, but now he's moved to simply rude.  Aggressive on the phone, rude in person and even more rude to female customers.  We have even received (more then once) a call because we took too long to pick up our food - and we are talking about arriving at 20 minutes when we are told 15-20 minutes.  Unfortunately our friends are all experiencing the same issues.  Disappointing, because we used to love the place."}
{"text":"When I read the previous review from Peter H., I became a little worried as I too had been going to Brother's on and off again for a while, and unfortunately he was right about the service.  The owner has gone from being funny to completely rude! It was so bizarre, I am at a loss to explain.  Thankfully, I thought that the food was the same high quality as before, however, I won't be dining in anytime soon."}
{"text":"Compared to others, we've always received great service and quality of food.  We consantly go there and never have been displeased.   Yes, the manager may be very loud and abrupt. But I think that could be his style. I guess everyone is different. I wouldn't discount the experience of other reviews. We have never had any issues at Brothers'. Hopefully, we never will."}
{"text":"Make sure you order an hour and a half before you want to have dinner. Never believe the 30 to an hour estimate they give you over the phone coz they are LYING!!! The food is okay but I am not sure it is worth the hour and a half wait. I will be avoiding this restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been going to Brother's since it opened.  We have their Chinese food every two weeks.  In the last year, not only have they gotten more expensive, the quality of food has gone downhill.  Last night we ordered take out.  The shrimp fried rice was tasteless, no seasoning., shrimp overcooked.  The spare ribs with honey and garlic...AWFUL!   The dish doesn't have a spare rib in sight.  It's deep fried dry ribs soaked in syrup.  That's right...dry ribs like you get in a pub.  No honey and no garlic, just a 1/2 inch of pure syrup on the bottom of the container....for $15.00.    The sweet and sour soup, mixed veggies were good.  Definitely open to suggestions for a new Chinese restaurant in the SW Evergeen area."}
{"text":"They are more expensive than other restaurants around. Not sure if the premium is worth it but the food is okay.. I don't like the fact that their given wait estimates are almost never accurate. There were several times I was told food will be ready for pickup in 30 minutes and once I arrived to pickup the food I was told it was not ready and I had to wait, sometimes for upwards of another 30 minutes. I suggest you check the food before picking up as well as there were several occasions where I ordered \"Steamed Chicken with vegetables\" but instead I got mostly steamed vegetables with \"some\" chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent. Our place to go for takeout. The older Asian guy is a little intense - kinda like the soup guy off Sinefeld. He should leave the job to the other staff and go behind the scenes. Other than that, perfect, excellent food"}
{"text":"I've never eaten in the restaurant so I can't speak to the issues the other reviewers have mentioned. However I've been ordering take out from this location for a couple years now and it's always delicious. Price seems comparable to other take out options, and we've never had an issue with delivery times.  I've enjoyed the food so much that I often order when we have company. Portion sizes are great, and we always have left overs."}
{"text":"Horrible Food, Owner( manager) supper mean to employees and SUPER loud. NEVER going back again."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. The plates are huge. My husband and I shared a ginger beef and chicken fried rice, and we had left overs!! We came all the way from Arizona and this was on my husbands, must go's! For good reason :) thanks Brothers."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly behaviors of the person. We went 1 hr prior to closing time at lunch, the person was more interested in closing his place on time then to serve us. He said its closing in 1 hr order quickly and pressured us to take out. Food was also not so good. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I'm just going to let everyone know you should probably just get take out. The dining area is poorly laid out .Every time I am waiting for pick up I am pretty much left awkwardly hanging out beside someone's table because there's not much room to wait around inside . The food is good and I order there probably once every 3 months. The chicks at the counter are decent and are always pretty nice . Do it ."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not a fan of Chinese food in general so when I go to Chinese places, I eat very little.  The food I did have here was very good and I had no problems with it.  Let's talk about the manager/waiter... It's gonna be hit and miss. Either your gonna find him a major pain in the ass or your gonna love him. He didn't ever cross the line with my family, and we enjoyed him. I could see how he could be annoying and throw your opinion off however."}
{"text":"The previous reviewer nailed this one. The place is clean and the dining area is nicely set up but the owner who is also the waiter is an enormous asshat.  Loud, rude, standoffish and uninviting.  The food was on the expensive side and I'd give it a 3/5 for taste.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant, we go here a lot. The food is authentic and the service was excellent. The atmosphere was really alive and the service was fast. I would recommend this."}
{"text":"Food is rather bland. Chicken from the pineapple sweet and sour dish tasted like it could have been fried for a longer period of time...Kind of chewy, there's also giant chunks of tomato in this dish?? That's just weird and gross. Also, more expensive than our usual Chinese go-to, Yummy Yummy...And mostly the same listed items. Only reason I ordered from here is that they are actually open for lunch."}
