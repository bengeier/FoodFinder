{"text":"Rather disappointing buffalo Mac 'n' Cheese. The sauce was not creamy, but rather liquid with islands of gooeyness. Not particularly cheesy flavour either. Pasta and chicken cooked fine, normal hot sauce. Not inedible, but not worth the price and defies normal Mac and Cheese expectations."}
{"text":"Had the Poutine and Mac Bites and 2 drinks.  Disappointed that the fries were like the Costco fries (coated & from the freezer isle), I was expecting fresh cut fries and more cheese.  The MAC Bites outer crust was burnt and overly seasoned that you could not taste the mac n cheese people rave about.  I was expecting a better product for the price."}
{"text":"Great comfort food, cheesy sauce and a smiling crew. I stopped by for the classic Mac and bites while they're downtown. Great lunch."}
