{"text":"Great store!  This is also a post office where all the locals have their PO boxes, so you are sure to bump into people knowledgeable about the local area.  There is also a beautiful pot bellied stove in the corner of the post office area.  Lots of books & magazines available on a take one leave one basis.  There is also a liquor store and grocery area.  The deli is really good with lots of choices of sandwiches, soups and to die for raspberry oatmeal bars.  Choice of good coffee too.  Eat ice-cream on the sunny deck in the Summer.  Look for locally made jewelry by the check out counter."}
{"text":"this is a cool place and the only in town...unfortunately we stopped there this past weekend while camping in the area to find they charge $5.00+ for a 10 lb. bag of ice...a bag of ice and a 20 oz bottle of Diet Pepsi cost us $7.50...when asked if this was correct the response was \"yes you aren't just paying for the ice, you are paying for the gas to get it here\"...meanwhile 20 miles away in Steamboat Springs you can pay a normal price for a bag of ice...don't insult my intelligence, you are gouging tourists...and in this case Colorado residents...pretty weak..."}
{"text":"The Clark Store is awesome! I've stopped by several times over the last few years and it has definitely improved A LOT. The breakfast selection is great and affordable for some really quality food. The bacon is amazing, as is the granola that comes with the yogurt, fruit and granola. Yum! Sandwiches are equally delicious and really filling - I've had the turkey, club, and veggie panini. All were amazing, and this is coming from a city girl surrounded by incredible delis and restaurants. They also have some great Colorado souvenirs and a nice little selection of outdoor gear, which was really impressive given that it's a bit out in the middle of nowhere. I'd definitely recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"Had a lunch here which was very good. Meatloaf sandwich, potato salad. Unique little store and restaurant. Only service food from 0630 till 1500.  Stopped by another morning for a breakfast burrito. It was huge and very good.  This isn't a fast food place, so slow down and enjoy the place. Remember you're on Steamboat time."}
{"text":"Going camping in the area of Steamboat Lake or Hahn's Peak?  No need to worry because you forgot something.  The Clark Store is a wonderful last stop for an ingredient or two that you may have forgotten to pack.  Their liquor store and selection is unexpectedly good, and the prices surprisingly low.  The sandwiches at the deli are excellent and use homemade ingredients.  This was a very pleasant surprise, and very welcome discovery."}
{"text":"This store is the town of Clark.  If you are traveling through the area, you need to stop by The Clark Store just to experience.  It has all the essentials wrapped up into one location.  You have the grocery store, the restaurant, the liquor store, the post office, the coffee shop and the ice cream parlor all in one.  The grocery store and the liquor store have different cash registers, but the same person runs them, it is true country living.  We stopped to get something to drink and an ice cream.  The ice cream is out on the back porch with chairs and tables to sit at.  I got the huckleberry ice cream which was enjoyable and a good chance to sit down and just relax."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had (prime rib). Perfect nostalgic place for lunch or ice cream on your way back from the mountains. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Love stopping at the Clark Store, whether its for coffee, check the library or wine store, have an ice cream on the deck in summer, or just for the feeling you get that this may be the last stop in civilization before heading off in to the wilds... even if the next stop is just down the road for fudge at Steamboat Lake Marina. Doesn't matter; always a warm hello, and a good buy!"}
{"text":"When The Clark Store went under new management I was a bit wary of the change.  As The Clark Store has always been about its role in the community and served as an outpost for the tired traveler or dehydrated biker, not The Wild Ones kind, but those pedel jockeys who like locas swarm the county roads from spring to fall.  The Clark Store is now even better! Serving fresh salads and amazing food it has expanded its menu and vastly improved its quality of food."}
{"text":"When: July 4, 2014  This place is almost always packed, however my family and I made it in right before the mad rush of people made it to the outskirts of town where we were.  First we stopped off and had some ice cream. LOVELY.  We all got something different. Chocolate/coffee/huckleberry/black cherry vanilla. I wish I could be some help as to what would be the best for you to get. I can't, they were all amazing. When you go, slip down the stairs and sit beneath the shade of the trees to the picnic tables. It's a beautiful way to enjoy a summer afternoon!  Then we went into the store for some quick shopping. They had everything we needed cinnamon rolls, bacon, eggs, bread, hot dogs and buns, chips, etc. We stocked up our shelves for the upcoming weekend and had a great conversation with the man at the register. Very nice man, talked my ear off about the upcoming events in town (Fireworks, rodeo, Big Head Todd's free concert and everything in between).   The prices are higher than they were in town, but for the convenience. I'll pay it!  My husband did swing in and grab a hot dog... that was really good! The bread is perfect and the large all beef hot dog is perfect for an afternoon lunch!"}
{"text":"The Clark store is the absolute BEST! My friends and I stop in all the time when we are heading up north! Perfect stop for the days breakfast, lunch or a coffee before the trailhead. The Meatloaf sandwich is to die for. This store has anything you could need. Hot, cold or any type of food you could want, camping gear, fishing gear, personal care, trinkets. The Clark store has such a friendly, happy, helping energy, right when you walk in. The Clark store even made my wife and I's wedding pies. Everybody loved all the different flavors, they were very tasty. They took perfect care of us, even for having 150+ people they still took on the job! We couldn't have asked for more. Keep it up Clark store!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when my boyfriend and I decided to have lunch at the Clark Store this weekend. We were staying at a friend's home in Clark and we needed some food without having to go too far. My boyfriend and I split two sandwiches, the pastrami and the caprese (with bacon added). We also got cups of the beef chuck chili. All of the food was delicious; my favorite sandwich was the pastrami. The homemade beef chuck chili was great.   We sat in a booth that overlooked the mountains, which added to the experience. We also purchased a few items, like a camping cutlery kit and postcards. Unfortunately, a few things are a bit expensive in the store, but that's what you can expect from a town store out in the country.   They have a liquor store with a decent selection, various groceries, a post office, and a mini-library.   We will definitely return next time we are in Clark for some yummy sandwiches!"}
