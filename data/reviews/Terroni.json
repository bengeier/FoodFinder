{"text":"So lately I've been on a bit of an Italian kick. Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.
 
The camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. 

While (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). 

As for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  
  
Regardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. 

Our waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  

We started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. 
 
We chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.
 
No sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. 

Now when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.  Once again, as with the sharing, social norms seem to get in the way..."}
{"text":"Use to come here all the time and loved it! 

Service needs a little work but more importantly lets get to the food reviews 

Starting with my personal favorite...

Ravioli di Zio Paperone -Great 
homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano

Tonnarelli alla Norcina - Good 
Italian black truffle shavings, homemade spicy sausage, pecorino 


Tagliatelle alla Bolognese- Great 
traditional bolognese ragù, parmigiano 



Tonnarelli ai Funghi - Good 
oyster and honey mushrooms, porcini sauce 


Cavatelli al Ragu' D'Agnello -Great 
handmade cavatelli, lamb braised in tomato sauce, Pecorino 


Gnocchi alla Simi- Good

Rigatoni Arcobaleno - Good 
mozzarella di bufala, zucchini, light cherry tomato sauce, basil

Only one I have tried is Caprese and it was Good. 


Pizze - Pizza 

They are well done thin crusts .... I personally like Napoli, Margherita, Bufalina, Quattro Stagioni, Santo Stefano, Da Dó a Dá, Smendozzata, Li Pecuri, and finally C't Mang. 


Dessert ... I always get a flourless chocolate cake heated .... It's a perfect finish for my dinner with a cappuccino or latte"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp about this location, I was a bit skeptical, but checked it out anyway... I'm glad the lower rating didn't scare me off, 'cause this was one of the best thin-crusted pizzas I've ever had! 

One thing - the beer list could have been better, but I suppose you're supposed to drink wine at these places anyway."}
{"text":"Not baby friendly anymore. 

Refused service for having an urban sized stroller due to \"fire hazards\" when the restaurant at 2:30 pm was almost empty."}
{"text":"Good food, somewhat traditional Italian but very tasty.  Gets a little camped in this place so reservations are definitely best."}
{"text":"GREAT atmosphere! You will fall in love with this place before ordering any food! 
The service is amazing as well! (Except in the end, we have to ask three different servers to get the bill)
The three of us ordered appetizer, salad, seafood pasta and pizza. To be honest, I had better pizza and pasta in other Italian restaurants, but the calamari appetizer is pretty great!"}
{"text":"I've always had pretty good service at both Terroni locations.  In fact, my favorite server from Sweet Lulu on Queen West turned up at the Adelaide Street location.  He is wonderful.  And the servers really know the menu, including the wine list. I've always been impressed. 

I live just around the corner from Terroni on Queen and I always marvel at the line-ups when there are so many other good choices within a few blocks.  I end up there every once in a while because friends want to go, or because we want to go somewhere kid friendly with our two year old.  I have to hand it to them--they are really accommodating of kids.  They don't bat an eyelash when you come in with a stroller and ask for a high chair.  The only rudeness I've experienced is from the patrons waiting in line, who seem really put out when they need to move six inches so I can get out the door.  

The food has always been good, sometimes fantastic.  I've never had anything terrible, but last night I had a just ok dish for the first time: the spaghetti alla norma.  The pasta was perfectly al dente as always, but the tomato sauce lacked flavor and the chunks of deep fried eggplant were soggy and bland.  I started with the giuggiolosa salad, which was wonderful and kept the meal from being a loss.  

The pizzas are really tasty, and the spaghetti with lemon and capers is one of my favorites.  The pasta portions are pretty small for the money, I find.  They are just the right size, if you ask me, compared to the monstrous portions at other places, but $16 or so for a small portion of vegetarian pasta seems excessive to me.  

My biggest peeve is that the salads are all just shy of entree size, which means too large to be starters, but at entree salad prices.  It feels indulgent (and it is expensive) to get a salad and a pasta, but pasta alone isn't enough veg for me, and a salad alone isn't filling enough.

Actually, that's my second biggest pet peeve.  My biggest is the little note on the menu that says, \"While alterations may seem easily accommodated they compromise the unique characteristics of our food.  Please respect our menu.\"  I find that really obnoxious.  

I'm sure I'll be back, not even kicking and screaming, but it just doesn't live up to the hype for me."}
{"text":"Still one of the best places for pizza. Consistent quality and service.  I don't usually order pasta because I'm extra picky, but they know how to cook pasta.  Al dente and delicious. 
They are always busy for a reason."}
{"text":"Firstly, the food here is very good.

BUT. The service is very poor. Not a friendly member of staff in sight. They do a good job at serving but without a smile and this is consistent with Terronis across Toronto.  Hosting etc is so poor. They chat with themselves while barely acknowledging the customers. 

Let's face it, they're serving Pizza and Pasta. Not rocket science. 

I guess the joke is on the consumer as this place was absolutely packed on a Wednesday night.

Give your money to a less arrogant establishment. This place is so close to being outstanding. They ruin it for themselves in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food was good, however it was the worst service I ever received in a North American restaurant. I'm so surprised. Everything we asked for seemed to bother the waitress. It was so bad I came to make my first yelp comment. I'd be willing to try another one of their locations since the food was good."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better is definitely an accurate representation of how I felt after my recent visit to Terroni.  It was ok, but for the price, Grazie at Yonge and Eglinton is much better!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about. Why are people waiting in long lines to eat here. Lest start with the inefficient host, there were two tables open and she only realized that after thirty minutes of waiting. The waiter was nice but rushed. He didn't even read out the specials. The calamari was liked chewing on rubber, the ravioli a little too 'al dente', the coffee cold. I might still go there for average food but I expected more for the price I paid. My advice, save your money and go to Bellini instead."}
{"text":"Patio and Porterhouse! Shared the Porterhouse steak with two others, twas fantastico! Arrived with fingerling potatoes, grilled veggies and mucho grande salad which was enough for all three grown fellas. Topped with a bottle of vino the meal was complete. Good service no issues. Make sure you got a reservation during the busy lunch and dinner hrs."}
{"text":"Things I really liked:
-The extensive (non lcbo/direct import) wine list sorted by region
-in house scratch made everything
-size of restaurant allowed for easy reso

Other comments:
Service was satisfactory
Food was slightly above average
Front of house staff below average

This is more of a fun upbeat place versus cozy and romantic 
Great for a group not as much for an intimate date"}
{"text":"Love it love it love it.  We had our wedding dinner in the room in the basement (where the old jailhouse cells are) and the ambience is fantastic.  The food is really, really good and they were so accomodating, an absolute pleasure to deal with.  Everyone loved it and couldn't stop raving about it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Wonderful vegetarian, vegan and gulten free options. In fact they have a separate menu for all gulten free folks. Lots of options, a must place to visit!"}
{"text":"My favourite Italian place! Amazing food, service, atmosphere. Pizzas came in 8 minutes after we ordered them!!! Servers are always happy and cherry and nice and helpful. The pizza was outstanding as usual, perfect thickness, not too greasy, yummy crust and love all the pizzas to choose from. Defiantly I would reccomend Terroni to anyone who asks!!"}
{"text":"We have been there on Sunday .service was good but food was horrible.
We did order fried calamari and raw meat as appetizer after we did have flank steak.
Portion were so small. Both the calamari and the steak were horrible .they were so hard and difficult to swallow. As if you have 10 chewing gum at once inside  your mouth. Even after cutting it to small tiny pcs still difficult to swallow.
Prices were more than average comparable restaurants.
Never again"}
{"text":"We went for the pizza because it came highly recommended. Space, service, ambience were fine but nothing special. The pizza is excellent, not quite the best we've had, but pretty close. Desert was ordinary. Only Toronto pizza we had on our trip, so we can't compare it to others, but Terroni's is certainly respectable."}
{"text":"I love Terroni restaurants, but this is one location I will not be returning to.

A group of 20 of us got there at 6pm ahead of the dinner rush. It took two hours for our food to be served - many of the meals were not even hot and the quality was not worth the $100 I paid for my partner's and my dinner. There was no effort to apologize or compensate the table and the automatic 20% gratuity did not reflect the sub-standard service. Even if they could have just brought bread again sometime in that second hour, I might have given them a 2/5."}
{"text":"I always go to Terroni when I want to have the best pizza and the best costumer service. I recommend it to the people who wants eat a very good Italian food."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten at the bar and I find the service to be pretty good, actually.  Really good wine to chose from.  And I like their menu.  I got cheesed off that they won't alter any menu items but I GET IT.  It's not my restaurant so I DON'T GET TO CHOOSE THE RULES.  
And they probably don't want whiney vegans drinking hot water dining there anyway.  It's a business and you cant make money off of hot water and tempeh, kids. So suck it up and go to a VEGAN restaurant.  Or, get over yourself and enjoy a good bolognese.  You won't regret it.  And, btw, it's not that expensive.  Terroni Adelaide is more chi-chi.  Good date place."}
{"text":"I've loved Terroni from the first time I went there years ago. A favourite is the Funghi Salad as a starter, though I have had that alone as a light lunch. The menu is a fairy simple affair, but the empahasis is on more authentica nd somewhat rustic fare -- which suits me tine.

I've heard grumblings about their inflexible olicies regarding the cutting of pizzas and of substutions, but I really don't thisnk it has effected their business at all since it's always packed.

I've also been to their other branches, and love that each one is different in feel and menu. Terroni has seen itself eclipsed somewhat by Libretto in terms of pizza, but honestly I still prefer Terroni for it's overall ambiance and stick-to-it's-guns ideas about serving methods.

I know when they opened in LA they had to endure some scathing critcism from Americans who feel  that sunstitutions should be allowed on everything....but they seem to have prevailed nonetheless"}
{"text":"Ah the original! This is the reason why I'm a fan of this establishment but I no longer visit for the same reason.  It's got great pizza but the place is just too cramped when I can get into their other places (closer and more spacious) and the service is the same which is where I knock off a point.  I've placed my review where I normally visit (Adelaide St. court house) though I was more frequent eater at their Victoria St. location (now Osteria) before they moved.  The main difference between this location is the decor... more authentic small Italian style eatery but the food is just as good at their other locations so go where it's convenient.  The San Giorgio is a great meat pizza and my fave but line ups are the same and you'll likely suffer the same service.  There is no half star ratings so I'm indicating this is really a 3.5 star (5 for pizza, 3 for decor and 3 for service here)"}
{"text":"I first ate at their original location on Queen Street West back in the mid 1990's when it was and still is a small tiny hole in the wall.  I must admit that I love pizza but for health reasons I limit my intake to less than once a month consumption.  I also like pasta but can't say I'm a connoisseur as I'm Asian and have both bias plus preference for Asian over Italian style noodles. When they opened up on Victoria St. (currently their Osteria location), it was much closer to home and work for me and my friends so it was great! The food at Terroni's is very good and the decor/ambiance is great but where they lose points is the service.  They're polite at best and at their worst, they're pretentious, too busy to smile or rude.  

As a pizza lover, I prefer thin crust over thick dough any day.  Terroni makes good pizza but the one that meat lovers (like me) seem to like is the San Giorgio.  The meat does have a bit of spice and it will make you thirsty so keep some drinks around.  I've had the opportunity to sample almost all their pizzas over the years as one time we went as a group and we probably sampled every pizza but I've stuck to my favourite over the years.  One suggestion I do have is do not have the salmon pizza unless you like your fish baked dry so save the salmon for sushi.  I've also tried their Tagliolini in Canna a Mare which is one of their more expensive seafood pastas.  It's not bad but again I may not be the best judge for this category.

Since moving around the corner, I haven't frequented the court house location as it's a bit further I did have one bad experience at the new location which may have turned me off.  I came with 2 friends when they first re-located to Adelaide St. and we waited a long time to get seated.  Then I promptly ordered my San Giorgio pizza and it came fast as did my friend's... almost too fast.  When a place is packed, there is no way they could have made 3 pizzas unless the dough was ready made and refrigerated.  It tasted chewy and definitely not fresh like usual so I'm speculating they do this when it gets really busy like on a Friday or Saturday night.  I have been back since during lunch and on weekday evenings to avoid line ups and the quality seems fine so I'm pleased (last visited in mid-August 2010).  Overall, a 3.5 plus rating which is 4.5 for food/decor and 2.5 for service."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Best pasta I have ever tasted. Nice atmosphere. Big bill."}
{"text":"My friend ordered the Spaghetti Ca' Pummarola N'Goppa and I had the Pizza Cosi.

My pizza tasted good, I really liked the porcini mushrooms and the taste of the crust. My friend's Spaghetti, unfortunately, was ridiculously salty and his pasta was undercooked. Like... so tough to chew it was stuck in your teeth. 

On top of this service was terrible. We were seated by the hostess right by the hostess terminal (at the long table) and didn't even receive water or have our orders taken until we had asked TWICE for our waitress to be sent over. Four wait staff for the entire restaurant is unacceptable. So the service wasn't really the fault of the waitress, she was attentive and came by often to refill water and check up on us. 

Definitely won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Toronto. I will dream of the tagliatelle bolognese until I can return! Amazing service, beautiful decor and atmosphere, just perfect! The food is unbelievable, the quality and freshness of Italy with reasonable prices. Delicious!!! Try the meat and cheese starter with dried pear and honey, to die for!!!! I can't wait to go back!!!!:)"}
{"text":"The ambiance was very cool. A lot like John's Pizza near Time's Square in NYC. Hip and casual in a beautifully renovated old building. The service was also very good. Ordered the calamari as an app which was done perfectly. I was a little disappointed in the limited beer selection. I like to have a nice IPA with a pizza, but there were none on the menu. I ordered a scotch on the rocks instead which was 1.000 shot (sip) of Glenfiddich that barely spanned the bottom of the tumbler for $10. Where I come from, a scotch on the rocks is a GLASS OF SCOTCH ON THE ROCKS. I digress... The pizza was good but did not live up to the rave reviews. The crust was not as crispy as you would expect from a wood-fired pizza but all-in-all not too bad."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner to celebrate a friends wedding. They had a special menu prepared for the group of us. Calamari was great, there was also a mushroom arugula salad that everyone loved.. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of mushrooms so did not try it. The pasta was one of the best that I have had! It was freshly made and prepared in house.

Service was good but not just average... Overall I would for sure want to come back."}
{"text":"One of the best - perhaps the best - rooftop patios in Toronto.

Never been before at this Terroni, went on the rooftop opening day.

A great place with full moon, on a warm night. Very nice experience.

Music was good, place is equally interesting as a restaurant or a full bar.
Overall the vibe of the place was great.
All the dishes I tried were very good - wouldn't rate them excellent tough.
Some interesting cocktails to accompany your summer nights.

Prices were a bit spicy.

Service was helpful - some times not looking for customers but hope it was due to the opening day - and always with a smile.

Again, the rooftop is this place's asset.

PS - Summer is the only period were smokers don't have to feel as outcasts and can enjoy a drink with their friends. Was very disappointed that there was no space for smoking in this huge open patio and had to go all the way down the stairs, to the street."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I had the branzino, two small fillets, I mean super thin and small for 30 bucks. Ridiculous for this price, and it was under seasoned. Caprese salad was 14 bucks and the buffalo mozzarella tasted like cheap mozzarella balls. The good stuff is way tastier! Didnt offer sangria year round which makes me angry... dessert was amazing. Crossaint stuffed with noiciolla gelato, nutella and whip. Over priced for ok food."}
{"text":"The food was average for Italian fare and over priced. Small portions for pasta. The desert was the best part of the meal- the nutell fritters with gelatto was phenominal! The service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I don't really see the rave about this restaurant. Everyime I drive by Terroni's, the restaurant always seems to be packed with people lining up to get a table. I think this restaurant is sooo over-rated. The food isn't even good for people to actually be eating here!! I've been here twice since my first experience with their pasta was horrid I was hoping maybe a second try at their pizza would change my mind. Oh boy was i ever wrong! Their pizza sucked as much as their pasta! First of all when i tried the pasta, the noodles were definetly not properly cooked! it was still hard, cold and chewy when i got it! it was disgusting! The sauce from the seafood pasta was soo bland and tastless! The ravaoli I tried from my mother's was so dry!! The serving sizes were also VERY tiny for a $20 meal which was totally not worth it! Compared to their pizza, it was just as bad! There were hardly any toppings on it! I was basically served tomato sauce on a bread crust with crumbs of vegetables and meat! This was NOT pizza at all! The crust was so soggy and not crispy cause it was flooded by the tomato sauce! Only good thing i could say about them is their desserts (tiramisu, creme caramel) DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT PASTA/PIZZA! I GURANTEE YOU IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!
If you want good authentic Italian pasta/pizza, try John's Italian Cafe in the Baldwin Area! Incredible food thats actually worth your money!!"}
{"text":"Generally i go to their summerhill location. Adelaide location food was consistent, which is awesome. And wine list is very good. 
Negatives of my recent experience is even though the staff is friendly, I felt rushed. Being rushed is an insult to good food. i was asked in short succession by two staff if I was done eating. Seriously, just because I wasn't wolfing down my pizza and enjoyed stopping to breathe, drink my wine and talk doesn't mean I'm done my meal. They should train their staff to recognise cutlery positions. The ambiance could have been better. The \"decorative\" courthouse dummies hanging along the wall in my opinion are in bad taste, and the music playing was interrupted in the middle of a song with a deafening humm. I imagine it was the DJ setting up. I'll avoid going here again and stick to the summerhill location."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick dinner after shopping along Queen West. The patio is beautiful, but simple. The food is similarly so. I've never strayed from the pizza, which maybe means I need to go back more often. Yes. Yes."}
{"text":"both my friend and I each got a plate of Carpaccio and the cut had an amazing smooth texture that had me sold - no complaints.

The two of us then shared a pasta that I felt was way over priced for something I could make myself.

All the wines are also terribly expensive for mediocre taste that came in low wine glasses that lacked class.

Bread was decent, but they only served olive oil and no balsamic.

All in all, for an $80+ bill I only liked the Carpaccio."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great ambience and delicious food. I have been several times and I am never disappointed. The seafood pasta is great, as well as the Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo plate and the thin crust pizza. My favourite salad is the Giuggiolosa, I have to get it every time! 

I am always happy with the service! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I will never again go to this Terroni locaton. It's my own fault. I take full responsibility for deciding to eat here on a Saturday night. Thankfully my favourite clothing store, Charlie, is right across the street. I was able to kill 15 of my 35 minute wait looking at all the adorable Spring clothes.  I am not sure of why i would accept a bottle of cold red wine for our table. I suppose I was desperate for a drink at that point, in hindsight I should have refused it. But seriously, what were they thinking?  As I made my way through the underwhelming  Budino de Caramello I wondered if this dessert offering appears on the menu at their LA location and what Nancy Silverton thinks of that. Do yourself a favour and head over to the Adelaide location if you are desperate for Italian on a Saturday night, or better yet, try La Bruschetta on St. Clair."}
{"text":"Great for brunch - Try the Pandolci!

Went this past Saturday for brunch - was expecting it to be packed, but the bistro downstairs (Bar Centrale) had a few tables available. Service was very quick, and the food was excellent. She had a Frittata with salmon; I had the pork belly with poached egg served on navy beans. Not what I would typically order at all, but it was delicious. The piece de resistance was the Pandolci. I had been looking forward to indulging in these Scandinavian pancakes for months (as my girlfriend and I had made these plans months in advance). Well worth the wait. Prices seemed very reasonable, and we had a great table by the window. 

I will definitely be returning, especially to enjoy the wine bar upstairs!"}
{"text":"A good Italian restaurant. Comes off as pretentious, the food is good but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere is great, not for a romantic date, but good for a night out with friends. Skip the pastas and go for the pizzas. Service is usually good."}
{"text":"If you like simple and refreshing homemade Itallian cuisine, Terroni is the place for you. (this location) The staff are friendly and the ambience is quite nice. More quiet in the afternoon, gets noisy at dinner time, which is common for restaurants. Their pasta, pizza and cheese/meat platter are yummy. If you have a sweet tooth like me, you gotta try their panna cotta! To me it has the most right flavour and texture..."}
{"text":"Being a former court house, the decor of this place is amazing. It's like a baby of an interior designer and Italian chef. Unfortunately we did not have a good time here. It was dinner time, we understand it's busy but the noise was through the roof. At the same time, service had hit rock bottom. It took 30 minutes for the waiter to come get our order and another 1 hour and 30 minutes to get our food. The table beside us changed 3 times while we were there. Food was not freshly made at all. Compare to the Queen St. location, my husband and I were utterly disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely not customer first. Retarded BYOB policy. You cannot bring wines as gifts or a birthday cake for dessert. I don't mind being charged a corkage fee and even that is not possible. Even 3 star Michelin restaurants in NYC allow corkage fees!! Seriously terrible customer service  - even before I taste the food. It is definitely not worth considering!!


Post-dinner review:
Food was way overly greasy. My spaghetti chitarra had about 1 cm thick layer of oil - possibly from the spicy italian sausage. The absurd amount of oil and grease in their dishes gave me and my friends (we were a table of 7) diarrhoea about 1 hour after dinner and even on the next day. 

I simply cannot believe this low standard of cooking is allowed to leave the kitchen at all. Yes, surely the charming casual interior design almost forgives poorly executed cuisine - but look, we are here for the food not to admire artwork or interior decor. 

Terrible food compounded with terrible customer service definitely leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. I'm taking my family, friends and business clients away from the entire Terroni chain from now on - and I urge everyone to do the same"}
{"text":"Terroni has multiple locations, the one I frequent is located on Adelaide. I have been here a handful of times and will continue to visit in the future, in fact, I still have an unused gift card sitting around somewhere at home. Terroni, like most restaurants in the Financial District, has tasteful decor and great ambiance. In terms of seating, I suggest asking NOT to sit at the long table right by the entrance. We were sat here on one of my previous visits, when we were entertaining American colleagues. With the door constantly opening and closing and patrons having to walk past your table to get to the hostess, it is quite an interruption to your meal. Not my cup of tea.

In terms of food for this particular visit, we ordered off the seasonal menu, mostly summery BBQ items. We had the grilled sword fish, lightly breaded shrimp, vegetarian pizza topped with mozzarella, sun-dried tomato, arugula and parmigiano, and stuffed zucchini flowers with meaty croquettes. For dessert, we had their panna cotta, which I order on every single visit without fail. Not much else to say. Terroni has solid food and a it's pretty good place to bring out-of-town visitors.

Please come and check out my food blog for more pictures on Terroni and other Toronto restaurants? Pretty please with a cherry on top? :)

{"text":"The beef-cheek special simply incredible! Not too expensive either.  I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Period. Lovely patio for al fresco dining in warmer months. No reservations : ( Service is usually quite good, although there is one gal with attitude we try to avoid. Dining room is noisy with a warm and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's not often that I go to a restaurant and end up leaving feeling both appalled and content at the same time.

Let's breakdown the pros and cons of this place.

Pros: Comfortable seating, perfect lighting, wide selection of fresh pastas, pizzas and wines. 

Our table of 3 ordered the following dishes (sharing is caring!):

Beef Brisket Ragu ($18.95) - Had ample amounts of brisket, mushrooms, and onions tossed with fresh pasta. Though the pasta was done perfectly and the brisket was fork tender, the dish in whole could have used more sauce (but then again I am a sauce freak).

Lasagna Bolognese ($17.50) - The lasagna was just perfect. Perfectly cooked fresh pasta noodles smothered in layers of meat and bechamel. Everything was in proportion to one another and held together nicely for the perfect bite.

Scattagengive pizza ($17.95) - Topped with a fresh and light marinara sauce, mozzarella, spicy cacciatore salami and spicy provolone cheese. Delicious. Beware though, if you are looking for a sweat inducing/vision blurring kind of spiciness, then you should look elsewhere. I can only tolerate the spice level appropriate for a 4 year old toddler, but I was actually able to eat this pizza without breaking a sweat. The toppings were evenly distributed and the flavours were well balanced. Oh yeah and lets not forget about the pizza crust. It was fantastic and had a great mouthfeel (crispy and chewy).

Al Salmone pizza ($18.95) - This pizza was topped with mozzarella, italian cream, capers, red onions, fresh tomatoes and cold smoked salmon. Anybody who is a fan of smoked salmon just knows you can't go wrong with the combination of these ingredients. I wasn't disappointed with this at all. It was well-prepared and had just the right amount of everything. I did note that the crust was more crispy (and as a result more dry) than the other pizza as the crust was baked on it's own first then layered with the raw ingredients (onions, tomatoes and smoked salmon).

Cons: Really our only beef with this place was our server, Carmela. She was just completely inattentive and ignored us every chance she got. 

Upon being seated, we were only provided with the menu and left alone. No explanation of the menu specials, no wine recommendations, no nothing. We did eventually get water. We finally figured out what we wanted to order, but she was otherwise preoccupied with whatever she was doing. Eventually we managed to get her attention and after our last order, she promptly left again without giving us another second to even ask her about the wine list. She was gone. Correct me if i'm wrong, but I thought in restaurants the staff are always urged to \"sell\" the alcohol, whenever possible? Apparently our server didn't care, she was perfectly fine with us just drinking our free water. In any case, we had just finished work and a glass of wine was in order so we finally waved her down after 10 minutes. As soon as she gave us the wine list and reluctantly answered our question about the wine she was gone again.

I'm not sure what we did to this server, but she seemed much better with the other tables. Throughout our entire meal, she did not even come over once to ask how our meal was. Now, i'm not asking for a red carpet to be rolled out at my request or for rose petals to be thrown at my feet as I enter the restaurant, but I do expect the same service that is being provided to the rest of the other paying customers. 

The only bright spot in the service was from our waiter, he served us our food promptly and was even kind enough to get us some chili oil and bread. He was actually the only reason that the restaurant even saw a tip from us.

So basically, this would have been a 4-star (maybe even 5) experience had the service been on par with the food. The food and ambiance was excellent, but our server, Carmela, needs a total attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Mmm...almost bringing me back to Italy.

I've been to the now closed Victoria location a couple of times and finally made my way to the Adelaide location.  The front of the restaurant if pretty interesting - a bar, few tables and part of a wall has cured pork legs hanging (mmm, proscuitto anyone?) like the restaurants in Europe.
At first the hostess sat us in the section that's close to the kitchen but then came back about a minute later asking if we preferred a \"quieter\" section (I was with my boyfriend).  We accepted and were taken across the room to the tables at the other end.  It wasn't that much quieter (it's a loud restaurant in general) but it's the thought that counts, right? 
The seating is tight, so I found it hard not to catch pieces (and sometimes, large chunks) of the conversation from the tables around us.   I wonder what they thought about our conversation? We kept it PG13. :P 

Anyway, the food:
App - Tagliere de Salumiere - selection of italian and local cured meats. How could I resist with the fresh proscuitto (as fresh as cured meats could be, I guess) with the cured pork legs in the front?
This app is probably enough for 3 people.  It was good.  Really good. The proscuitto came with cracker sticks which balanced the saltiness of proscuitto.  The salami had a nice kick to it and there was some other cured meat served on bread that unfortunately my server didn't know what it was. It's okay though - just another excuse to go back and have it again (and hopefully the next server will know). 

Mains - my boyfriend really enjoyed his Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, which he thoroughly enjoyed with his glass of red wine. A simple dish with a hearty meat sauce. I had the Ravioli di Zio Paperone. It was stuffed with duck confit and buttercup squash, while I didn't taste the duck at all (unfortunate), I liked the squash so I didn't complain. 

Dessert - My boyfriend had the flourless chocolate lava cake was divine (yes, divine!). The warmed rich chocolate oozing out of the cake is just delicious.  If you have to settle for just one dessert, this is it (I had about a quarter of it ^_^) As for myself, I ordered the tiramisu, which was probably the best tiramisu I've had.  I also ordered the Latte Macchiato that I think if I just closed my eyes and able to block out the noise around me I could have been taken back to Spain (yes, I know Terroni, is an Italian restaurant, but the latte tasted just like the ones I had in Spain). Perhaps, I've embellishing the latte a bit but it was the best I've had since my recent trip to Spain.

We both agreed that it was the 2nd best meal we've had together (1st would be Aqua in San Fran) and it was only a total of $95 for the both of us."}
{"text":"The food was decent - calamari, carpaccio and olive appetizers were good. The Ravioli is worth recommending. Had to call out to another waitress ( ours went missing) to get Parmesan and black pepper :("}
{"text":"Decided to pop in with my girlfriend for a nice sit down lunch. Beautiful warm atmosphere but the second we walked in we had a server sigh because we were in his way. His displeased sigh was loud and obvious and rude considering we were just standing in line waiting for a table. Once we arrived to our table, it took about 5 minutes for our server (same guy) to stop just staring at us but come over. When we opted for tap water and not mineral, he left and never came back with it. 5 minutes later, we had him come up and ask if we wanted bread. We asked if it came with the meal and he almost rolled his eyes and said yes. Still no water, he leaves and returns two minutes later without a word, drops the bread off and leaves. 5 minutes later we have a new server walk by and confusingly asks if we'd like water. After that, our server came back, asked what we'd like, refused to take prosciutto off my girlfriends pizza and suggested she instead eat another pizza (that was completely different) it was confusing that they wasted prosciutto. Could have easily been saved for another customer. He never returned and we had to get other people to serve us. Extremely disappointed with the service. Both my girlfriend and I work in the restaurant industry and were majorly turned off from the crappy service. Step it up guys! The pizza was awesome, the ravioli was tasty but oily and warm, not hot. Glancing at other tables, their dishes were steaming hot. Would have preferred duck ravioli to be hot, not warm. Would I go back? Maybe to a different location."}
{"text":"Classic Italian food within a beautifully decorated restaurant. I came here for a family outing and everyone left satisfied. The pizza's are done extremely well and the seafood pasta is to die for. The only issue I had was with the service. Our server would often disappear for 20-30 minutes at a time. The food was also a little slow to get to our tables (although I can understand why since it seems like a lot of effort went into the preparation). Food is a 5/5. Very affordable and a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I agree with the \"Pizzas and the daily entree specials are consistently exceptional, while pasta dishes have repeatedly let me down.\" comment in a review below. The pastas seem very home-cooked, not what you would expect from a restaurant such as this.
The pizza, appetizer were good. And the dessert was excellent! (i tried the Tiramisu and this molten chocolate cake)
I'd definitely go back for coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"I've only been to the Adelaide street location which I have to say is very beautiful  The lamb ragu on pasta I had both times I went was delicious, I actually get cravings for it.  The service was good although a bit pretentious."}
{"text":"Quite the busy little place! Thanks to our willingness to sit in a booth by the door and the long queue to get a table, my wife and I were able to sit quickly. As all the reviews rave about the pizza I decided to go for a honey an pair affair which was sticky, but still good.

Service was friendly and managed to do a good job of keeping tabs on us even though we were in a hard-to-reach place thanks to the line.

Basically it is missing a star because while the food was good, it didn't cause me to just flip out."}
{"text":"Walked in on a weeknight with no reservation, and although it was busy, they were able to seat us within 10 minutes. My date's duck ravioli was good, and he really enjoyed it. My pasta was the special for the day, and it was good, but not the best I've ever had. Our appetizers were what made the meal great. A mushroom and arugala salad was delicious, as well as the fried squash blossoms. Pricey, but I would go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I wish I could go every day.
I have seen this place growing organically under my eye... from a hole in the wall of queen west, to an empire with locations in L.A.
you will never get tired of Terroni's menu. Also, an important thing about restaurants is that, their food menu has to be complimented by a likely amazing wine list, and these guys do. Best white wines from the northest regions of Italy, cans find that easily in Toronto.
I took my parents visiting from Rome, and my mom ended up kissing one of the owners... I think I don't need to add anything further about Terroni."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place is popular, the staff is rude, they have a lot of attitude and don't allow any substitutions ( that's not how they do it in Italy my friends).
We went there for dinner as s group of 4 and were extremely disappointed. Our experience was terrible from the time we got there ( the only reason we decided to eat at terronis was because Mercatto had a private event going on that night) and boy were we ever regretful.
Our servor decided that she couldn't handle a busy night and when we requested her to take our order, we were met with the following response \" I have to actually walk with my legs to the front to get you a menu\". Seriously, Is this level of rudeness what I am paying for? We had to place our order twice as she didn't write it down the first time and came back to go through the whole ordering exercise again.
Now for the food, we ordered 4 pastas and 3 pizzas and I have to say they were mediocre at best.
Save your money and time and go to mercatto or the other fabulous Italian spots in the city where you are greeted warmly and with no attitude and the food is better."}
{"text":"A bunch of my coworkers and I dined at Terroni last Friday night. We made a reservation ahead of time for our group of 12, and we were informed in advance that no one will be seated until at least half the group has arrived.

The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived at 5 o'clock. Odd, but I believe the servers switched shifts at this hour, so I felt the \"morning server\" did not bother to spend much time greeting us and introducing us to the restaurant. When I asked for some of her recommendations, she just pointed me to the special menu for the day and walked away... So we took our time deciding until our server came by and she spent some time explaining some of the dishes she recommended. 

Three of my coworkers and I shared the Santo Stefano Pizza (prosciutto and arugula pizza), Ravioli di Zio Paperone (ravioli stuffed with duck confit), and Spaghetti in Canna a Mare (seafood spaghetti). 

The pizza was not the best, but it was not bad. The ravioli was interesting, and I mean that in a good way. I normally have duck in the form of roast duck, Chiu Chow marinated duck, and seared duck breast, but never with pasta. I love mushrooms, but I find with certain types of fresh mushrooms, there is a particular smell and taste, and that was present in this pasta. It is definitely an acquired taste. The seafood spaghetti was my favourite out of the 3 dishes. There was quite a bit of seafood, and it was light and tasty. Unfortunately, I found both of the pastas were slightly overcooked, just past al dente. Knowing I was dining at a well-known Italian restaurant, I was not impressed.

For dessert, we ordered the Tiramisu and the Torta Calda al Cioccolato (warm flourless chocolate cake). I have definitely tasted better tiramisu elsewhere, but the flourless chocolate cake was pretty delicious! It came out nice and warm, and the cake was soft and chocolatey with dark chocolate oozing from the centre. Most importantly, it was not too sweet. I had a bit of my coworker's Creme Caramel as well, but I found that was way too sweet for me.

As for the service, I felt once we received our mains, the server made less and less of an appearance at our table. Besides that, it became quite noisy by the end of our dinner as it became a packed house. This made conversations a bit difficult, especially across the long table. 

All in all, my experience at this particular Terroni was all right. It was nothing special. The food and service was not spectacular. I would not choose to dine here again, but I would not mind it if my friends wanted to try it, as long as I can have the warm flourless chocolate cake again. ;)"}
{"text":"I went there recently with my family for my birthday as we have never had Italian food. The outside is very beautiful. The inside is absolutely massive and spacious even though it was extremely busy Friday night. It was a bit too dim for my liking. It honestly felt magical inside. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the food. The waitresses do not really have a great knowledge of the food so they couldn't explain beyond what we have already deduced from the title of the meal. Food took around 45 minutes to arrive. We ordered pizza and some pastas and they were all quite bad. The pizza was EXTREMELY salty, no it did not have anchovies or sardines... The chef must've dropped the salt shaker on the pizza while making it, how else could it be that damn salty? It wasn't cut either which was odd, no pizza cutters were provided so we had to cut it with a knife. The pasta was mushy and too sour. We didn't get any breadsticks. The staff was meh, not bad but not good either. Don't think they deserve the absurd tip they demand... In the end the entire meal was around $100 for two pastas and two pizzas. This place isn't good for someone just getting in to restaurants or Italian cuisine.

My brother went again with an Italian friend so this time there was no confusion with the menu. This time he had a good time. I think the chef on our day was just really bad as the other reviews are good."}
{"text":"We usually love this place, but the last time we were there, in a group of four, our food came out at all different times (a good 5 minutes between some of us getting our pastas and others getting pizza). When the pasta came out, it was only warm and not hot.

Disappointing visit. I'm not sure that we'll be back."}
{"text":"I love the building and interior design but the food and service is so average.  I hate that you can't have any variation at all on the food. My friend wasn't even allowed a side of dipping sauce for calamari.  I won't go back by choice."}
{"text":"I miss the Terroni from the Victoria Street era. Yes, the space is beautiful, but it's so busy all the time and I think the quality of the service is suffering. Much prefer the Queen Street location."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in town. I usually have the Li Pecuri, with goat cheese and arugula."}
{"text":"I ordered carpaccio de manzo the portion was small I had to go for dinner somewhere else after! It taste good though I have been to Italy many times the way they serve portions there definitely different, they have good wine but again the portion for the price was too much"}
{"text":"I understand \"no substitutions\" is implemented by some busy restaurants, but in this day in age - c'mon! At least be nice about it! Allergies are commonplace now. I have the right to know what's in a dish and if you can't substitute something (or easily not add something, like a topping), at least don't be rude about it!  Has this changed?"}
{"text":"The service is extremely slow. The servers also are not very helpful. The food was good, but not good enough to make up for the poor service and lousy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Let's start with the ambiance:

First, you enter the place. . .the acoustics are terrible and, on a busy night, you can't hear the person across from you without screaming. Every inch of the joint is used for seating and you get the impression that they are selling by volume. However, the upside of this atmosphere is that, in a way, it seems like the busier Italian trattorias you can go to in Rome or Palermo where people are packed in and you have to sit with all sorts of new friends whom you end up getting along with great. . .as long as the wine is good. Too bad here, the wine starts at $40 a bottle and there are no house options. . .so we split a few beers.

Adesso, il cibo:

Can't speak for the secondi piati, however, the verdure and the pizze were actually excellent. The pizza was much closer to pizze we'd all had on the street in Roma or Napoli esp. with the consistency of the sauce and the quality of the meats. In particular, the homemade sausage was very peppery but just right whearas the \"proshoot\" was also also top notch. The scamorza in particular was smoky and just right. Finally, the crust was light but just thick enough to make these pizze some of the better thin crust pizze we've had.

Finalemente, if you are particularly sensitive to art, you may find the somewhat grotesque puppets hanging on the wall rather unappetizing. Perhaps food doesn't go to well with Commedia dell'arte, mi dispiace Arlecchino."}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype surrounding this place.  Went here with a large party of 15 people that were all raving about how much they love this restaurant.  Therefore, I went in with high expectations that quickly were not met.

I was 15 minutes early, so I went to sit at the bar, where I found a few of my fellow partygoers chilling.  I ordered a $10 glass of wine from the bartender.  Everything was fine, but when it came to settle our bill at the bar, I was extremely confused by the fact that the bartender gave my friends and me one bill.  I understand that Terroni's policy is one bill, but come on, we each came in ALONE and sat down at the bar at SEPERATE times.  We are all obviously in our early 20s, which means we obviously are not gonna be paying for one another's drinks so why did the bartender seem to find it sensible to put us all on one bill?  But whatever, fine, I knew that Terroni was a silly place with all its rules so I brought cash and we settled the bill and moved up to our table.

Upon sitting down, we looked at the wine menu again to possibly order a bottle and noticed that the wine that we just purchased downstairs at the bar was $2 more expensive/glass than the glasses on the wine menu in the restaurant... wish we knew that before ordering at the bar... 

After these two blunders, I was a bit miffed about the whole establishment, but figured the food may be amazing, in which case who cares!  
Well... 
The bread for the table was so stale to the point that I thought I chipped a tooth biting into it (and it doesn't help they won't give you olive oil to dip it in). 
Beef carpaccio starter had WAY too much lemon on it, which took away from the beef flavor and made me feel like I was just eating beef textured lemon pieces (yes, it was weird).
My main, the Duck Ravioli, was ordered after a friend recommended it and after reading the positive yelp reviews on it.  However,  I was very disappointed.  The dish itself was bland due to the lack of salt from the parmesan or just salt in general.  The pasta was slightly undercooked, not al dente even, just undercooked.  The duck stuffing was decent, but did not have a standout flavor that harmonized the dish, almost seemed like it was added simply to sound unique and garner a higher price tag.

At the end of the dinner, I walked out with $60 less in my wallet and a resolve to find a better Italian restaurant in Toronto"}
{"text":"A great place to meet up with friends for dinner. Pasta and pizza are solid. They have a great rooftop patio you can where you can wait to be seated. Had the lemon spaghetti and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Terroni is a decent place to grab a bite to eat if you're in the Downtown area, but I probably won't go out of my way to eat there again. As good as the pizza is, you're still paying $14 or more for a medium sized pizza that probably isn't that much better than something you can make at home, with the same gourmet ingredients (baby spinach, goat cheese, etc.). But who has the time nowadays to cook a meal at home. 

Still, their pizza is probably the best you can get in the city, surpassed only perhaps by Magic Oven...

The service is exceptional, on both occasions I've been there. Very 
nice looking restaurant too, and the patio in the summer is especially nice. I love the traditional Italian eatery vibe, with the walls lined in preserves and take-home goodies. Great Place to come to!"}
{"text":"I had an alright dinner here. I dont understand why there is always a line though!

The prosciutto app was great, tho pricey . I ordered one of the pizzas, which was....good. not great. I honestly dont understand what the fuss is about the pizza at terroni's 

my date ordered a pasta dish which he seemed to enjoy.

The waitress was nice and service quite fast. 

I would try a new place next time though."}
{"text":"Terroni nevers fails to impress.  I had the Ricchia salad to start, superb.  Followed by the Natalina pizza, again very tasty; I would order both again.  They have an extensive wine list if you're willing to shell out the cash.  I opted for a couple of gins instead and am happy to report they were a \"mere\" 7$ each, not too bad.

I would definitely go back but if the decision is mine then I'd rather go back to the Adelaide location.  I happen to like the look and feel of that location better than the Queen West one."}
{"text":"Food is good, bottom line. The restaurant is a beauty with a bar on the first floor and dine-in restaurant on the 2nd floor and rooftop (great for summer!). Felt an adult only aura here, I wouldn't recommend against bringing small kids, but the crowd here can be very picky about their dining experience."}
{"text":"Love this spot. I come here a few times a month. My favourite dish is the Spaghetti Limone. It's simple, flavourful and delicious. The pizzas are awesome too. 
The service is good- the staff are young and charismatic- and the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.
If you come at dinner time, be prepared to wait at the bar. If you don't mind having a drink beforehand, then it's fun. If you like a lively atmosphere and southern Italian food, Terroni is the place to be any night of the week. 
This location is more spacious and open concept than the original location on Queen West."}
{"text":"I like to say I have food allergies. That way they have no choice but to accommodate my tastes despite their \"chefs\" thinking they're too good for changes. It's fun, and annoys the pretentious staff. Win-win. (Of course, I tip generously)."}
{"text":"Love Terroni.  Been going to Terroni for almost 20 years.  Love the atmosphere at the Price st. location.  Been to all 3 locations in Toronto and the one in WeHo, and prefer Price st. location the most.  As a matter of fact, going there again this coming weekend."}
{"text":"Amazing dishes and amazing desert, their flourless chocolate cake is literally heaven in your mouth, great place, would go again."}
{"text":"There is nothing like true Italian food- simple, unfettered dishes that allow the quality of the ingredients shine through- and Terroni is one place that I always love to visit when I am in Toronto- especially the location on Queen off Bathurst. So when a fellow visitor told me the had never been, it was a perfect excuse to visit once again.

We started with a melt-in-your-mouth beef carpaccio, which was accented with generous shavings of nutty Parmigiano Reggiano, a sprinkling of peppery baby arugula, and drizzled with just the lightest touch of fruity extra virgin olive oil. 

And that was only the beginning. I savoured the fresh clean taste of my pappardelle with lamb ragout, which was served purposely sans Parmigiano so as not to mask the flavours of the ingredients. Of course, though- having no self control, I HAD to sample my dinner companion's duck confit ravioli, which was equally deliciously simple. 

The real test? My favourite- ask the server to do a pairing with my dessert- a lemon custard tart. Instead of a standard coffee drink (which most go with because it is the easy way out, although still delicious), chose for me a delicious Amarro- which went perfect with my fluffy, yet creamy lemony treat, and what I would have chosen as a sommelier. 

Once again, I was reminded of why I really love this great Toronto staple. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I always have a great meal at Terroni. This was my first visit to the Queen West location, since I normally go to the Adelaide one. The Adelaide location is gorgeous, but this one is warmer and more intimate. 

We ended up sitting at the bar because the wait was extremely long, which is to be expected, but the service was good enough that this did not detract from the experience. 

We got a bottle of prosecco and some pasta and it was an awesome dinner. I don't even need to recommend anything to order because I end up getting something different each time, and it's always good."}
{"text":"Have been to the Terroni on Adelaide and have always had a good time. Visited the queen Terroni for the second time and was disappointed yet again. The food was okay, nothing to write home about, but the service was enough for me to write a review. The problem was our waitstaff- every question we had about the menu (do you guys have any chicken?) we were answered with \"NO THIS IS AUTHENTIC ITALIAN WE DON'T DO THAT\" and simply walking away. This continued to happen throughout our lunch there when we asked for something, and it got to be VERY ANNOYING. When we asked for balsamic vinegar to go with our bread- we got yet again \"NO, IF THEY DON'T DO IT IN ITALY, WE DO NOT DO IT HERE\". I felt like I had to read a book on traditional Italian food before heading to this place- all of our questions could have been answered without the snooty \"Its not authentic to do that\". Made us feel completely out of place and unwelcome. The next time, I would suggest wait staff take a more positive educational tone when informing customers about authentic Italian food- he honestly was insulted by our requests for anything. A simple no, we do not carry that, would suffice next time! Will never visit this location again, without taking a full course in Italian Culinary History. Would not recommend anyone trying it out there, the food needs to be bomb for me to take terrible snooty service!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I would give no star at all if I can. 

I went to Terroni this afternoon so I can take my sister and my nieces there as this was one of my favourite restaurant in Toronto. And I took them there early so it wouldn't be too busy. However, I say 'was' because I would never go back there again. 

So this is what happened - I asked the host for a table of 4 and even though the dining room was quite empty, she told the waitress to seat us by the door at the bar. I asked her if we can sit in the dining room and she said it was all reserved. Yet two groups of people after us without reservation were all seated in the main dining room. 

I tried to ask the waitress or hostess for why we can't be seated in the dining room and no one paid attention to us. We chose to leave and my sister and nieces were extremely upset. 

Is it because we are Asians or we were with kids? Is that why we were treated only with rudeness and contempt? Is Terroni racially discriminant or family unfriendly? 

I lived in many countries and have never been treated this way. This is just beyond me. I will share this horrible experience with all my friends and unfortunately no more Terroni for me. 

Also, we ended going to G for Gelato down the Adelaide Street and the waiter was so lovely. He brought my nieces candies for treats and had a lovely conversation with them about their Halloween. What a contrast. And their pizza and gelato are great."}
{"text":"I don't know how?
 I don't know why?
I don't care how!?
 I don't care why! 

For some reason, there is something about Terroni's that make me ridiculously satisfied. 
I'd say it's definitely my favourite Pasta joint in town for the price, and the food is spot on every time my wife and I visit. 

Every location is great, even when I had the opportunity to eat at the L.A location on Beverly, my trusty ol dish was the same in quality, smell, taste, and flavour. 

I don't care if its busy, i dont care if it's loud, i enjoy my food everytime we go.
Order any Prime, Insalate or Pizze And you wont be disapointed.  Let those hipsters bring on the pasta! 

We tend to ignore everyone around us once we enter the zone with the first bites of our coveted pasta lemone and we will pass the hour and a half eating slowly and sipping ourselves into a house white winelemony buzz........


Cheers to The establishment! 
a must visit for Toronto eaters! 

Amen."}
{"text":"I love Terroni! It's my favourite Italian restaurant in the city. Meals are consistently delicious and the staff is always on the ball!"}
{"text":"The main problem with Terroni is that it is unbearably pretentious. It's one of those places where you are not to disrespect the menu with your request not to have mushrooms on your pizza, despite the fact I have hated mushrooms my entire life. The servers also act like they are somehow indulging you by doing you the honour of the delivering food right to your table. It's like they went and took the first 10 people they found on Ossington, put them in a restaurant and asked them to serve a bunch of investment bankers. There is also some guy \"spinning\" (I put spinning in quotation marks because he uses a Mac and iTunes, although it is a very complicated looking set up) during lunch. But hey, I'm sure that the bankers from RBC really appreciate his latest Jay-Z/Journey mash-ups while they talk business. 

There are some good things about Terroni though. The food is pretty decent, even if moderately overpriced, and the location is pretty cool. If you are looking for Italian downtown over lunch Mercatto on Bay is a much better bet. However, there is no DJ at Mercatto and your server might not have cool plastic framed glasses with no lenses, but if you are able to get past those flaws the food is really good.."}
{"text":"Great food some issues with the service that was too much or not enough, our waiter was not consistent at all in his service. Had the ravioli with the oyster mushroom and butternut squash an exciting and yummy portion of stuffed spinach pasta. the arugula salad was at best lacklustre and disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm in Toronto for a few months from Australia and have to say that this place is wonderful. 

Always long lines so we generally pop up the road for a cocktail and return when things have quietened down. Pizza is great, wine is great, servers are lovely and helpful and dessert is always amazing. 

Leaving Toronto in November and have to say that this will be one of the places I'll miss most."}
{"text":"I have serious issues with any place that doesn't allow a reasonably sized table (in our case, 4 guests) to be seated until the entire party has arrived. My friend and I showed up on time for our reservation on the patio and were advised by the hostess that we would not be seated until our other two friends arrived. We were then invited to order drinks in the \"waiting area\" in the interim. To be clear, this waiting area was not even a proper bar space. It was simply a crowded area at the entrance of the patio filled with other frustrated and cranky and unseated guests. Sorry, but I'm not paying to enjoy my drink while being bumped and elbowed by other guests who also made the unforgivable mistake of showing up without their entire party. 
I'm only giving Terroni a second star because the food wasn't offensive (although not out of this world) and our server was pleasant enough. 
But at the end of the day, I firmly believe that a guest's overall experience is very much influenced by the type of welcome they receive. When guests arrive, welcome them with open arms, be grateful that they have chosen your business to dine at and be gracious. To echo other reviewers, Terroni, get over yourself."}
{"text":"First time here, the pizza is good and satisfying, the calamari was cooked perfectly but over salted.  The beef carpaccio was not beef tenderloin but thinly sliced beef that was tenderized.  The tiramisu was all dairy and not much coffee soaked cookies... 
Not a total fan of the atmosphere.  The tables are a little too close together and the three tables at the entrance is not a great spot to sit especially when there's a huge line up.  (We did not sit there, but I would not enjoy myself if I had to) 
I would return to try other menu items and staff is friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and sat both in the restaurant and on the back patio. Atmosphere is great and pricing is okay; trypical in that if you make expensive selections your meal could become very expensive. Still, I'm always willing to go back there.

My one complaint is that the washrooms - which are really nice - are hard to find even with direction. It's also fairly loud inside, but if you're Italian you're used to a noisy meal. The food does not disappoint at the very least."}
{"text":"Terroni is stupid. It's just plain crap yo. Don't believe the hype. This is the most scenester joint in Toronto. All the Toronto musicians and scene \"operators\" who talk down about scenesters are contstantly at this place eating dinner. This is also where hipster parents take their brat kids even though screaming kids and strollers are totally inappropriate in the cramped, adult joint.

There's only one thing I can eat on the menu, and that's the nicoise (they call it something else because they're so brutally Italian that they wouldn't dare admit that they have a French dish on their menu) and whenever I ask if they can modify or make me something without meat, they basically spit on the ground by my feet. And that's what the hipsters like. The shit service and treatment.

I don't like being treated like crap when I go out. And I like paying for what I want. And I also like leg room. I am not interested in words like \"no\". 

The only thing it's got going for it, is a good coffee. But shit, I can get that a a zillion spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good service and decent food, if slightly overpriced. Great intimate ambiance and decor though, take your date there and they will be impressed."}
{"text":"Food was good. Olive oil was kinda bitter. Pasta was delicious - well seasoned. 

Service was TERRIBLE. Not sure why the server hated us. He was rude and just mean. 

Not sure why I would go back here. There are nicer places to go in Toronto."}
{"text":"I don't understand why Terroni is so popular.  I've eaten at both locations several times and each time I experience mediocre food at high prices.  To make it worse, at the Queen St location the mediocre, overpriced food is served by unpleasant servers.  Main courses are not always served at the same time.  One evening, we had to wait almost 10 minutes between the time my husband and I were served and the time that our two friends were served.  And no explanation for the delay was offered.  If you absolutely must eat at Terroni, go to the downtown location - at least it is in an interesting building with a large bar area.  

Note that the restaurant does not do substitutions - \"out of respect for Italian gastronomy\"."}
{"text":"In the owner's drive for turnover, they have a ridiculous NO SUBSTITUTION policy that is written all over the menu.

But they do allow you to order like Jack Nicholson did in FIVE EASY PIECES: chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast, no mayonnaise, no butter, no lettuce and hold the chicken. All this so he could get toast."}
{"text":"Warm, comfortable, vibrant ambience ... Excellent customer service.  The menu is just wide-ranging and eclectic enough to be interesting, but not so vast as to be overwhelming.  The freshly made gnocchi is unbeatable, in my opinion.  The simple mixed green salad is awesome -- gorgeous in its presentation and delicious.  Definitely a place to which I'll return, again and again.  It's the kind of place you quickly come to think of as your own."}
{"text":"Service was good, even during a busy Friday night .  The food was tasty but nothing outstanding.  Standard Americanized Italian food. For a table of two we had; grilled calamari, tagliatelle a la bolognese, pear pizza with prosciutto and walnuts, and to finish a limoncello gelato."}
{"text":"The Uptown Terroni is a bit better because all the uptown WASPs would never stand for what the downtown hipsters do. They still don't modify much and there's a lot of scouring and claiming that bad service is merely Italian, but their takeout is a lot better, they DO have a bit of leg room and once you hit them up enough times, they'll at least take the pork off for ya.

I wouldn't say it's so good, it's worth the drive uptown, but it's certainly better than the one on Queen. And the best thing is, if you eat here on a date, you won't be gossiped about for weeks on end. Unless that's what you're aiming for, then go West my spot light seeking friend."}
{"text":"Terroni has amazing food with a great atmosphere. Classic Italian dishes made from scratch and high quality ingredients. Fresh pasta and pizza are fantastic. They do seafood very well also, fresh and delicious. You have to ask but there is a special Gluten free and vegan pasta menu available, both fresh pasta. Can hardly taste the difference!! The rooftop patio in the summer is beautiful. They are great for parties, (you can create a special menu) and have excellent service. The only thing is they don't allow substitutions as to not mess with the original Italian recipes, not ideal for people with allergies."}
{"text":"tasty food, haven't gone wrong with anything i've ordered as of yet

a bit loud as far as environment goes but it didn't bother me"}
{"text":"Terroni didn't always suck. When it first opened the thin crust pizzas were a revelation, the cozy vibe a delight. Then they expanded and franchised. Something was lost. It's noisy and crowded, overpriced, and as noted, the service is too snobby for a restaurant at this level. Time was when you asked for cheese in this joint a giant block of grana padano housed in it's own grater was proffered. But don't ask for that now, you get a face full of daggers.

You can still have fun and a good meal here if you come for lunch or mid-week (I'm talking Monday to Wednesday) and stick to pizza. I've given the pastas several chances and it's always bland and overcooked. Salads, as at so many other Toronto restaurants, are from that abominable prepacked mesclun mix with the rotted bits of radicchio in it. In summer the patio is nice. But there are too many caveats on this place now. What a shame."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night for the first time, here on business from Chicago. We had reservations at 6 and were able to be seated right away, but by 7 the place was packed and people were waiting to be seated. Lots of large groups, and I'm guessing that's why it took an hour to get our food. So if you don't mind a long wait, I'd recommend it. The menu had a lot of interesting choices and our pizzas and pasta were good. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Prices are up and the food portions are down.  I complained to the manager Adam about the quality and quantity of our food; we were disappointed.  He gave me attitude and didn't seem to care really about his job and to please customers.  Management customer service is poor seems they are hiring any jerk off the street these days.  This isn't the first time I encountered poor Management at this restaurant.  I took our employees to Terroni over the holidays and they messed up our reservation and we had to wait when I saw that there were tables open.  Again it was Adam (I don't forget that name) and got attitude again that it was my fault I didn't make the reservation correct.  Really you say that to a customer!!!  This manager needs to be fired I'm sure I'm not the only customer that has has poor customer service from this so called Manager,  Watching him is painful."}
{"text":"Mmmm, good!
My Dad is in town for a visit and I wanted to take him somewhere cool, but accessible, and I had also wanted to go to Terroni since I have moved here recently from Vancouver and had heard good things about it.
First thing: our party of three got there before 6pm. So early for dinner, but we were hungry. So happy we got there early in the end, since there was a huge line soon after. 
We had the grilled kalamari to start, Dad had the lamb gnocchi, my partner had the sausage pappardelle  (alla Ilosa) and I had the rigatoni with fresh mozzarella, for dessert I had the panna cotta and we all drank a wonderful bottle of Pinot Nero.
Food was delicious all around. I am half Italian and although this isn't what my Nonna would have cooked me, the flavours were on point and we all really enjoyed our meals. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the sausage so tasty - although it wasn't spicy at all. The pasta was delicious, cooked nicely al dente and you could tell it was fresh. The panna cotta was delicious and the coffee was also very good.
A great meal.
Ambiance was boisterous, but not too loud. The music they were playing was excellent, just like what I play at home and my partner was impressed ;) Service was great, friendly but not too chatty. Efficient, polite, there when we needed her, refilled our glasses when she came by even though she was busy. Cute girls also help :)
We will go again!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Terroni. There was much hype for it to live up to so I will break it down to atmosphere, service, food and dessert because [spoiler alert] it really is a league of its own.

Atmosphere: Lovely. In the old Courthouse, the space was elegant and surprisingly not as dark as some places that border pretentious. The place is a comfortable and classy dining space for friends to chat post-work or for any type of evening.

Service: Something to be desired. I've seen other Terronis where the restaurant is unbelievably packed and this one wasn't one of them. I mean it was full but not with people uncomfortably lining out the door. So there didn't seem to be an excuse for the subpar service. They weren't rude, just not as attentive as most place. What can I say? I'm a bit of a princess.

Food: Fantastic. I ordered the Gnocchi and the portion was perfect enough to pave the way for the...

Dessert: [Drama Queen Alert] Best dessert of I've ever had! And I know my desserts. Flourless dark chocolate lava cake. It is this dessert that earned this place a 4-star rating from me. Eating this dessert is an experience on its own from your first whiff of its rich aroma to the smooth dark chocolate inside. This dessert makes you want to enjoy it and not just taste it, savour it and not just eat it. make love and not just F*CK. It's decadence on a plate and I nearly wept when it was over."}
{"text":"I don't speak out much on BAD service in Toronto but Terroni on Adelaide was the WORST experience I think I've encountered to date. I will say that the food there is spectacular but in terms of its servers (shout out to MICHELLE W) - I don't think they of all people should have a pretentious attitude towards their customers. It's NOT acceptable to treat the people you're serving like they're lesser than you, EVER. It's disgusting.

p.s. FIX your payment process - it's archaic to not be able to get separate bills and to ask your customers to calculate separate tax and tip.

p.p.s The people that ate at my table were young and etnhic minorities.  I'm positive that the server judged us all beforehand and I'm sure if we were all in business suits and a little older we wouldn't have been treated like that."}
{"text":"Way too many rules. We went there with six people for lunch. 

1. Can I switch a veggie on this pizza  - \"We don't do substitutions\"
2. Pizza comes uncut - Can we please get it cut up - \"We don't cut our pizza's\"
3. Can I have low fat milk with my coffee \"We don't serve low fat milk\"

While it's a cool spot, the arrogance of the wait staff really turns you off. 

I'd take a pass on this place. Just irritating people to deal with and the food is not good enough to put up with the attitude...."}
{"text":"Last Saturday was my second time eating at Terroni and it will always be the place I go when I want great atmosphere, good food and yummy wine :) 

Make sure if you have reservations (and you will want them on a weekend) that you ask for upstairs seating - the downstairs was a bit musty with much less character. We were originally seated there but the hostesses were so kind and switched us right away when we asked.

They had a wine expert who came to talk to us about what sort of wine would be best for our tastes and the server was so sweet. We loved her! Wish I could remember her name (must have been the red).

The only thing I wish is that you could make modifications to the dishes, such as if the butternut squash ravioli could come without Duck Confit for vegetarian-ish people like myself. I had the veggie pizza and it was quite good. I can't say the food is to die for, but all-around this place gets my full four stars!"}
{"text":"Wednesday nights are not what they're used to be: they're better. Especially when they involve dinner at Terroni, a hefty Italian restaurant in a converted courthouse nestled in the heart of Toronto. A buzzy lunch spot, I explored  the place with a local and I was fortunate to see every angle of the space (even the wine cellar, which was an old jail cell decades past, and columns still stand) before my friend found us a seat at the bar. Some of my favorite dinners have been barside - Grammercy Tavern, Woodfire Grill, Anissa, to name a few - if only because the heart of a restaurant comes through the simplicity of the bar experience. on this particular evening, it was the two of us rounding out a corner seat. Behind us though, the space was expansive - good for large groups and intimate gatherings due to the varied dining rooms - and well lit, as any good restaurant should be.  

We started the evening off with the perfect cocktail: a negroni. Then followed that with a bottle of red from the extensive wine list. Food was light that evening. A gorgeous plate of creamy burrata, after which came a crispy mushroom salad - baked not fried so the flavors come through clean -  and the most simple of pizza's,  a Margherita. 

The salad has been a staple on the menu since the restaurant opened, and I can understand why. It's a surprising combination of flavors and textures, a welcome respite for those tired of the traditional cured meat platter - though I hear Terroni does great work in their own salumeria. But the finery is always best found in the details. A good burrata on the menu will often indicate the restaurant is worth trying, if only for that cheese.     

Just don't expect pretension. Terroni keeps it simple, so you can be slightly decadent, and well, revel in your cocktail."}
{"text":"I have been to this location on a few occasions over the past few years. I have always been disappointed despite the number of positive reviews this restaurant seems to get! 

No experience was quite as bad as last night's. We were seated quickly - great. We were not asked where we would like to be seated - patio or not? Our server was VERY slow and did not offer ground pepper or Parmesan. She \"checked in\" once near the end of the meal. When she did speak to us, she just didn't seem interested at all. 
The food is always disappointing. There are MANY other decent Italian restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is your safest bet for Italian cuisine in the city. If you have ever been to Italy (or in my case lived there for a while) and actually know how things are suppose to be than you will appreciate the quality of the food at this place. The pizzas are the best in the city (although I have finally found a cheaper less busy alternative that rivals it!), the pasta is great, not overcooked mush like some god forsaken places claiming to be Italian restaurants, the ingredients are great, the price point is fair the only problem with this place is the goddamn wait! You can't reserve and you are always waiting. Sometimes it's a short wait but other times it's just not worth it. 

If you are going through Terroni pizza withdrawal and don't want to wait (I suffer this withdrawal at least once a month) check out Via Mercanti in Kensington. Pizzas are just as good and cheaper."}
{"text":"Walked in Sunday eve and nabbed the only available table by the door.  The line-up beside our table didn't stop us from thoroughly enjoying a great dinner nor the waiter from squeezing in to refill our wine and check on us regularly.  Grilled calamari was delicious with a lightly charred flavor and fresh diced tomatoes. We both had pasta and both were fresh and tasty.  Extensive wine list with enough choices in the 45 -  60 range (the Valpolacella was excellent) and many more in the 70-100 range. Busy,  friendly,  great food and excellent service.  I'll happily return but might make a reservation next time to get a better table."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I've been here five times and each time I've left happy, the food is just really good. I do agree with the other reviewers that it can get crowded with a line. But it's no surprise to me why that is. It's is also priced well, not too expensive."}
{"text":"Food amazing. Service 1 star. It has been a while since I have had such bad service. The staff was obnoxious. Will go to Terroni on Queens street."}
{"text":"I have been to Terroni twice. Sunday late dinner and a Monday late lunch. Although the restaurant was extremely busy Sunday night service and food was exceptional, 5 stars! The late Monday lunch was a different story. The restaurant was empty. We sat on the patio, service was slow, our food was delivered by a kitchen staff member to the wrong table. The kitchen staff members were taking smoke breaks behind the patio in the alley way and the cigarette smoke was drifting back to us, is was disgusting.I ask for my lunch pizza to go, our waitress wrap the pizza slices together and put them in a bag. When I inquired why she did it that way, I was told that is how they do take out. Not true,  as the table behind as had theirs put into a pizza box. It is unfortunate since l live in the area and had high hopes of making this one of my neighborhood go to restaurants."}
{"text":"-Went for lunch during a staycation as i heard about it on BlogTO and was blown away by the quality of the pasta - best I've ever had
-Duck ravioli and squash and  Pasta with meat sauce were amazing.  
-Coffee was amazing
-Pizza was extremely good
-Gelato / Affogato was also extremely good, but not the best ever.
-The chef's appetizer special is expensive but well worth it, always blows me away
-Expect a 45-60 minute wait at Queen West location.  I went to the La Bettola location which is almost zero wait time but same food quality
-Trendy music, but might be a bit loud.
-Not technically pricey (~$20 for meal) but find we end up spending quite a bit"}
{"text":"Used to really like this place. Particularly when it was over on Victoria. It's still solid for pasta but the service is still the same. The wait staff puts themselves out as the cool bohemian crowd who know their Italian fare but it comes off more like they don't give a crap and just want you out to make their next tip. As for the food, it's touch and go. Had the staple Pasta a Limone. It was flavourful but drenched in oil. Again, all the signs are that they're trying to push you out as fast as they can. If you need a quick spot with decent food, it should serve your needs but don't go in with high expectations. +ives: quick service - ives: food can be hit and miss, rushed alternative: try baci in Leslieville"}
{"text":"To start, I was brought sliced brown bread that was slightly burnt... Not a good start. I ordered the lamb which had a medley of mushrooms underneath and long sliced potatoes, presentation wasn't bad. But the food on the other hand well, the lamb was well done so I sent it back. I received a new plate about ten minutes later and it was medium to medium well done, I was starving so I started in to nothing but disappointment. The lamb had fat strips that were 1/4-1/2 inch wide and were not cooked/rendered. The parts that were editable were like chewing on a tire :(. The mushrooms underneath were soaking in a oil slick and rubbery. The potatoes were cooked well but had no salt on them... Actually nothing had been salted, it was all bland. 

I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Italian 'cause it's usually too bland but this is the only place I would go. Funggi (mushroom) salad is to die for...as well as their pastas and pizzas..I love that they always make sure their pasta is al dente.  Their Chocolate soufle is the bomb...better than Morton's!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favourite go-to restaurants in Toronto. I have yet to try something on their menu that I don't like! I love the atmosphere, wine menu, knowledgable staff and I'm a sucker for their chilli peppers."}
{"text":"Had high hopes when we walked in, but the servings were small and definitely not in the $$ category.  Pizza was ok but nothing special, and the tiramisu was dry.  I wouldn't be back here in a hurry.  All show, little substance."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever...
Made a reservation for 9. Didnt get a seat until 9:15 and than they put us next to the kitchen/service area with the burrning smell of pizza and staff hovering around us. Their staff so close that they kept hitting my shoulder and didnt even apologize. 
The manager came and didn't do anything about it.
They simply don't care about you because they are busy enough. And than they gave us burnt food

At the end we asked for the manager and came and appologied for the food."}
{"text":"My favourite Italian restaurant.  Try the Papardella a la Iosa with a Moretti beer.  Prices are very reasonable.  Atmosphere is always good."}
{"text":"What a joke, only not a funny one

I went there a couple of nights ago and ordered the seafood spaghetti.  I had to ask for ground pepper (there weren't any salt/pepper shakers on the table) and when I asked for Parmesan cheese, I was flat out denied. Yep, denied.  The server tried to explain to me that in Italy, they don't eat seafood pasta with Parmesan cheese because the strength of the cheese over-powers the delicate taste of seafood. Ok I thought, but I like Parmesan cheese with seafood pastas and I don't think I'm alone on this. \"So no one in Italy eats any of their seafood dishes with Parmesan cheese, at all\" I asked. And he replied that they don't and that they'll serve people who ask for it, but they'll look at you funny. Um, ok, so what do I care, right?  So then I asked if I could have Parmesan cheese after I eat all the seafood in my bowl.  And he said no, that the restaurant's policy is not to serve Parmesan cheese with that dish.  Wow.  So I'm about to pay $17 for a lunch-sized bowl of pasta and not be able to eat it the way I want to.  I was able to get chilies in chili oil, yay.
I can understand if the restaurant didn't have Parmesan cheese in the actual place to serve to me.  But they have it, they just won't allow me to have it with the dish I ordered.  Will this type  of fascism extend to the type of wine I order?  
All in all, this is totally retarded and a crock of s*** because I know for a fact Italians enjoy eating seafood pastas with Parmesan.  I think Terroni's is just compensating for the sorry-looking morsels of seafood they put into their plates.
I've been there before and had the risotto.  Same thing, very small portion and mostly lacking in flavor.
The only thing that was worth remembering was their chocolate lava cake. 
They are over-priced, over-hyped and  way up on itself.  People like to go because it's situated in the city's 'hip & trendy' area and has a work-staff that look like they all came out of Urban Outfitters, but really, don't be fooled, that's not what makes a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful room in an old courthouse.  Sweeping ceilings, abundant sunlight even in winter and a roaring fireplace for those colder days.  Among Terroni's three locations in Toronto, this is the one that I could comfortably bring my two young kids too.

The downside with this location is the food is relatively subpar compared to its other locations.  The pizza was too toasted, the pizza sauce was bland and the pasta was not as tasty.  For the food, I would stick to Terroni's Queen West location.  For the room, you gotta check out this Adelaide location."}
{"text":"I really liked the pizza I had. Nice dough with a crispy crust, not gooey in the middle. The meats plate appetizer was very tasty with a couple types of prosciutto and salami. Good Za, what more can I say?"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my family a week ago.
The food was excellent. I don't remember what I ordered, but it was some kind of pasta with truffles, which was amazing.
The service was good. Our waitress Erica managed to get us a larger table at the last minute for an unexpected extra guest. Other than that, she was very polite and helpful.
The food came to the table amazingly fast, even though we didn't ask for it, which was good since we were pressed for time."}
{"text":"They try and rush you out the door as soon as your plate is empty. I get you have lineups, but it's not McDonald's guys. You pay to sit as much to eat, don't you?"}
{"text":"Definitely a place I would recommend for a night out! Great food and drinks. The restaurant is really busy so call in advance to rsvp. 

We ordered 1/2 bottle of red since we didn't want too much wine that evening. The service was great and the server always made sure we had everything we needed. The Calamari alla Griglia is a must try as recommended by my friend and server. We also had Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo (which is a mix of cured meats and cheese- best of both worlds), Carpaccio di Manzo and Focu Meu pizza, which were all delicious as well. 

It is a bit pricey but definitely has great atmosphere, service and food."}
{"text":"After a christmas dinner mishap, my family and I came here for lunch the following day. The ambience is lovely, the service is fantastic, and the food was divine. I have dined at this location before on week days, and some of the dishes aren't always quite 5 stars. However, this time around every single thing we ordered was a hit & and my faith in this location had been restored. Thank you for a truly fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"Tsk, tsk, Terr(ibl)oni. If I were your Nonna, I'd tie you up and beat you silly with a rolling pin. Your pappardelle ($16!) was a mass of doughey, pastey mangles that still tasted of flour. I had to pick out the scant add-ins of shrimp and artichoke, leaving the tortured pasta behind like humiliated Abu Ghraib prisoners.

Your pizza's good, I'll give you that. But if you have an entire page of primi, boasting handmade pasta, either learn to cook it properly or just buy it from someone who knows their buccatini from their strozzapreti.

The service is authentically Italian; brusque and indifferent. However, you don't tip in Italy whereas servers in this country depend on gratuities. So next time our waitress should offer our table of 4 a little more than a stank attitude and over-exposed chesticles.

I don't get the lineups. Is it a case of the Emperor's New Blows?"}
{"text":"Over it. What used to be one of my face restos has lost it's charm. Staff now pushes you through hoping to clear the ever persistent line. Prices have risen while the food quality has dropped. During my last visit, the pasta was overbooked and the wait staff were inattentive and unhelpful.  I'm moving on - suggestions anyone?"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and pasta!  Great place for a cozy dinner!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but this place is not worth the hype.

When they didn't have any of the wine I liked by the glass (Chianti), I asked the server what she thought might be good instead. The wine she recommended was more like a Rose (think chilled and VERY watery) and was not at all up my alley. I think she just picked it at random. I don't blame her for not knowing the whole list, but I would have preferred if she just told me she wasn't sure. 

After that hiccup, the next glass I ordered was much better (I think it is a Terroni exclusive? I would really recommend it!). However, the service never recovered. She was inattentive for the entire evening. 

Anyway - this is a good spot if you are looking for loud, trendy and overpriced. Not somewhere I would run back to though."}
{"text":"This has the vibe you are looking for when you think of Friday night dinner with friends. The place is usually busy so if you want a quieter area where you can have a one on one convo ask to go to the lower floor where the wine cellar is. The food is delicious a bit on the expensive side but not ridiculous. I 100% recommend the ravioli that has rhe duck confit ever since I ate that I cannot try anything else from there! Overall excellent restaurant plus I find it surprising but they play old school hip-hop on the weekends sometimes and they usually have a Dj there."}
{"text":"Never before have I left such a small tip. 

Yes, the food was quite good. It was an early dinner, so we just went with entrees, and we deemed it too early for wine. While I understand that we weren't the most exciting table ever from a server's perspective, I still have certain expectations. 

Said expectations are not unreasonable. They include the following: 
-When you ask if parmesan or ground pepper is wanted and the answer is affirmative, bring some.
-If you're going to check on the table, do it when more then a few bites have been taken. Additionally, the parmesan/ground pepper check does not count as checking on the table.
-If the urinals in the washroom are overflowing, maybe think of closing the washroom for a bit. Or just maybe warn people that they run the risk of their shoes being covered in urinal-water (yum).

Pretty crazy stuff, I know. Probably won't go back....at least not to this location."}
{"text":"I went to Terroni's at this location, after having a good experience awhile ago at the Queen street location.  The experience here was a definite disappointment.

I made a reservation ahead of time for 2.  When we arrived, we waited close to an hour to be seated.  There were people who walked in who were seated sooner than us.  When we checked in with the hostess to check in on the status, she kept reassuring us that it would be \"5 more minutes\" and that our table was being set up.  When we were finally seated, the table had not been cleared or set up.  

Our server was was kind and apologetic despite our poor experience at the front.  The pizza and pasta that we had was good, but nothing particularly memorable.  

The decor is nice and the energy is loud, but certainly feels a little over-rated at this location."}
{"text":"Waking in to Terroni, the atmosphere is beautiful. It is a stunning restaurant. But that's about all that they have going for them. Our waiter came to see my table, and I couldn't help but notice that he smelled like cigarettes. He also kept reaching over me to serve water, so I was greeted with this smell often. Very unpleasant. We all order food, and it comes out within 7 minutes. I appreciate fast, but this made it feel like it was heated in a microwave. I got gnocchi, and when I asked for parm, I was told that they would not serve it with this pasta. They also don't cut the pizza, which could be very problematic for children or people with special needs. On top of this, this is the first Italian restaurant I've ever been to that didn't offer a free basket of bread. And when the bread arrived, they only allowed dipping in olive oil. The food was very mediocre, nothing special, especially for the snooty attitudes that the restaurant gives. When the check came, they would not split the bill, which just made everything more complicated. It felt very rushed, as they had us out of there in half an hour, even though we said we were in no hurry to leave. Overall, I'd avoid Terroni."}
{"text":"After 30 minutes we had to ask what the oil on our table was for. Once we asked, they brought the bread.
They refused to give us balsamic vinegar, they said it was because the owner of the restaurant owns an olive orchard and doesn't want his oil mixed with it because the oil was the so good. The manager of the restaurant admitted this was ridiculous but there was nothing he could do about it. Oh, and the oil tasted like any other olive oil we've had. Nothing special.
They refused to give us butter for our bread.
They refused to give us cream for our coffee, only milk.
They refused to give us parmesan cheese for our pasta.
They made us sign a waiver AT THE TABLE, IN FRONT OF OUR GUESTS, that we we would pay the $4.00/slice fee for bringing our own cake. We had brought the cake in earlier in the day. They couldn't ask us to sign the waiver at that time?
Never, ever, ever will I step into Terroni. We were so embarrassed in front of our guests."}
{"text":"I went there a few times. Love this restaurant. The food is really good. However, because this place is always busy, it is quite noisy there so  sometimes it is very hard to talk."}
{"text":"This place is really just ok. Any of the sausage-based pizzas are pretty good but the meats and cheeses are lacking in quality and have gone down-hill consistently over the last few years. If you like parmesan cheese on your pizza then you are out of luck as the staff will refuse to sprinkle any on your pizza; pasta, no problem, pizza - they will refuse. They lose a whole star based on the douchie pretentiousness of the staff thinking they know how their pizza should be served. It's odd because I've had pizza with parmesan cheese in Rome and Florence, places they try to emulate."}
{"text":"Nightmare experience. Waiters refuse to let you order diet coke, butter for your bread, tomato sauce to dip appetizer ... anything except the way its dictator manager decrees. Even if you offer to pay. Staff gets nasty if you ask for anything your way. Do yourself a favor -- avoid this unfriendly place. We walked out."}
{"text":"Had a fam lunch here today. Gotta say i was impressed with my meal tonnarelli alla norcina. Now i dont know wtf that is. But in laymens terms it was perfectly
Al dente spaghetti wit truffle shaved cheese and sauced ground meat. Now
Being from new york ive had fantastic pasta so ill show my big ego  and say my meal was tasty and legt. Now my girlfriends fam got pizza which doesnt hold a candle to grimaldis or julianas or john on bleeker steet. But non the less the great decor, very friendly waitresses. We were on the rooftop. Definitely a place you can stop by and grab a solid meal. Excellent calamari, steak tartare also as apps. Good restaurant"}
{"text":"I was under the impression that this location like the one on Queen West was traditional and classic in terms of atmosphere, ambience, food and service. 

The food was commendable we had the special bruschetta with spicy strawberry jam/ricotta, an antipasto bruschetta and one with eggplant? and the special porchetta pizza topped with arugula. 

The only disappointment was the noise level. We were seated in the main dining room right after the entrance/bar. I thought we just caught the tail end of the  post-lunch? work crowd (we dined around 130pm) but the rock music from the DJ located at the bar made diners speak excessively loud, we could here the diners beside us yelling at each other, we basically felt like we were at a pub on a Friday night. Not the type of restaurant to go to on a weekday lunch if you want to enjoy good Italian and be able to have decent conversation with the person in front of you. It may be more quiet on a weekend dinner, not sure. But other than that food, and service a plus."}
{"text":"Great food. The butternut squash ravioli was simply amazing and the place serves good pizzas as well. The affogato is to die for :) And lastly, lovely ambience!"}
{"text":"The first thing that caught my eye about this restaurant was the decor! The restaurant has high ceilings with plenty of natural light - it would be a great place to hold an event or an intimate wedding. There is also a choice of patio seating with umbrellas. We decided to sit outdoors to enjoy the beautiful weather. 

We ordered the Funghi Assoluti (which came highly recommended in the Yelp reviews), Margherita pizza, C't Mang pizza and the flourless chocolate cake. 

I enjoyed the Funghi Assoluti;however the portion was way too small for something that costs $15! The pizzas were fairly price at approximately $15-$19. The pizzas are very big and I would suggest to get a few to share so you can try different types. The Margherita pizza is what I would typically expect - it was good but not anything special. The c't Mang pizza was very interesting- it was a 'sweet' pizza. The pear and the walnuts made it seem more like a dessert than a main. Finally,  we got the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. The portion is quite small but the taste is heavy so it was filling despite its size. 

The service, food and decor were all great. I subtracted a star because of the WASHROOMS. For a restaurant that charges $15 for pasta, how come you can't refill the toilet paper in your washrooms? None of the stalls in the washroom had toilet paper. It seemed as if no one went to clean up or check on the stalls. Considering I went for lunch at 12, I'm surprised that the washrooms were already in that state."}
{"text":"It was our first time here.The food was good but the service was horrible. They dont let you sit at the table before all your friends get there. The waitress did not help us to understand the menu and no separate bills for a large group of people!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! Recommend Bufalina pizza! Not a huge fan of pizzas but those that are love this place. $$"}
{"text":"I eat at Terroni's frequently, probably once a week. The food is good, as authentic Italian as it can probably be in TO, thousands of miles away. 

No complaints whatsoever. We can even bring the kids, if it's early enough. Later in the evening it gets a bit crazy because the place is so popular. 

When I find time, I'll write more. 

There is usually a line. I've never actually considered waiting so no idea how long it would take."}
{"text":"Went to terroni for dinner. We were walk-ins and fully expected to wait. Our threshold was 30 minutes, so if the hostess told us longer , we would have gone elsewhere . She told us 30 minutes. An hour later we were still waiting. To add insult to injury , she took our cell number and promised to text as soon as a table opened up. We kept inquiring, and she kept saying another 10 minutes . It's now an hour and a half , still no text! Really , just tell people up front you can't accommodate them! 
Needless to say, we are very upset. You lost a table of 6 , plus another 6 people that I redirected outside who were told it would be about a 40 minute wait for a table. 
Bad service that started at the door!"}
{"text":"A friend raved about this place so he took me there this past Monday, Dec 19.  I was very disappointed with the lack of service.  We waited 15 mins at our table before someone approached us to ask if we wanted any water.  We had our menus closed and were ready to order!  After we ordered, a few minutes past and another server approached us asking to take our order. Then more than three servers served us before we were left with the one permanent server. The rolling numbers of servers didn't help speed up the food or make the dinner feel good. There was also a long waiting gap between our appetizers and the entrees.  The food portion was not the same as served at the other terronis, noted an experienced diner. For me, the food was just okay but nothing to rave about.  I would definitely try another restaurant before going back to this one.  Too bad, considering all the raves about terronis."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Terroni's on Queen St. so we decided to head uptown to this location at Yonge & Price.  We got there at 5:30pm on a weekday and the restaurant was virtually empty. We were greeted by a rude hostess asking if we can finish eating in 1 hour to make room for the 6:30pm rush. Seriously?
Our food was awesome as always and service wasn't bad. The bathrooms upstairs are really beautiful and modern, but it's really unpleasant to begin your dinner experience with a rude greeting.
We surpassed our \"1 hour dinner allowance\" and the restaurant still had tons of empty seats.
Sorry for the 3-star rating, I've absolutely Loved Terroni's every other time, but perhaps your hostesses should be a little more welcoming at Yonge & Price."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had in Toronto! Finished our meal off with the dark chocolate flourless cake which was also the best flourless chocolate cake I have ever had. Service was impeccable. If I lived downtown Toronto, I'd eat here all the time."}
{"text":"One of my go to Italian restaurants in the city. Food is always really nice, and the deserts are especially good. Some nights i wish i could skip appetizers and mains just to get them instead! My personal favourite is the carpaccio. It's super simple, full of flavour, and like everything else, reasonably priced.

Service is usually good, but depending on who you get. The last time i came, our server seemed like he was just going through the motions. I mean sure he did everything he was supposed to, but it was nothing special. Other nights however, the servers have been terrific. On that night with the so-so server, i actually remember spotting the waitress who served me the first time i came and thinking \"i really wish i had her instead right now!\" Another complaint i have is that while minor, the hosts seem especially rude. Not a good first impression. 

My only concern is that it seems a bit rushed. Don't get me wrong, the vibe and atmosphere are nothing to complain about. Always lots of families and large parties talking and having a good time. The problem is that the place is always so busy, i feel as if they try to get you in and out as quickly as possible. 

Overall, it's a nice place to go to. Good food, pretty good service, and a good choice to go out with family."}
{"text":"Okay. I have never in my life had a worse experience. I'm not even kidding though. The service was below average and we had a waitress who was very condescending. This place does not make a single accommodation. My poor brother who hates zucchini asked the waitress to simply get the pasts without zucchini - BUT NO... its too hard for the poor chefs. As if they enjoy wasting food. It's less work for them to NOT add it and saves them ingredients but nahhhh. Thats number one. Number 2. My uncle who is a diabetic asked for a diet coke - they don't serve any diet drinks there...NORMAL. Thirdly, my aunt and dad both got a seafood dish and asked for parmesan cheese - they were not allowed cheese on their seafood dish. again. NORMAL. If I do recall, customers are always right and should always be catered to. It was a horrible experience. Not to mention, the manager is pretty stupid as she didn't offer to give us free coffee, free dessert, nothing. Oh and how can I forget, they refused to serve us my birthday cake my mom brought in. Which is fine. But I mean, for all the trouble - I think that's the least they can do. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT. IT WAS A SHITTY EXPERIENCE AND I WILL MAKE SURE TO MAKE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY NEVER STEP FOOD IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN."}
{"text":"This was our second time coming to this Terroni location. Everything was great exactly how we remembered it, only even better this time.

We expected the Friday before Christmas to be ram-packed, but when we showed up for a table for two at 7:30pm we were seated immediately.

For the two of us we enjoyed a bottle of rosso, the funghi assoluti, and two pastas. For dessert we shared an affogato. We spent the next two hours taking our time and having a great conversation without ever feeling pressured to make space for other patrons.

We're looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"We came here based on some decent reviews about their Pizza, little did we know when we arrived, we wouldn't even be able to try it.  Here's how horrible this restaurant is:

1)  Called in the morning for reservations, was told they were completely full but to try their walk in service

2)  Arrived and was greeted by a snobby consierge that had to call upstairs to see if there was room for two  (tons of room throughout the entire restaurant by the way)

3)  Sat down and read thorugh the menue, most of which looked decent.  Ordered wine and apps.  Wine was decent, Calamari and Verti salad were all mediocore, and tasted blan.

4)  Went to order Pizza and was told they had a policy against creating or modifying any pizza's on their menue.  As my pallet didn't see anything in particular on the menue, and my fiance is vegan, we requested they speak to the manager about custom making or modifying toppings on the pizza's.  The manager did not even have the courtesy to come and see us themselves, however quickly sent the waitress over rejecting our requests.  

5)  Requested our bill and left, without a single appology or visit from any manager or chef.

All in all, I would rate this restaurant a zero.  With the vast choices for italian and pizza throughout Toronto, spend you money somewhere that will appreciate their customers and modify to dietery preferances.  Terroni has horrible customer service, sub par food and some of the worst management I've experienced.  How they stay in business in beyond me.

Case and point...  go somewhere else, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I work around the corner from this place and I enjoy my lunch each and every time I go there.  I've never made a reservation but always have been squeezed in.  They have amazing salads for lunch, and very fair portions.  Nice wine selection and always friendly service.  I'm still trying to go there for dinner one day."}
{"text":"Went here in June for my bf's birthday. He suggested it because he had gone to the one on Adelaide and I wanted to bring him somewhere that was a nice spot to celebrate. I made a reso and asked for the patio because we specifically chose the Queen location for their patio space. We were seated immediately and the patio was just as I thought it would be! After that though it basically went downhill. 
I don't consider myself an Italian food snob, but I have been lucky enough to go to some amazing Italian places in France, England, US and here in Canada. Haven't been to Italy yet haha. Anyway, when our server brought out the bread and olive oil I nearly choked becase the olive oil had a spice to it that I wasn't prepared for and was very sensitive to. (Spices aren't my thing) I asked her what was up and she said it was the owner's recipe. Alright, no biggie, but maybe just a caution about the spice? I could be overreacting. 
I ordered the beef carpaccio which I love and will always order from a menu. It was quite good and my bf liked it as well. Then I thought I'd go safe with a Bolognese which I've tasted some spectacular ones! This one? Such a disappointment. It came out with only noodles and meat. No sauce at all! I couldn't finish half of it because it was pretty gross. I told the server that I was disappointed and where is any sauce and she then got really snobby with me. Sorry, did you make the dish? Are you the owner? Please stop with the sass and pretentious attitude. She said she had to speak to the manager about my meal, because I didn't want to have to pay for something I barely touched and didn't like and she came back with \"we can give you free coffee and dessert.\" At that point I felt this attitude coming from her like I was trying to get a free meal, (which I wasn't, when I go out I plan on paying my fair share) and wouldn't order a dessert because I actually felt badly for speaking up. And the teeth clenching part is that soon after my visit to Terroni, I went to freaking Kelsey's with my parents and got our appetizers taken off the menu and a sincere apology from the server & manager for putting BBQ sauce on my chicken fajita dish because I didn't like the taste of it and asked for a new batch! Who would have expected Kelsey's attitude to be better than a \"go to\" place like Terroni? 
I'd go back for the carpaccio and actually will be next week...at least the next time I won't be paying so it might not be as bad."}
{"text":"Came here as a large group of 9. Ordered the mushroom salad, calamari, cheese platter, arancini balls, and two pizzas (Santo Stefano and Margherita) to start - all were super delicious, especially the mushroom salad and cheese platter. The most stand-out part of the night was our server Duncan. One of the entrees came out later than the rest (Just a mix-up in the kitchen. It happens.) and we were comped the entree, and two dessert platters! Apparently Duncan had also noticed we were there celebrating a birthday and came out with candles. And, of course, all the food was delicious and well-prepared. Will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple locations in Toronto and this is my favourite. Great environment, also if you just sit at the bar. Their pizza is just delicious, especially Al Salmone. You need to try some of their deserts as well, absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and fantastic deserts. Good restaurant choice for a date."}
{"text":"Absolutley LOVE this place.  Crazy good food, fun servers, awesome atmosphere and where else can you go for a Friday business lunch and hear a DJ spin?  What a great way to end a week!!!!   I will be back again and again.  And BTW,  I never have desert (especially at lunch), but the flourless choc cake...OMG!"}
{"text":"Great pasta place. Very noisy though. 

We did not have a reservation but the wait was less than 10 min. On a Friday night that is. The place was full with families, tourist and after work people but the ambience is great. Our waitress was slow even though she did not look be be very busy.  All and all the food was very good, the chocolate desert delicious. I will go back any day."}
{"text":"I was there with a group of 15 people on July 9th for dinner.  We had a reservation, but there was a mix-up when we arrived, so our party was split between 2 tables in different rooms.  Even though there was an empty table beside one of the tables we had, they refused to seat us together.  I couldn't get over the haughty attitude of the management.  The food was okay, not great; some of the pasta dishes were a little too al dente, and when we asked for butter for the bread or Worcestershire sauce for the meal, we were told we couldn't have it.  Ridiculous.  I was actually told by my waiter that they didn't have butter in the restaurant.  I find it hard to believe that an Italian restaurant can prepare their dishes without butter. 
This is NOT a five-star restaurant, although they seem to think they are.  There are hundreds of restaurants in downtown Toronto, and I will definitely not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"Loved the place, amazing food, not too expensive, service crew was especially wonderful, we're going back for sure."}
{"text":"Terroni on Queen West, is one of my three favourite restaurants in Toronto. I love love love it. I'm the type that typically only likes one or two items on a menu (even at my favourite places) but I've been thrilled with everything I've ever ordered at Terroni. I love the cozy, intimate and energetic ambience. Service has always been great from my experience. LOVE"}
{"text":"Good spot w a good vibe on the back patio.

Had a cple pizzas, lasagna, and a dessert tray with coworkers.  Good drink menu.

Service was very good"}
{"text":"I hold conflicting beliefs about terroni. Some of these are:

The servers know their stuff and can engage in meaningful conversation about the food and wine menus, which really makes the experience for me. But the service is pretty terrible, full of cooler than cool attitude and not nearly full enough of attention.

The food is amazing and authentic (the salads are big enough to share as an app and delicious, the cheese, meat, and olive boards are a must for me, and the thin crust, perfectly sauced pizzas are always tasty) but the food is also terrible (both pastas I've sampled have disappointed with mushy texture, bland sauce and/or seasoning and paltry servings of meat or veg).

It's also a bit overpriced, which would probably feel fine to me if a) the service was better b) I avoided the pastas and c) I had a good table. But the service isn't better, so although I enjoy my visits, I always leave feeling a little bit foolish for spending the money.

But visit I do. And will again. Probably with a couple of girlfriends who are happy to share the salad, meat board, and pizza with me while drinking whichever wine our server recommends and talking at such a pace that we don't really care that our server ignores us after taking our order."}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable Meal and busy every day of the week. The pasta is consistently reliable and the tiramisu is my favourite. I think I have tried most pasta dishes in the menu and all are very good. Will not disappoint. Make sure to make a reservation a few days in advance."}
{"text":"Good food & wine. They have great cheese plates & cappuccino. However, service could be much better & Mercato is very similar & has much better value."}
{"text":"we experienced similarly poor customer service to other patrons who have reviewed. i ordered the gnocchi. it was 17$ and i finished it by eating slowly and talking with friends in under 10 minutes. the serving size was pitifully small, and it really wasn't that great.

going again? no thanks."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. But they are so pretentious here. I asked for balsamic vinegar on my caprese salad and they said absolutely not. They claimed that their balsamic was \"kitchen grade\". Wtf does that even mean?

They also don't allow cheese on certain dishes."}
{"text":"I love Terroni, I know they don't do substitutions but it is alright with me, everything on their menu seems pretty good the way it is.

I usually take a pizza margherita with buffalo mozzarella has it tastes fantastic!

For lunch once I've tried their pasta and I have to say it was really good.

The only thing that is a little off about this place is that y don't do deliveries as I would love to order from them practically almost every day if I could.

Their wine list its also very good and they have a good selection of most best wine from all over Italy.

Some dishes are a little pricey but the place is well worth it and I'm sure they have a lot of expenses to take in consideration (the place is huge)!

I love to go to the bathroom here (lol) it is downstairs and it's very well done it seems to be in a old monastery in Europe and I always have this fear some illuminati kinda of presence is going to pop out any seconds so I always rush my visits to their lady's room, but I consider it also part of the exciting experience.

Don't go with expectations here and you'll be amazed of the quality of food they serve, hope this helps make you decide on your next visit."}
{"text":"Wow ,we walked out of this place so angry,they absolutely don't care about customer ,our waiter was so rude,when my son said he doesn't like mushrooms he said that it is time for him to learn to like them  ,also was not willing to work with us ordering things saying \"this is the way we want to present our food and it is not for everyone \"we'll I guess not,maybe they did not hear that customer should always be right.Not cool to treat paying customers like that,plenty of other really good Italian places  will be getting my business"}
{"text":"Came here expecting a good experience and dinner, instead was left with essentially a ruined experience because of an extra dose of pretentiousness. After getting calamari with cartilage still intact which I had to return, I opted for the fried calamari - which comes with only lemon as i was reminded by the manager aggressively 5 times. The issue comes in at this point where after asking for a simple marinara sauce for the bland calamari I was bluntly told we have it but won't give it to you repeatedly.

Is the idea of this place to make the customer feel stupid and inadequate for asking for a substitution or actually just satisfying a customer. Just seems to me a pretentious inability to accept that some of the foods just might be a bit plain and need a side.

In the end all it did was lose a customer over a simple principle of the customer is never right which is how they play here. Shocking"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was stupendous. There we're two of us sharing the tuna tartar and the Biratta tomato crostini - excellent starters to share. And we each had one of their signature pasta dishes. Presentation was excellent. 
However, service was slow, inattentive and self important. We weren't offered menus upon being seated. We had 4 different servers through the course of our 1.5 hour meal and the inconsistency resulted in poor service all around. In addition the front hall curtain and door were left open for the cool fall air to slip in. It's tough to says such things when the food was so good; but it's worth noting if you plan on going."}
{"text":"We visited Terroni Restaurant on Yonge for lunch on Victoria Day and we'd been thinking about visiting one of the chain for some time and so were looking forward to it. We were sat in the terrace and shortly after my wife asked if they had lemonade. After some wait we were disappointed to be brought two cans of lemonade instead of fresh as we exoected. The menu seemed a little limited but I ordered the steak and egg and my wife ordered the lasagna. We waited for what seemed.like ages for the food to arrive (the place didn't seem particularly busy) and I visited the washrooms in the meantime. There was a sickly smell in the men's washroom that I couldn't identify. I returned to the table and after even more waiting the food arrived. My steak lunch looked like a child's portion and my wife's lasagna was completely lacking in seasoning of any kind.
It did become tasty after our addition of salt! We paid and left and afterwards discovered that there is apparently another part to the restaurant that had a separate menu but no one had bothered to let us know of this when we came in. They also didn't ask us how any of the food was.
The waiters were friendly and helpful, its just everything took a long time. Drinks, food and bill all took time to arrive considering the restaurant wasn't busy. My wife's food was extremely bland and I left still hungry. Will think twice about returning."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Went here multiple times the week that we were there. Chef was very interactive with his customers! Definitely will go back when in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I should start off by saying that we are avid Terroni-goers - we go about once to twice a month, but to the Price St. location.

We were here with a group of 8 people for a birthday. It started off fine but the service just went down as the night went on. 

We waited for about an hour before we even had bread on the table. We then found out a popular dish was sold out (a dish that half the table was hoping for). When we finally started getting our meals, they were all brought out at different times, so some of us had our food go cold as we waited for our friends' plates to arrive. 

They have definitely changed their dishes - their bolognese used to be a hit. They changed their noodles to what taste like store-bought (not homemade) and the sauce was a big pile of meat sauce, which also changed. It used to be very meaty, less saucy. The sauce drowned the pasta.

A friend ordered the caprese salad and got what looked like three unripe tomatoes slides (still white in the middle) with what was barely mozzarella. 

As the evening went on, our serve became less apparent and her patience ran low. I should say we were by no means a demanding group - very easy going, no complaints throughout the evening. Not to mention that right beside us, all of the servers began eating family style at a table, which is extremely distracting and awkward to see. The last time we were  at the Adelaide location for another birthday, we saw them eating leftover cake from another party.

It's very disappointing to see the decline of taste and service, especially at a restaurant that we typically love. We had friends come as far as Brampton and Georgetown who were looking forward to the evening, and we all left disappointed with the overall experience."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio and we had a good time and good appetizers until our mains came and one of them included the carni pasta that they \"dont allow any cheese on\" but we still asked for cheese and they didnt let us then we asked for salt and they also didnt let us have any salt and gave us an attitude about asking for salt with phrases like \"i wasnt born yesterday\" and he just walked away. We asked another waiter for cheese and they refused they made it seem illegal and like a taboo topic in this restaurant to have cheese with the pasta and continued being rude and snobbish. We even asked to have the cheese on the side and I guess thats also forbidden. They had zero regards to our preferences and just cared about their own preferences as if they are eating the dish! Im still in shock that I am writing a review about a restaurant that banned me from adding cheese to my pasta! I guess the idea of the customer is always right is an issue here. They disregarded my preferences and what I want to eat, maybe next time they might as well eat my food."}
{"text":"Visiting here from Los Angeles, CA and this was recommended by our hotel.  It was a great little spot.  Great ambiance--and definitely sit on the patio if you can, it's a very cool vibe.  The food was delicious.  We especially enjoyed the oyster mushroom appetizer.  Different and delicious!  One odd thing is that they don't really serve balsamic vinegar (like with the bread they serve, etc.) We asked for some, and they brought us a white wine vinegar.  The waiter mentioned something about the balsamic \"staining the food.\" Huh?  No matter, balsamic or not, the food was delicious.  A must try if you are in Toronto. Oh, and they don't take reservations, but if you call ahead of time, they can give you a heads up on what the wait is like."}
{"text":"Maybe bi-monthly I'm here on a Fancy Dinner Night and I've had mixed experiences. 

Don't bother on Friday night if you have anything resembling an anxiety disorder. Walking in the front door was nearly enough to trigger a panic attack as we waded through the bar area and got a glimpse of the teeming mass beyond the hostess. Pass. During the week is generally much more reasonable, with only one shoulder-rubbing experience at a shared table so far. Otherwise a selection of the patio or almost any table you like.

The servers can be amazing. More than willing to discuss any item on the menu and really knowledgeable about the available wines (overheard another table providing an obscure description of what wine they felt like, the server picked one out immediately followed by exclamations of pleasure from that table over the wine later on. Awesome.) Willing to provide suggestions on how to get around the lack of tonic to go with my gin (wow!! limonata and gin!!) and available without being intrusive.

The servers can be terrible. Condescening and correcting of your imperfect accent (such a pet peeve for me!) while completely failing to show any knowledge about the food beyond their impeccable pronunciation of it. Absent and superior.

But the food is always lovely. The beef carpaccio served with parmesan and arugula is a balanced and appetizing appetizer (hehe!). The pizza has never failed to be fabulous with crispy thin crust and amazing ingredients (enormous strips of speck!!) that I've never really been interested in substituting. The gnocchi (my yard-stick for Italian restaurants nowadays) is soft and always well sauced (amazing lemon sauce on the special last time that blew my socks off, especially once they brought me the optional chilis to go with it.)

I will always wonder when I head to Terroni if I will have a pleasant time, or even stay at all. But the food and the times that have shone will keep me trying."}
{"text":"My friend and I  decided to visit Terroni's for dinner on Saturday night at 8.  We were coming in from the east end.  When we got there,  it didn't appear busy so we asked for a table for 2 and the hostess said it would be a 30 to 35 minute wait.  Of course 35 mins have gone by and still no seats and we even saw people there that had not been seated who got there before  us.  We took our business elsewhere to a local Japanese place.   If I'm being asked to wait 35 minutes we should be seated or truthfully tell us it's really an hour wait.  I'm  never going back there again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this Toronto Institution ever since I first moved here and finally got my chance last night. My first biggest dilemna was the location, it was either Queen St. (the original) or Adelaide and ultimately I chose Adelaide given feedback about the building at this location. My choice was definately on the ball in this old courthouse that converted into a very spacious restaurant with a strong metropolitan vibe.

The service was standard and very down to earth. The food was amazing, my S/O both tried a pasta, the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare (seafood) and the Papperdelle al Sugo di Cinghiale (wild boar). The pasta is made fresh daily and cooked to perfection. Both dishes were spectacular and I would definitely recommend. We also tried their desserts, Tiramisu and the Panna Cotta. Both equally good I can't say it was the best I've ever had of either. Overall it was a relaxing dinner experience and the prices don't break the bank. I would be back for the pastas and maybe next time try their pizzas where I hear is the rave.

PS. They don't servce balsamic vineger as the waiter explained to me the olive oil is specially made and adding any vineger would ruin the taste. I can honestly say the olive oil is different but i'm for one who still enjoys good balsamic with my olive oil."}
{"text":"Really fantastic atmosphere. We sat on the rooftop patio and loved the vibe of the place on a weekend night. The food was excellent, as it always is. 

What I loved most was the compartmentalized look this location has. There's something for everyone.  Quiet date,  chic bar, outdoor roofto patio, and casual family dinner. Incredible use of a wonderful space.

The only negatives were that they gave away/some one \"stole\" our table (so we had to wait for about 10 mins for a new one), and the waitress forgot about us a couple of times. In fact, I saw another waitress signal over to her to check up on our table because I suppose she noticed that we hadn't been visited in a bit. Luckily for our waitress, we were having a great time and so busy in our talk that it didn't ruin the evening. On another night we may have been more bothered by this.

That aside, it was a great evening."}
{"text":"Went here as I was walking past with my girlfriend and it looked pretty busy.  The amount of choice on the menu is pretty good, although there was a note on the menu that made me wonder about the food; it said:
\"While alterations may seem easily accommodated, such requests compromise the unique characteristics of our food and the efficiency of our service.  Please respect our menu.\"    Now call me old-fashioned but isn't running a restaurant about respecting your customers and any dislikes that they might have??  I can't believe that any restaurant would be that arrogant so the only reason that I could think of for putting that on the menu would be that the food is all pre-prepared and then just heated up when someone orders it.  My suspicions were increased when we (and the tables either side of us) received our food within about 5 minutes of ordering.

The food itself was decent, not amazing but not bad either.  Portions were a little on the small side considering the prices being charged (about $17 for a pasta dish).  Service was good, we were seated straight away and served quickly (it was a Monday evening).

So, mixed feelings - however there are hardly a lack of good Italian restaurants in Toronto so I'm not sure that i would come back here."}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant doesn't accommodate their guests for allergies?! No substitutions at all!? Guests should always be catered to, without explaining themselves. Clearly the chef only knows how to make each dish a certain way and they mask it as being authentic Southern Italian cuisine. 

Ok, so I ordered a dish from the short selection I was forced to choose from. All around the table, no one was impressed with their food; it was mediocre at best. The décor was beautiful but the A/C was on full blast. Almost as if they didn't want people to notice the food - just to focus on eating fast to get out of the cold and enjoy the view. Service was cold, unprofessional (in appearance and demeanor) and full of themselves.  

At the end of it, even after speaking to several other tables, no one would return. Too many authentic restaurants in Toronto to bother with this one."}
{"text":"We had eagerly awaited our first meal at Terroni's.
With it being our 24th anniversary & based on the reviews figured we couldn't go wrong. Guess what???
Unimpressed. I ordered the rigatoni served barely warm & tasted my husband's margarherta pizza.
The word bland comes to mind. Service on the other hand specracular. Booths are reserved for 3 or more
& decor/atmosphere does not allow for intimité dinners. Results: 3 stars"}
{"text":"I've heard my friend prattle on about this place and I've also heard a lot of hype.  Apparently they serve really delicious pizza or something, so naturally given the chance I figured I'd give it a try.

Party of 4, Thursday evening arriving around 7:30, mid-October.

First, I want to come right out and say that their chillies was quite flavourful and packed a pleasant amount of heat.  We quickly consumed the first small bowl and had to ask for a refill, which our waiter promptly filled to the brim.  Finished that too, so there's something.

On to the experience - 
The location was rather packed, with the line-up extending outside the door.  Usually this is indicative of good food and good atmosphere, and my friend assured me that the line will move pretty quick.  The nice thing is that while you line-up you can take a look at the stock of items available for purchase including several jars of olive oil, pickled veggies, preserves, and the aforementioned chillies.  It is somewhat awkward in that several tables are placed right in the front where we all wait in line (there is literally about a foot and a half between the line of people and the table, just enough for a waiter to swing by or the hostess to take down names of those in line).  I felt sorry at first for those tables while we waited, and for good reason.  After waiting about half an hour, we were seated in one of those tables.  

As an aside, I want to put it out there to everyone who, at any time in their lives, plans to eat at a restaurant.  Please DO NOT stand in the door way with the door ajar, neither coming nor going, in nor out.  It was unfortunate that we had to be seated so close to the entrance and had to face the inevitable stares from hungry faces, but also had to deal with a persistent draft from inconsiderate people waiting in the doorway.  It was a chilly mid-october evening and my food cooled down faster than I could consume it.  

With regards to service, they explicitly say they will not make substitutions or alterations - although some people would take this as a \"snobby\" way of doing things (and I don't completely disagree - each person is entitled to their own tastes and we are, after all, paying them to cook a meal to satisfy ourselves, not their own sense of grandiose) in the end they are equally entitled to make such a policy.  It's not a policy that will be very popular amongst some customers, of course.  In a sense, it's basically the chef telling you what you want to eat and how you want to eat it.  Not the best arrangement, but I had no problems with this.

What I found difficult, however, was the menu.  The items were naturally named with \"authentic italian names\".  Although this made it seem more authentic, or \"real\" or even \"classier\", it made meal selection an arduous task.  Many times I simply skipped over items simply because I could not tell what they were trying to sell me on.

One of the glasses brought with a drink smelled funny - probably from the dishwasher.  Otherwise, the plates were large and the table was too small (this could either be taken as a bad thing, or a great compliment...).

To the food - 
I'm going to have to be honest and say that the food did not blow me away.  The seafood pasta was al-dente, had good flavour, but I felt it did not maximize the opportunity to blend and play with the different flavours that are there.  A single scallop, in my opinion, is being chinsy.      I chose a simple pizza with spiced sausages and some onions and scamorza cheese.  I have no problems with any of the ingredients by themselves, but my expectations was to find a pizza with a fair bit of the toppings scattered about so that I could bite into the pizza and experience the flavours together in contrast or harmony.  As it were, there were half-inch thick clumps of sausages scattered sparsely, obvious welts of scamorza, and thin slivers of onions sprinkled about.  I found the spreading of the toppings could have been more uniform.

We ordered a 5oz glass of red (cheapest in the full-bodied one @ $9) and a bellini.  The bellini arrives in a shampagne glass and was not properly blended, but otherwise the water was great.

The food, while not being terribly ground breaking or awe inspiring, was also not terrible or bland.  It had flavour and would have been perfectly fine to match a lower price point.  As it were, however, the items tended on the pricey side.  

On an aside - I also ordered the grilled calamari - came in 3 pieces on a bed of diced tomatoes and greens.  Nothing fantastic, nothing bad, it was a good palate opener but lacked character.

Overall, I think the experience could have been better (we could have had a better table, for one), and I would probably try a pasta next time as it would be more filling than pizza.  It did not help that we got a $60 ticket for a poorly marked no-parking zone.  Maybe they should stop ticketing the people who fuel the economy, and go solve some crimes, or something..."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Terroni in a year or so, and forgot why I stayed away.....
Our lunch today reminded me.....
It being 2 pm on a wednesday, we were seated right away - on the most uncomfortable retro chairs I've ever sat on (think play room blue chairs that you dog ripped apart when she was pissed you went on vacation and left her at home with your aunt)
That unsuccessful attempt at causal coolness also permeates the servcie - wait staff that are very relaxed, nonchalant and friendly, saying they can take it while holding dirty plates from another table (don't worry, I'll remember) , then getting your order wrong and protesting when you point it out ('are you sure you didn't order that?)
Ok, now the food - its ok, good in fact, but far, far from great. A ravioli that promises duck, butternut squash and figs, delivers only a few shreds of what may be duck in its tiny pockets - no hint of the figs or squash to be found
The lamb pappardelle comes with bones in the ragout - tasty but rather oily
The molten chocolate cake, not defrosted adequately in the microwave presumably, goes down as a cold ball of chocolate gew as I inadvertently swallow the centre (they took it off the bill when I answered honestly to our well meaning waitresses \"how good was that???\":)
All in all, a pretty dissapointing experience. And of course, the price (the so many mediocre Toronto restos) was astronomical - $125 for lunch for 2 with 2 apps, 2 mains and a half litre of red!!!
For a good value, incredible \"casual\" italian resto, try Mario Batalis Ottto in NYC - better than any Italian in Toronto, still maintains its causal feel, and is literally half the price.....makes me want to cry (Porter, anyone???)"}
{"text":"My first time at Terroni and I would definitely come back again!

Upon entering the restaurant, you are greeted with a nice aroma of chocolate and a great place to seat down to have a meal and bond with your friends. We were seated near the front of the restaurant where our server was helpful and nice (he kept coming back to review our water unlike other restaurants where you have to wait for a long time).

We ordered the Capaccio di Manzo which was a raw beef appetizer. Nothing to rave about because it is like eating beef sashimi.

I ordered the Ravioli di Zio Paperone which I loved! The duck inside the ravioli was tender and the sauce used for the pasta really enhanced the duck flavour. My friend ordered the Natalina pizza which he said was really good and the Cavatelli al Sugo D'Agnello which had a very strong taste of lamb.

We also ordered the latte macchiato which went really well at the end of the meal because the espresso shot didn't have a burned taste to it and the milk was nicely steamed.

Overall, my meal and the service we received at Terroni sold me on coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant in Toronto. Pizzas are great but the appetizers, pastas and other entrees are sensational. When you sit you get great bread and olive oil to munch away. Good beer and wine selection and to finish outstanding tiramisu or other desserts. Well worth the high price."}
{"text":"The pizza is not as rich as other places and the line ups are so long. Why wait for this place on a Saturday? It's best to go somewhere different."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I chose to come here for lunch...twice! Both experience were great. The waiters/waitresses are always so friendly and I never had an issue with that. This restaurant is pretty big; it has both indoor and outdoor seating, which explains why this location is pretty busy. The dishes taste amazing - I totally recommend their sandwiches.

I took one star away for the long wait for our food. We waited 30 minutes (or more) for two sandwiches, which in my opinion is slow service."}
{"text":"I can often be found at Terroni, as long as you arrive early and aren't in a rush it's the perfect meal. The service is always great and the food, incredibly consistent. It's authentic. It's homey and it's delicious. Make sure you ask for the hot peppers. Amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely my regular go to place when I can't decide where to eat. It should be noted that the pasta is weighed.. so ordering something like the ravioli will seem like a minuscule portion. I usually order the Spaghetti Ca' Pummarola N'Goppa- simple but delicious. The pizzas are the standard wood-fire pizzas. 

Also LOVE those Terroni hot peppers. It's lack crack . I put that stuff on everything and probably go through at least three jars a year. Apparently they now also sell them at the Drake General Store."}
{"text":"As an impromptu dinner date, this was a very nice place.  Very busy though for a Wednesday night.  Constant flow of people.

My wife who grew up in Italy thought that it was one of the better Italian restaurants in TO. Plus the waiter spoke Italian which is a plus in her book. Service was prompt and efficient! Personally I thought the food was very good even compared to the numerous restaurants we went to in Italy. Very comparable and sufficient authentic for me.

To start with we had the Mezzo e Mezzo. You can't go wrong with honey, walnuts, hazelnuts, cheese, and prosciutto.  My wife had the Bucatini Amaticiana which I tried a little bit of and it was very nice. The Pasta was done right and the sugo (sauce; Tomato) wasn't overwhelming. Perfect balance. 

I had the Angolotti which I would recommend if you want to avoid a heavy tomato sauce.  The meat was done right and didn't smell 'meaty' if you know what I mean. Perfectly well done and the taste was delicate but not to the point I would loose the flavour.

For closing I had a doppio (double expresso) with Torta Calda.  Very delicious and again my chocolate demon was tamed that evening.  My wife had an Affogato which was nice as well.

All in all, we would go back to this restaurant and for my wife who is very picky about Italian food that is saying something.  I would give it a 5 star but the atmosphere was a tad to busy for a dinner date but I can see it to be an excellent place for a bunch of friends.

Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"We booked the private room for my bachelorette party dinner. The room usually seats 12 but they let us squish 14. Food was great and service was excellent considering the large group. They even sent us the sommelier to help with wine selections. Terroni is known for not allowing customers to make substitutions to the menu so I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to accommodate my friend's food allergies with a special vegan menu. I guess you have to ask for it.
I had the caprese salad and agnolotti. Caprese was good but I upgraded to the buffalo mozzarella and I did not see any difference between that and the regular mozzarella, so maybe pass on that. The agnolotti portion size was on the smallish side, but I was still full. Wouldn't recommend it if you are starving.
Overall, a fun time. I would go back."}
{"text":"In a word awesome!  Authentic Italian cuisine.  Tables are a bit on top of each other but the food is excellent.  Great wine list as well. My go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Terroni. The food can be good, but after going once it quickly gets boring. Agree with many of the other comments about the attitude on service. I can't stand how they won't make any modifications or won't even cut your pizza when you get take-out. You can have a good meal here, but more often than not I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and service, but it looks like they don't like babies! No changing tables? Not so family friendly after all"}
{"text":"Terroni is a classic standby that never disappoints. I always go with at least two people, so that someone can order a pizza.  I prefer pasta over pie, but I'll never turn down a slice. I used to order the pasta alla Norma -- that's eggplant pasta, which was always on-point. Delicious cubes of un-greasy eggplant in a tomato sauce (or tomatoe, if you're Dan Quayle). I was disappointed they took it off the menu. Before that. I was into the garganelli pasta with ham, but that too is off the menu. I usually go for a salad and the simple tomato pasta with a jug of wine. Desserts are always perfect, too. Sucks that they don't take reservations, but that's how the city goes. Oh, and I finally visited the Victoria location. The room is in a beautiful converted bank building -- impressive and lovely."}
{"text":"Don't go there if you're the type of person who's a little use to having a simple request granted regarding the dish you just ordered...like say easy on the sauce or maybe can i have a little extra sauce on the side? Perhaps you enjoy a pad of butter with your bread think again because the answer is simply \"no we don't serve buttér\" The bread     B T W  can be purchased for take out to be enjoyed at home at the end of your meal for only 6 dollars. I MUST say though that the bread is DIVINE! Financially for myself it would depend on what day of the week it was that I went to Torroni's if I'd buy the bread? If you are partial to Coke to drink its all they've got...otherwise if you'd care for a bevy other than Coke they do offer San Pellegrino is mostly every flavor! The pizza there is MARVELOUS!!! If you like yours cut into slices...again dont ask IT DOESNT COME CUT AND THE KITCHEN WILL NOT SLICE IT FOR YOU so learn how to use a knife or fold that sucker up and go to town. Please...read the menu...you are forewarned that all of Torroni's quirky little rules are printed in the menu somewhere. I had to allow my tastes buds to take over and rate Torroni's food and I have to add most importantly that the food there is a something outta this world delicious! EVERYTHING that went passed my lips and made its way into my mouth was absolutely divine!!! Excellently and expertly prepared food and I would highly recommend it if you arent too uptight to let little things slide by the way side! I tried the cured meat board, cheese board, bread, bread sticks, tarallini n olives the calamari..OMG they were the BEST CALAMARI I've ever had the pleasure eating, and I eat calamari almost everywhere I go! I ordered the Margarita pizza and an arugula salad on top of a chickpea pancake...the salad was perfectly dressed with little nuggets of fresh walnut pieces. I was supping with 13 others that night who all ordered something different and EVERYTHING that made its way to our table looked and tasted great. I just couldn't get over the kitchens refusal to accommodate small requests so I had to take a star away from them...it has nothing to do with taste or quality of the food...just so ppl know what they can expect when choosing Torroni's........."}
{"text":"I went here recently for the first time, but only for dessert. It was sooo good! I can't wait to go back and eat a full meal. Five of us shared 3 desserts and it was heavenly. I'm so glad I got to try so many at once!
We got the tiramisu (self-explanatory deliciousness), Bomba Calda (a deep fried pastry bun thing with custard in it and a nutella dipping sauce), and these mini fried donut things filled with nutella and a side of ice cream. I also ordered an cappuccino which was great.
All the desserts were delicious.
The atmosphere was laid back and the service was fast, efficient.

I now need to make plans to go back and eat a full meal. So much yummy Italian food in my future :) memories of Italy!"}
{"text":"I haven't had such great service on the patio however, the times that I've sat at the bar I've had a fantastic time with the courteous bartenders.

The pandolce are delicious spherical pancakes that make for a great light breakfast to share with a friend. Their espresso is well done, and the beers on tap are top notch.

It's a favourite of mine and I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's an OK place, usually packed with people and long lines to be seated so make reservations. The quality of ingredients is good but not many options outside of the meat or seafood options."}
{"text":"We ordered a few entrees and the food was ok. The pizza is a little lacking and kinda rubbery. I've been to this location twice and one time was good and the other time our waitress was horrid - messed up the orders badly and then was really rude. I chalk that up to her having a bad day, but there's better places in this area."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend to run a local 15k. Since I knew a bunch of friends were also traveling here to run as well, I suggested that we all meet up beforehand to chat and carbo-load. I didn't have a lot of expectations about this place since I was unfamiliar with the local cuisine; all that mattered to me was food and good company.

Upon arriving, I was immediately struck by the décor from the outside; it didn't look like a normal restaurant but rather an old post office or office building (reading the other reviews it looks like it is a refurbished court house). Walking inside, I awaited the arrival of the others within the group in the chic bar area. As we got seated, I was struck by the high ceilings in the dining area, as well as the motif on the walls. I sat at the table and immediately I see in front of me a set of voodoo dolls on the wall. I'm guessing that they were going for some sort of theme but it was disturbing to see that as you eat. *shiver*.

Many of the gals within the group ordered the specialty individual pizzas. I didn't want to go for anything heavy so I went with \" Spaghetti in Canna a Mare\": spaghetti with fresh clams and mussels, calamari, scallops and tiger shrimp in light tomato sauce. Oh.My.God. Light on the food, the most tender pasta I have ever tasted. 

For a large group, the time to table was excellent and the staff was so pleasant.  The next day, I had conversations with some of the locals about our dining experience and they all raved about how they loved this place. A great choice for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Lunch outside in the back patio-split a caprese salad and margarita pizza. Great Italian wines, great service, super charming. The pastas looked pretty awesome as well.  Really loved this place."}
{"text":"Great space, solid food and immaculate service.

So my sister came down with her four kids (all under 7) and we wanted to celebrate my brother in laws birthday. I booked Terroni knowing Italian can be a crowd pleaser and the adults (7 in total) still wanted a fun night out to celebrate.

I mentioned we had kids in our party and some dietary considerations and so they have us a separate dining area and Hannah. Having us sit aside was great because we had our own space and didn't have to worry about the kids and Hannah was incredibly patient and considerate throughout the evening. Everyone was more than happy with their meals (pizza was popular) and I loves that my seafood pasta was full of mussels, shrimp and calamari. A little chilli oil? Sorted within seconds.

All in all everyone had a great night out and Hannah was integral to it - I don't write reviews often but I felt this was necessary considering her efforts. And thanks for the birthday biscotti as well!"}
{"text":"After living in toronto for numerous years and hearing how fantastic terroni's is, I finally went there a few months ago (twice). Both times I didn't really enjoy it, and the only reason I went back is because I literally live right across the street and am a very lazy person.

First, there are some positive things about this place. The building itself is beautiful and the servers are all very attractive. This place is ALWAYS packed - which could be a good thing if you're into that (personally I'm not) and they have a few sets of communal dining tables (long tables were you sit beside other people). I could see how this could be a fun experience, however it does not appeal to me in the slightest.

For me, my biggest complaint was that because the place was so busy and the tables so close together, I had difficulty talking and kept getting distracted by other tables.

I must admit, that the food is pretty good, however I feel it is over priced for what you get. The first time I went I had pizza, which was unremarkable, but the second time I had a lamb pasta dish which was actually really great.

Also, I didn't find the service particularily great. I asked our server to recommend a bottle of wine and was very disappointed with what she picked - it didn't seem to go with what we ordered at all, and again, seemed way overpriced.

All in all, I wouldn't go back to terroni's. However, I feel like this is understandable since I am not the demographic that terroni's appeals to. Also, this place doesn't take reservations, which is frustrating."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Good gluten free options and pretty well priced for a trendy place on Queen West. We were initially seated at a table in the middle of the patio, which was annoying, but we asked to be moved and the hostess accommodated our request. We had a very pleasant meal on the patio."}
{"text":"Love Terroni. Great Menu options. In my opinion its the best pizza in TO. We had the little private room in the back  there were 8 of us. It was great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The pizzas here are amazing.  Home made, made from scratch pizzas are always the best.  The ambiance is great and compliments well with the Italian food.  A great place to buy Italian cooking ingredients while just sitting around waiting for your food.  Only complaint is that sometimes the pizzas aren't consistent.  Most of the time they're perfect, whereas other times the crust can be extremely dry and crusty.  Other than that, check out this restaurant if you've never been here before."}
{"text":"I think this is a beautiful space (although it is very loud).  The service was good.  The food was very uneven:  I had an amazing appetizer, a horrible main, and a horrible dessert. I made the mistake of ordering fish - it was dry and overdone and awful and the tiramisu was drowning in cream and had no flavour.  Beautiful space, good service, but very uneven food.  My friends who ordered the pasta were very happy."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and the food was sub par to say the least. We started with the cheese board which had about 8 ridiculously small pieces of cheese and some grapes for $20. Definitely not worth it and the cheese was flavourless. Our mains were less than exciting and extremely over priced. The atmosphere was poor, maybe because we went later, but there was no music playing and it seemed strangely quiet. Our server was good and service was quick but definitely won't be back. Not worth the hype or price."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, service and atmosphere. They don't take reservations on some of their busier nights would be my only issue."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this restaurant is great - i would have given it a four if the server had gotten our order correct and if i wasn't given attitude at the end when I asked for a takeout box for my pizza. 

We were a party of two, ordered: 

Appetizer:

Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo 17.95
selection italian and local cured meats (i.e. smaller version of of Tagliere del Salumiere -  17.95) and italian cheese served with honey and homemade jam (i.e. Tagliere di Formaggi - 17.95)

2 Entrées:

Ravioli di Zio Paperone 17.95
homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano

Puzza (16.95)
white pizza with mozzarella, italian mascarpone, gorgonzola, mushrooms, italian ham
 BUT was given Polentona (16.95) 
tomato, mozzarella, fontina, speck (smoked prosciutto), pinenuts

I realized how ignorant I am of other cultures while I was here - really wished for a beginner's special / introduction, especially when it came to eating our appetizer. I asked the server which order we should eat all the meat and cheese in and he said left to right, but didn't recommend any specific combinations. It was definitely fun to try all the different meat and cheese but there were some moments when we were like .. so how do we eat this. My friend found that this cheese (strong, parmasan-y) went well with the dried (yet moist...)pear and bread.  I found that bread + the pear went well with gorgonzola (definitely an aquired taste - that cheese was really strong). Next time i try this dish, I will order some wine just to see how it would taste different :)


So I mentioned the wrong order earlier - I ordered Puzza (and i'm pretty sure i heard the server repeat \"Puzza\" after I said it) but received a Polentona instead. The worse part is - we didn't figure that out until we saw the bill (on the bill it said i ordered the polentona instead). This made me really sad, it was my fault for not remembering what I had ordered, but at the same time, the server could have clarified what i said :(. 

Our server kept us watered, but that's what all servers should do. He could have totally added more value to our dining experience by maybe asking to see if we ever ate at Terroni before and given us recommendations and suggestions (and tips on what to eat first). I hate to mention tips in reviews, but honestly, if he did that, I would have been happy to give at least 20% tip.

Final comment on the service. When I asked for a box, the server said, \"What?! you only at a bit\" in a very serious tone (I looked up to see if he was just teasing but he wasn't.... he looked really insulted actually). so i told him: Well this is really good but i can't finish it now, that's why i want to take it home with me. Shouldn't he be ... happy that I'm not wasting food? I guess the server wasn't used to serving people in my friend and i's age group - all the other patrons were at least 35+, so he didn't know what to say...  oh and last thing - he didn't bring a dessert menu OR suggest any wines (lost the opportunity to upsell, mio amico).

Stuff to keep in mind: 

pizza's huge (but thin crusted) and they won't cut it up for you (i heard that they actually refused to take it back in the kitchen to cut it up because italians ate pizza with knife and fork).

Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo  was filling for even two people (I'd say three would be a great number to share the portion that they provided). It's worth a try! 
Ravioli was good as well :) - pasta portions weren't as big. 

The Adelaide location only takes reservations for 6pm and 9pm - it started getting busy around 730pm. 

They have the meat hung up on display in the bar area (in display case of course), which is really cool. 

They have a Terroni magazine, which talks about italian food :) It's for free (and has yummy food pictures!)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Terroni for a romantic dinner and we definitely got it!Great atmosphere and vibe. I was expecting the service to be slow based on how busy it was but it was excellent. Impressed by how knowledgeable my server was of the menu. Wine prices are a tad high but the delicious food made up for it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Terroni is amazing!
You can tell that they know what they are doing when it comes to Italian food. Almost everything is home made....you can taste it. The pastas are delicious. The dandelion pasta is beyond amazing. Such simple dishes with such great flavours. I would definitely call it comfort food. Pizzas are really good as well and they have a huge variety. They also have a bunch of great apps and their meat and cheese board is amazing to share. 

The service has always been great. The staff are very knowledgeable on their food and wine (which yes can be very confusing if you do not know Italian wine). But I've always been recommended great wine and its nice to try something different for a change! 
Super friendly staff. Sometimes they are extremely busy since Terroni is almost always full. Food always comes quickly even when its a full restaurant. You can have a full meal and be out in half an hour. 

I respect their no substitution policy. A lot of places in Toronto are doing this now...and with a menu as big as Terronis, you can find something on their that you like!!! 

Always a great vibe in there and awesome food and drinks! Love it :)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto.  The quality has always been simple, fresh and consistent.  I never been to other branches but this location has always kept me satisfied.  The food here is never over the top or fancy, but it's always fresh and well executed.  On our last visit we had pizza margherita, seafood spaghetti and grilled calamari.  We ended our evening with tiramisu.  The service here has always been helpful and friendly.  The layout and design might seem a bit clumsy, but has a rustic, homey feel.  They also implemenent this new text alert system which they'll text you when table becomes available.  I really like it because we can walk around trendy Queen W. until our table is ready as oppose to having to line up at the door in the past."}
{"text":"If you are looking for reasonably good, somewhat rustic Italian food, Terroni may just be the place for you.
I have visited and dined at Terroni several times, and just like all my previous visits, my most recent dining experience was quite positive.
This location on Adelaide consists of a large cavernous room which can be somewhat loud and noisy when the restaurant is busy and full (which seems to be most of the time), however, this seems to lend the room some energy and it's never so loud that it's difficult to hold a conversation.
To start, the wine list at Terroni consists of a large number of exclusively Italian wines from numerous locations throughout the country.  The wine list is varied and it appeared to me that there were a number of interesting wines that would not necessarily be available elsewhere.  I ordered a nice red from Piedmont which I enjoyed quite a lot, however, I am hardly a wine connoisseur, so you may want to take that into account.
For starters, we shared the Insalatina di Polipo (seared octopus with potatoes, olives, tomatoes, and greens).  This dish was quite good.  The octopus was cooked perfectly as it was quite tender and flavours worked very well together.  All in all, a great start to the meal.
For dinner, I had the Tonnarelli alla Norcina (pasta with black truffles and sausage).  Once again, this dish was very good.  It was a little oily for my personal tastes, however, the flavours were superb!  The sausage and black truffle complemented each other very well.  On a side note, does anyone know why truffles can't be farmed?  Seems like that would be a very successful venture and a virtual license to print money!  In any case, my wife had the Funghi Assoluti (oyster mushroom, parmigiano, and balsamic on a bed of arugula).  This dish is actually a starter, however, my wife had it as her main.  Once again, a great dish which was well executed.
Following the main course we were quite full and satisfied, so unfortunately, there was no room for dessert which means I cannot comment on this aspect of the meal.
Overall, the service was attentive and friendly and this has been my experience every time I have had the pleasure to dine at Terroni.
The full menu is available online if you view the Terroni website and for the quality of the food and wine which is available, along with the pleasurable dining experience, I would say that the prices represent reasonably good value.
Terroni is definitely worth a visit and once you try it, you may find yourself coming back for repeat visits.
Final verdict: Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"Went to Terroni's after reading mostly good reviews for our 1 month marriage anniversary. My Aussie wife is in love with pasta and I wanted her to try one of our best. We were very sadly disappointed. We don't eat pork and after mentioning that to the server it seemed like we disappointed him. The menu was hard to read because they tried so hard to seem authentic Italian that they forgot to add enough English. Our server couldn't think of any pasta dish other than 1 that didn't have pork in it. Instead of helping us he provided us with the reason they have pork in everything, \"because it is the best and most flavorful meat\". I found 2 pasta dishes that didn't have any pork in it. We ordered a Billini, the beef carpacio, the duck ravioli and spinich ricotta ravioli. The bread wasn't great. The carpacio was the best dish although it doesn't come with truffle oil. When the main dishes came there was literally no sauce and about 10 pieces of ravioli. We had to flag the waiter for little while to get extra parmesan to make the food taste better. He never came by to check on us. 
Over all, very mediocre food, very few options if you don't eat pork, garbage service. Can't see myself ever going back. There's more than enough good Italian restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ok food - ordered rigatoni with fried egg plant with tomato sauce, nothing special, just what you expect. My friend ordered pappardelle with spicy sausage, the sausage was not spicy at all. 

Service - it's my second time in this location, and even before our food was served, I realized why I didn't come here often. The server wasn't attentive at all. 

For the price I paid, I would much rather go to somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food in an amazing open air space.   This place has a buzz that's hard to duplicate.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Love the meat plate , truffle pasta was plentiful of truffles. Yum!! Atmosphere is great , it's obvious everyone is having a great time . Server is very attentive . Great recommendation on the wine . My own mini complaint is the desserts were all on the overly sweet side . But definitely will come back and try the pizzas."}
{"text":"If you like a thin crispy gourmet pizza, then this is a place for you!
I like the atmosphere, the service is good, and so is the food...yum.
Be prepared to spend a little extra at this place, its worth it, and perhaps come a bit earlier :)"}
{"text":"Pizza crust was scorched black. Server told me that's the way they do it in Italy. I've been to Italy several times and never had burnt pie like that. They refused to do more than make excuses. $13 with tax and tip for a kids Spaghetti!? Overpriced queen street schlock."}
{"text":"Whenever I want good pasta, I'll head to Terroni. I really like the decor at the Adelaide location. The puppets on the wall reflect the history of the building, which is pretty cool. Abit morbid...neverthless, interesting. My favorite dish is simply spaghetti and tomato sauce. Freshly made pasta and fresh tomato sauce....so simple...so good. 

I tried the 3 locations: St Clair, Queen West and Adelaide. All consistently good."}
{"text":"Food is OK, spaghetti was not even cooked well. Waiter was rude and hard to get hold of. Overally, prob won't come back"}
{"text":"Food is always alway good. 
Service is to be desired. Lots of young people who think that rolling eyes is part of the job description. Faire de snob. 
Ive lived in this area my whole life. And most places are friendly and accommodating. This place isn't."}
{"text":"Ok, just briefly. I used to love the place, and would be there at least once a week. Ok, they got more expensive -- but I still went. The service was moody, but I decided it was charming. Today I went again after a year's absence, and they somehow lost their charm... they are too arrivée. And Libretto's pizza is, I am sorry to say, much better. And cheaper!"}
{"text":"Terroni is totally amazin'!  Authentic and delicious, great atmosphere, better service!  Great wine, great food, can't get better than Terroni."}
{"text":"Meh. Gum chewing waitress Jane was a turn off. Food was overpriced and underseasoned. Spicy sausage was anything but. We felt rushed when the server removed our plates with food uneaten, then asked if we were done"}
{"text":"Aweful experience. They put olive pits on my pizza. They wouldn't offer Parmesan cheese for pasta and pizza or chilli flakes to spice up their boring sauce. The server was a snob and unattentive. The space is beautiful though and well decorated. Too bad you can't eat ambiance!"}
{"text":"Great room, food and service. Young crowd and so busy it was hard to talk over the bustle."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Italian food go to place but after having dined here I discovered that the wait staff is treated so unfairly. Seems that their breaks have been cut back to 15 minutes even after working a full shift. Management totally disregards labour laws that require you give workers a 30 minute break after working a 5 hour shift. Wait staff are forced to work a double shift even when their contract says they cannot. What gets to me is that the servers tips are docked for any problems. Can you believe it? Lee restaurant was using this unacceptable practice but stopped and here I find out another establishment that I dine at is doing the same thing. These poor people are too afraid to complain because they do not want to lose their job. Well I'm not eating here anymore until management treat staff fairly and with respect. I wish someone would stand up and call the Ontario labour board and CBC to do an investigation in this shady place."}
{"text":"In meeting my fabbbbbbulously fabulous friends I studied nutrition with
in Toronto, they decided to take me to Terroni.

I knew it was going to be a great big fat Italian experience upon
opening the glass doors. Who cares what the food tastes like! This
place looked incredible. High ceilings, walls of what I'm sure are the
best wines, and wood detailing with rich colors. Wait, it smelled way
too good in there to not care about the food.

I knew we were in a serious spot when asked if I wanted my water iced,
sparkling, bottled, etc etc. It always catches me off guard as I'm
usually not the fanciest of pants. The waitress was somewhat alright I
suppose. Wasn't the friendliest and my friends agreed. She did however
bring us fabulous bread and olive oil. Something so simple yet so
pleases me.

I was rather overwhelmed with the menu, primarily because I sucked at
pronoucing things and was afraid the waitress would kick me out if I
didn't say it right. We all went with pizzas and I opted for the Li
Pecuri with tomato, mozzarella, goat cheese, sundried tomatoes,
arugola, and parmigiano. It was ammmmmazingly delish! Still hasn't
beat the best pizza I've ever had (Pizzeria Regina in Boston) but it
was tasty all the same.

My belly senses (equivalent to spidey senses) tell me I need to eat
some different pasta dishes here. I fully intend to when I return some
day.

Until then, I'll dream of traditional bolognese ragù."}
{"text":"The other night decided to try downtown location of Terroni. Got to say that this location is quite nice and is packed just like the midtown location. The menu is a bit pricey but the food is always great. Got the Grilled Calamari as an apetizer and it was nice big portion of Calamai on top a good portioned salad. For the main course tried the Salmon Pizza which of course was too much as the pizzas are huge at Terroni's, but it was so good that I took the leftovers home (They do not have many options with meat if that is something you're interested in). My gf had a couple of Bellinis which I would like to mention, at $10 per bellini the price is a bit too high for the small champagne glass size drinks she got. Also the bellinis here are not that cold/frozen as one might be used to, but the taste was still quite good. They have a really great wine selection though. Just a reminder that they do absolutely no modifications to the menu, ie. you can't really add or customize a dish which is not always the best. Taking off a star because the service was a bit slow and could be improved."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always on point. The location is awesome; I especially love the patio in the summer. 
The only thing that would make this place a lot better is an improvement with their service. Every single time I come, my friends and I do not like the service; the waiters never check on you or ask if anything is okay. Every time we have to flag down our waiter for help, even when it is not busy.
Disregarding the service, this place is overall awesome and I will keep coming back for the atmosphere / food !"}
{"text":"This Toronto chain of over priced and overrated Italian eats needs to rethink it's attitude. It's pasta is slightly better than the average off College Italian restaurant, their pizza is a step beyond PizzaVille and their meat dishes are reminiscent of frozen lean cuisines. 

Food aside, what really gets me is their attitude. They don't serve diet sodas or allow drinks to be garnished with lemon or lime, because \"that's not how they do it in Italy.\"  I've been to Italy and I sure as hell been to more authentic Italian restaurants in the GTA and their is no shortage of diet cokes with limes."}
{"text":"I am generally not too crazy about Terroni, but, the roof top patio at this place is a killer. I went there for lunch one day and the view, the comfortable setting and the decor made me feel like I was on beach in a four star hotel. The service was ok and the food is typical terroni: good, but nothing spectacular for what they charge and claim. I however was impressed by my server's knowledge of their wines. My go to patio from now on, specially since it was not too crowded. There is also a table on the second floor balcony (patio is on the 3rd floor)  which is for larger groups (8-10) that seemed pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"This place bordered on 5 stars, in all honesty. The pastas are all homemade and the chefs developed excellent flavors with a Northern Italian sensibility. I went with a huge group and tried a LOT of the menu. I tried the pizza (prosciutto) and found it to be more basic. The appetizers ranged from excellent (charcuterie) to overcooked and bland (fried calamari). 

I didn't have anything bad, for sure, just some slight misfires. The wine list had a lot of Italian producers that don't have large, if any, US distribution, so that was awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food in a beautiful setting, particularly in the summer when the patio is open. 

I've had several pasta dishes at Terroni and none has disappointed. The lemon spaghetti is lovely with a glass of white wine in the summer. 

On my last visit, I sat under the large old tree on the patio and ordered the pasta dish \"alla Norcina\" ($25) with a sparkling red. (What a pleasant surprise to find sparkling red on the menu). The pasta had a very nice chew and the sauce was delectable.

The service was friendly and fairly efficient, though a friend did wait 10-15 minutes for a glass of beer in a slow mid-afternoon period. 

My only criticism of Terroni is that it is expensive; you are paying for the ambiance as well as the food. However, your mileage may vary and considering how lovely the ambiance is, it doesn't seem unfair."}
{"text":"I do love Terroni.  I love the Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo starter - delicious and perfect for sharing.  The pig that became the prosciutto was clearly massage and played Mozart every day of its life.  The Caprese salad is divine.  My favourite pasta dishes are the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare (beautiful seafood) and the Pappardelle alla Iosa (with ground sausage, button mushrooms, and peas...yum).  The C't Mang pizza is fantastic.  But this really does irk me:

\"While alterations may seem easily accommodated, such requests compromise the unique characteristics of our food and the efficiency of our service.  Please respect our menu.\" 

This makes me want to say \"fuck you - I'm the customer\".  I'd like to think if I had an allergy, they'd risk their \"efficiency\" for me.  And god help me when I asked for some balsamic vinegar for my Caprese salad.  I'm not *allowed* to have it, nor ask for cheese if I order seafood.

I feel badly for the servers who are clearly trained to deny the customers what they want.

Growing up with a English-Canadian father and a Japanese mother born and raised in Tokyo, I watched their silly dinner custom, over and over: my dad would pour soy sauce over his bowl of white rice, and my mother would tell him \"you're NOT supposed to DO that.\"  My dad didn't care the rice is supposed to remain pure (unless it's fried rice - *then* you can add soy), and act as a palate cleanser.  He just liked it that way.  

So I sympathise with the purist/snob when it comes to food prep, but people are bound to want food their own way.  And an establishment that understands this will respect the CUSTOMER and not the \"integrity\" of their own menu.

Service is sometimes good, sometimes friendly, sometimes indifferent.  Avoid peak hours; they don't take reservations.

The food is good, though.  And it's photogenic."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Very snobby and don't dare be over 50!
Food is fine but the service is pretentious and rude."}
{"text":"I came here with my girl friends the next night after an amazing wedding the day before and it was prime catch up time - to the point where we would keep forgetting to check out the menu and the waitress had to come to us 3 times.

First of all, I absolutely loved their Funghi Assoluti! So good! I love mushrooms and balsamic dressing! Something about that flavor of the arugola is so distinct that I can't really decide if I like it on its own or not. But together, yum :)

For my main course, I had the Ravioli di Zio Paperone (stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted peppernut squash, parmigiani and sauteed with porcini). Does that sound hella delicious or what? There were some mushrooms in there too and the sauce was so good at coating the ravioli but didn't take away from the gentle flavor of the duck confit.

What can I say, Italian food (especially ravioli) is a weakness of mine.

I wonder how long it'll be before I return to Toronto. Miss you guys!"}
{"text":"Nice Vegetarian Pizza ! My friend said the truffle spaghetti is amazing!!"}
{"text":"First time in Toronto, first time at Terroni.
Awesome space, cool bar, live DJ
Great pizza, expensive drinks and wine list starts at $40."}
{"text":"Deafeningly loud.  Slightly dark.  I can hear the music (?) but not my dinner partner.  Fine print on menu unreadable in this light.  Have cold and cannot shout so afraid I may starve tonight.  Hipness belongs before dinner or after dinner but not AT dinner.  What a pity, since the food is so good here, always.  But it's become Thug Cuisine-- you get fed while being beaten up!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this location a few times as well as the one on Queen and overall Ive always enjoyed my experiences.  Their grilled calamari starter is amazing and I always enjoy the pizzas.  I know people get put off by their strict standards (I went with a girlfriend once who couldnt believe they refused to give her balsamic vinegar to dunk her bread iin) but it doesnt bug me.  They have a pretty extensive menu so if you dont like an ingredient you can surely fnd something else.  Overall a steady choice."}
{"text":"My family & I came here while we were in town for Thanksgiving weekend.  We were seated upstairs which was nice since it was less hectic & noisy compared to the downstairs area.  As I was perusing the menu, I didn't see anything eye catching so me & my sister split a margherita pizza while my parents split a mushroom pizza.  When both pies came out, they looked phenomenal.  The crust was perfectly thin & crispy without being burnt & there was just the right amount of cheese & sauce.  We promptly ordered a 2nd pie since the 1st one was devoured in about 5 mins.  The service was fine, waitress was attentive.  I never thought I'd find such amazing pizza in Canada but I was proven wrong.  Now if they would just expand & open up a location near Chicago..."}
{"text":"This is my least favourite Terroni location.  There are so many good restaurants not far from here that it's surprising the customer service is so terrible.  Servers and hostesses could crack a smile or try a little bit harder.  The food is alright, but really no need to come back here again."}
{"text":"The only reason we came to this place was for the outdoor patio seating which is really pretty at night with lights and opens up into a quiet courtyard. That's exactly what we got.

We are vegetarians so our meny options were somewhat limited, but a few of us ordered the pizza. It was decent, nothing spectacular. If you want good pizza, go to Libretto.

Another ordered the salad and another got the lemon spaghetti which was bland -- sort of to be expected.

Our waiter was friendly and patient as we waited for others in our party to join. The prices aren't bad considering it's downtown and the portions were pretty generous. Pistachio gelato was good. 

Beware that they won't add anything to dishes. For example, if you want a cheese pizza with olives, they won't add olives to a margherita for you. They will only omit things from an existing dish... 

Some of the staff were a bit awkward-- the hostess asked us pretty much to leave after 2 hours because another party was waiting for our table. It would have been fine, but at the time,  we had already paid and were just waiting for a few friends to come out of the bathroom so we could go. That's never pleasant. 

As an aside, the inside of the restaurant is equally as intriguing as the patio. Has a unique medieval sort of rustic feel to it... high ceilings. 

The building itself is pretty amazing (the bathrooms are converted jail cells) and we went upstairs to where we thought a gallery was and were awkwardly told we couldn't be up there by a girl who wasn't really paying attention and probably shouldn't have let us wander in anyway.

Overall -- food is nothing special. It does have a cool atmosphere though."}
{"text":"I like this place.  hands down its the pinnacle of Toronto happy place for me.

I'm not out west and long for this ex-jail type italian pizzeria pasta excitement!  The decor is spot on, the food was great (I had the seafood pasta, spicy).  Price was good, service was top notch, I expected less.  The patio was really good and I imagine those summer nights would be bangin' out there...  We went for a lunch on a Sunday so they weren't too busy...  Inside or out, the seating is well appointed.  I will return again one day... perhaps for a dinner and some drinks instead to verify my aspirations of ambiance.

Until then, keep the seats warm for me."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Waiter refused to serve me cheese with my pasta because it had seafood.  I've had this dish several times and had cheese but apparently the chef won't allow it here because it ruins the taste. If I prefer the taste I don't see what that should matter to anyone else.  

To top it off it was my birthday.  I would of appreciated the disclaimer before I ordered this dish.  Totally ruined my meal.

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive friendly staff, good location crappy patio average wine list. It's a little on the pricey side but worth it. This is one of my favorite places on Queen! I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"@Terroni's on Adelaide. I was out with my family last night for my birthday dinner and one meal ordered was the Seafood linguine. It was not recommended to have cheese on this dish as the chef instructed the waitress that the customers should be told and that no cheese should be eaten on the pasta with seafood. The person who ordered this ate all the seafood but wanted cheese on her pasta. She asked for some and as the poor waiter (another waiter) started to grate, the waitress firmly made him stop. The problem is they were insisting and forgot that the customer is always right. We asked for the manager 'Kurt' apologized but still insisted that that is the way it is served and no cheese is to be added.
He professed 'customer service' but actually they are lacking in customer service. We spent money on food, bottles of expensive wine and we left with a very bad taste in our mouths. After voicing our concerns, we were asked to leave. Believe me we are not going back!"}
{"text":"I had a taste of my friend's pasta, which was decent, but the pizza here is truly spectacular. Very thin crust, cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for this place since the reviews were so good. We went for dinner around 5 pm and felt like were being rushed, the waitress kept harassing us to order our food even though we had probably sat for 5 minutes. None of the staff were friendly. After we did order our food we received it within 7 minutes, which made me think it wasn't very fresh and it didn't taste fresh either. I ordered the Garganelli Geppetto, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. I had a lava cake type of dessert which was actually really good and I enjoyed it. That was the only good part. Would not be going back here."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Came here for brunch and it seemed like all of the servers were distracted and/or high! Not sure what was going on but it was a Saturday morning... the food was very average... not sure how bland Italian like this survives in Toronto but I think it only survives because of the location. The manager also kept dropping glasses and seemed very out of it. What is with this staff?! 

The scene is full of patrons who look like they just rolled out of bed in their $10,000 coat, but didn't bother to comb the rat's nest on their head or fix themselves up to look half decent. Very bizarre."}
{"text":"Gnocchi and rabbit special was delish. Service is superb. Bravo."}
{"text":"If you are a masochist, and enjoy being treated poorly by arrogant staff that think they deserve to simply be rich by virtue of their birth, then you have found the right place!

Truly the worst service I have experienced, any where in the world (no small feat). The food isn't bad, but could be presented slightly better.

If the staff wasn't so terrible, this place might have actually been a pretty decent place to take out a date or a night out with friends, too bad!"}
{"text":"I liked the decor of the restaurant but to be honest, I was not too impressed as I had high expectation of the place. The service was okay, nothing wrong but nothing amazed me...And I thought the dish was a bit overpriced, especially Ravioli, wines because of the small portion size. but the highlight of our dishes was tiramisu and espresso. I definitely recommend to try their tiramisu, not overly sweet and good portion size too. Perfect for sharing with two."}
{"text":"Food was OK, but the service here stinks. On weeknights you may see your server a few times with a bit of a wait, but good luck on the weekend - even early it's difficult to get anyone to pay attention to you.  It might be worth it if the food was fantastic, but nothing was impressive and the olive oil that came with the bread was downright astringent."}
{"text":"I give it 2 because the place was absolutely gorgeous but the food was not up to the standard of the atmosphere and price. 

The service was ehh at best, waited like ten minutes to get seated and there was no one and I really do mean no one there, it was a slow day so no justification there. 

LETS get to the real part FOOOD! Honestly speaking it sucked, if you're Italian or from New York which I am it literally tasted like nothing. I'm not kidding when I say the pizza we ordered (Quattro stagiano or something like that) tasted like nothing, the pasta was tasteless as well. 

FOR THE SERVICE AND FOOD ITS EXTREMELY OVERPRICED! 

I would maybe have a drink here but that's about it, I really do not recommend eating here if you want good food."}
{"text":"It's close by my place in TO, so been 4-5 times. Walked out on account of slow service one of those times. 2-3 other times have been decent. Most recently, put up with another aggressive attempt at selling bottled water. Wanted us to order wine before food. 

We ordered food, then the server knew little of the wines on the daily menu. They were all obscure. A Sicilian red caught my attention. She didn't know what grape it was, but was able to consult some written notes she had. Turned out it was a blend of three. To her credit, she did know it was a lighter red. We ordered it. Decent wine, shame it was so warm. Well into the 20s by my estimate. At $90/bottle+ tax and tip, I expect better. 

Oh yeah, the food was out in what seemed like two minutes, and we were still waiting on the wine!

Time to move on."}
{"text":"Great food - lots of gluten free pasta options.

Went here spur of the moment with a couple of friends on a Friday night. Busy, had to wait about 15 minutes but we got a spot at their stellar bar by the entrance for a quick drink while we waited. Awesome food, definitely a little pricey but worth it if you are up for a big night. Would recommend calling ahead for reso's!"}
{"text":"A decent place for Italian food in the core. Also one of the better ones in the area. Prices are quite reasonable considering the quality of the dishes and the location. 
I'd say the food is above average but definitely good value for what you're paying."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here before and it was great but having dinner here a week ago was definitely an experience!

Thumbs up to the attentive service with a dash of comedy from our waiter who was also knowledgeable on the wine selection right down to the ingredients in the dishes.

It was fairly busy inside so we were sat outside on the patio which actually was a bit nicer since it wasn't as loud as inside. Aside from the waste truck that came by it was a good time out there.

Food was incredible. If you like Italian food then you will not be disappointed. Everything is very traditional and is prepared with incredible detail. You could order almost anything off the menu and be impressed. The sauces are light and flavorful and nothing is overpowering. We had the Gelato for desert and were very impressed. Apparently they brought in a special machine from Italy and from the amazing taste of the Gelato...it's definitely authentic!

While a bit on the pricey side you definitely get what you pay for from the exceptional food to the great atmosphere. If you're looking for a great Italian dining experience downtown and outside of the College St area then this is it!"}
{"text":"Always like the food here, have been here several times. It's also very reasonably priced. They lost a reservation on my birthday, but management was very responsive from a customer service point of view. I'll be back."}
{"text":"In the past I have had good food and enjoyed myself at Terroni.  However in the last couple years, the place has gone totally downhill and certainly not worth the money you pay for dinner.  

I will never return after my experience at their Queen St. West location.  The food was adequate at best and the service was extremely slow (almost an hour after our order) and at some points down right rude.  When my food arrived it was barely warm.  To top it off they added a 17.5% gratuity charge for groups of 6 or more!  So be mindful of this before you choose to eat there.  Six is not a large group - most restaurants in Toronto have a set gratuity for 8, 10, or 12 guests.  6 is ridiculous and arrogant in my opinion. 

When we complained to the manager saying that we want to be able to tip what we felt was appropriate he was rather terse indicating it was restaurant policy.  

There are far better places in Toronto to eat Italian food in terms of both service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Lovely patio and nice drinks and pasta. Our waitress was pretty clueless and we had to prompt her for everything. They she brought us someone else's doggie bag."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Pretty darn close to what you'll find in Italy. We ordered the fried calamari which was simple, yet delicious. We ordered the pappardelle special which came with a beef ragu sauce and house made pasta. The pasta was authentic and fresh. The sauces were minimalistic in contribution to the dish therefore allowing the flavors of the other complementary ingredients to share the spotlight. Delicious!

Love the fact the prices are reasonable.

Extra information:

*Used to be a court
*Has Bar/Lounge area
*Extensive wine list 

There is a bar to the left side and a sandwich bar to the right when you walk into the restaurant. This restaurant gets really busy during lunch time but there are lots of staff to keep up with the crowd

Restaurant is huge inside. This location used to be a court so it's very roomy with high ceilings (this is what makes the restaurant SUPER noisy). Very nice authentic wooden tables and chairs around the restaurant gives it rustic italian home feel. This was taken 5 minutes before lunch crowd filled up the restaurant.

Complimentary BREAD & OLIVE OIL - The bread was soft and fresh and it's only served with olive oil. Apparently when you ask for Balsamic vinegar they don't give it to you because they use good quality olive oil and when you add balsamic vinegar to it, it ruins the taste. I get that the olive oil is good quality but I always like it better with some balsamic vinegar or salt and pepper.

Ordered: PARPELLINI ALLO IOSA - This is flat and wide pasta made fresh in the house. This comes with lots of ground sausage and it tastes better more you eat it. This pasta was very rich and the all the mild flavors went very good together.

Ordered: PARPELLINI WITH BOAR MEAT - This is same flat and wide pasta as above. I couldn't really taste the difference in boar meat but this was a little more tomatoey in sauce. I really enjoyed this dish. 

Ordered: SPAGHETTINI WITH MEAT SAUCE - Pasta was al Dente and I really like my pasta to be chewy. This is not your regular spaghetti- it's thicker and square shaped. Meat sauce was meaty and thick and it really went well with the pasta. There was lots of meat sauce left over and you can dip bread in it after.

Ordered: SPAGHETTINI WITH SEAFOOD - This had lots of fresh seafood and very light tomato based sauce. Tomato sauce was very tangy and a little too watery for me. I personally didn't really like this.

Ordered: AFFOGATO ALLA CREMA - It is a little pricey for $6 because it's kind of small but this was so good. They poured chocolate on top of the icecream and everything went very well together. Although I never drink espresso but this was really refreshing and the espresso was not bitter at all.

SUMMARY: Half way through our meal, the restaurant filled up fast and it got super noisy in the restaurant. We had to shout to hear each other and I blame this on the high ceiling. The service is very quick but don't expect a smile. Also, apparently they don't alter items on menu due to the fact that it's a set recipe so many dishes may not work for vegetarians or if you hate or is allergic to something. Overall I really liked this restaurant and would go back if I was craving pasta.

{"text":"What is there to say that hasn't already been said about this place? Expect to wait about 30 minutes for a table; the space is small and loud so conversation might be difficult. But the food. Oh, the food. So, so good. The beef carpaccio is divine. For the entree, I had the ravioli stuffed with duck confit -- by far some of the best ravioli I've ever tasted. It looked like everyone was ordering the pizzas so I think I'll try that the next time I'm back. Prices are a little higher than at other, comparable restaurants in Toronto, but the food is beyond compare. Go and try it now."}
{"text":"Terroni's never disappoints me. Te food is authentic and very good. I like that the serving staff doesn't turn over a lot. I like recognizing staff. Makes me think they are a good company to work for."}
{"text":"Wandering down Queen West, I went for an early dinner with one of my closest friends. We arrived and were seated with no wait just before six on a Thursday night. 

We checked out the fully extensive menu and decided to share a pasta dish and a pizza. For our pasta it was the Cavatelli al Sugo D'Agnello (17.95 handmade cavatelli, slow cooked lamb tomato sauce, pecorino) a small, nicely al dente pasta served with a tomato sauce with super tender lamb. Really tasty, though we agreed that we probably would have gotten tired of the pasta had we been eating a whole dish of it.  

For our pizza, we chose the  Santo Stefano (17.95, tomato, mozzarella di bufala, fresh arugola, prosciutto di parma.) The pizza was great. I get that they don't cut the pizza put with the arugula and the prosciutto it would have been so helpful, we were sawing away. It was super tasty.

Service was good - maybe too good. I would have hoped our food would have come out in courses, but in retrospect I didn't make that completely clear. Our food came out after only a few minutes - we ate our pasta first which meant the pizza was a little cold by the time we got it. 

All in all, a tasty dinner, but with the prices we were paying I would have hoped for a better paced meal. As we headed out the door I could imagine why we were in and out in under an hour, by a quarter to seven the lineup was out the door."}
{"text":"We were a group of 3 and went to Terroni because I had an extraordinary previous experience in another Terroni a couple of weeks ago. But the only good thing about our experience at the Adelaide location was the food. We didn't felt welcome, our server was always in a hurry, seaming to rush us to leave, never smiled and at the end, he came at least 4 times just to see if he could finally take the dishes out!"}
{"text":"Was there earlier today with some friends. A few ordered the gnocchi, another the ravioli, and one the Margherita pizza. The gnocchi was delicious; soft and with a simple flavourful tomato sauce and ricotta cheese. It was a warm delicious bowl that was perfect for the fall weather. The pizza was good as well though not stand out. I didn't try the ravioli but heard it was delicious. Service was good, adapted to a group of younger than average customers, and the atmosphere was welcoming and interesting.  Only one thing was less than amazing, and it was the music which seemed an odd mix of 80s and soft rock."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Terronis location by far.  Great service and ambience.  The seating isn't as squished compare to other locations, as long as you ask for a booth.  The music isn't blasted compared to the Adelaide location, where you can barely have a conversation without yelling at one another.  The servers here at much more attentive too!

My hubby and I's go to dish is always the bolognese and breaded mushroom salad.  Never disappoints!  And if it is the weekend he always has to have the bumba with nutella for dessert.  I find the bumba filling at times can be to lemony for my liking, but sometimes it is perfect.  It's a hit and miss for me.

I once tried the spaghetti alla limone at the Adelaide location as a recommendation by the server and I thought it was awful!  All I tasted was lemon and nothing else.

If you can handle spice, I suggest you ask for the chilli peppers to have with your bread before you start your meal.  I absolutely love this!"}
{"text":"My second time at Terroni. Still how I remembered it, food was very tasty and flavorful. I had the Funghi Assoluti as the app, recommended by my friend. The mushroom and oyster was very crispy, the balsamic vinaigrette really helped with the salad. My main was the Truffle pasta, yum :) topped it with the brownie dessert with two scoops of ice cream. The ice cream tasted a little off, not sure what flavor it was but it was still a great dessert.

It's a very great atmosphere catching up with friends with a drink. it's a darker lighting so if you don't like that, not for you. Overall, the drinks and food are very flavorful, a tad on the expensive end but worth a try or for those occasional gatherings or even on a date. I would go again some day."}
{"text":"People are up in arms about Terroni. Some people love it, some people hate it. To add a little more controversy to the mix, I really liked it. Wild, eh? 

I went on a Tuesday night and it was preposterously busy. The bar was taken up and people were standing around the foyer with nowhere to go. It was not a 20 minute wait like hostess said, more like double but we were still waiting on half our party so it was no trouble. The time came and unfortunately we were seated in a front booth, basically right beside all the standers. I would've preferred somewhere else because it is a very nice and opulent space, inside and out, so I would have liked to see more of it. 

Our waitress was chipper, teetering on the crazy side but that's ok because she knew her stuff. Side note: props to all the busboys! They do all the dirty work and are amazing. 

For an appetizer we got the cheese and meat plate/board. It had a very artisan feel to it and from seeing the man at the front crank out so many, I knew we had to have one. The portions of each component were a little bit small but it was all the bomb- especially some sort of poached pair that went great with everything. I was like a mad scientist with this one, mixing up all sorts of different combos. 

For my main I had the duck confit ravioli. It was mentioned that there was butternut squash and fig up in there but they never really came through. Sautéed porcini mushrooms were a lovely addition, as was the simple sauce that let the fresh pasta shine. It left me feeling satisfied but I couldn't resist a bit of rigatoni with zucchini, etc. in a tomato sauce- also very nice. 

Dessert was something else! Out of this world for me. Panna cotta is something I always see on the Food Network, know I would like and could not wait to try. So you could imagine my delight when I saw it on the menu. Now it was my first time trying the dish so I might not be a fair judge, but I found it to be excellent. It had a great consistency, milky white gorgeous, cute presentation with tang on the top from segmented oranges, raspberries, blueberries and grenadine. I don't know who is taking the time to half the blueberries or who is enjoying the dessert more this way but I guess that is their business. 

Ah I'm caught in the middle, 3.5 stars? Is that ok? No, I must commit and give in to the power of panna cotta. 4 stars and I'm coming back for pizza."}
{"text":"Middling Italian food which just isn't worth it when this city has so many fantastic Italian spots. Most dishes I've tried lack flavour and are unsatisfying. What really makes this place a thumbs-down is the consistently awful service- the servers have more attitude than any restaurant I've ever been to, and also just deliver poor quality service. There are much better places to spend your money and time."}
{"text":"I was visiting from San Francisco and a group of my friends decided to have a get together at Terroni. We were a party of 10 and was seated in one of the semi-private rooms on the side of the restaurant. First impression was terrific decor and ambiance plus great Italian food and company! 

The reason for the poor rating is because our server, Kate, had literally ruined our entire dining experience. She completely turned our experience to hell in the last hour of our time there. In the beginning she had gotten our orders mixed up which we were willing to forgive because it happens and we are generally a very relaxed group. After we ordered dessert was when her lack of professionalism shined its brightest. Our dessert took a good 45 mins to come but we ordered coffee, gelato and creme brûlée. When our dessert finally started to sprinkle in, everything was mixed up and a few items were missing. She had admit to the kitchen messing up on one girl's dessert so she needed to wait even longer to get hers. While handing us the desserts she repeatedly said to us \"I don't know what each of you ordered because you guys keep changing seats!\" EXCEPT we all stayed in our seats when we ordered and when the food was delivered. She really meant it because when our split bills came it was all wrong. She offered to change the 2 bills that was over/under charging us but still it was wrong. What prompt me to write this review is because she was basically half yelling and blaming us at the end of the night for her inability to service our party of 10! She claims she is doing her best but sorry honey at 18% gratuity, your current \"best\" is not suffice. Gratuity is for service. No attitudes please!

Dinner started at 7pm and ended at 10:30pm. What service?"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere.
Great service at a beautiful restaurant. 
Will always recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Teroni is the perfect example of how to scale a business but how not to. 

This is a really busy , loud, complicated place, theres so much people running around it takes away the feeling going to the restaurant should give you. Its suppose to be some kind of reward, a treat, something you do for yourself to enjoy and laugh and eat good food. Teroni dont create this ambiance, it feels like im a number, and thoses numbers need to come in and come out, fast. Its a machine not an art anymore, and thats where franchises and growing companies lose the magic. 

The food is really good, great pizza, great appetizer, higher than average skilled chefs. All the plates are cooked very well, and flavours are smartly arranged.

But its not enjoyable to be in teroni eating that delicious food. Its just run effectively on a business point of view, but very badly for a customer sitting down trying to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Price quite high for the amount of food, customer service so-so, quality of food decent.

I went for dinner to this venue with several co-workers. I found that the appetizers were quite nice and plentiful, yet the main course that I ordered (and seemed to be the case for the ones my co-workers ordered as well) was very pricey for a tiny dish. I ended up stopping over at a fast-food joint on my way home, as I was starving after my $33 meal there.

They asked us before starting our meal if we wanted water, and then whether we wanted flat water or soda water. One of the 3 of us who had arrived at that point asked for soda water, and they served us all a bottle of soda water without confirming that the rest of us agreed. Later I realized that there was a charge for a soda water, which was split between everyone at the table (I was asked if I wanted a second one, and I said yes, so again they split the bill for that part based on 2 out of a total of 5 people at the table, which I found odd).

Speaking of the water, the server initially refilled our glasses with the bottle she left on the table, but eventually the refill stopped happening, so after waiting a while, we ended up refilling our own glasses.

Based on my experience, I don't see me returning to this venue, mostly based on the fact that the value for the money was not there at all for me."}
{"text":"Came here with a huge group of probably 10 people or so and was thoroughly unimpressed by the meal.

The restaurant itself is quite unique--apparently it's an old courthouse and the last place someone got hanged in Toronto, and the bathrooms were where the gallows used to be. Maybe my boyfriend's lying to his poor, gullible, American girlfriend, but I really liked the history behind the restaurant!

I ordered a couple of whiskey sours throughout the night, my boyfriend a beer. It took awhile to get our drinks. It was fairly busy that night, but my boyfriend did have to remind our waitress a couple of times about the beer. Staff was very friendly though.

In terms of food, I ordered the gnocchi (CAD17) and my boyfriend ordered the Santo Stefano pizza (CAD19). These prices are fairly steep, especially for the pizza. The gnocchi was okay--it was nothing too memorable. It wasn't melt-in-my-mouth delicious, which is what I typically expect from a good gnocchi dish. The pizza was fairly sized, but also just rather average. There was a lot of argula on the pizza, which made the texture too leafy and smothered the taste of the prosciutto.

The meal ended up being fairly pricey with the drinks and I've definitely had much better Italian food elsewhere. Probably would not come back, even though the ambiance is lovely."}
{"text":"Huge Disappointment.  I had been to Terroni on Yonge St and I always had a good time.  However, we went to Terroni at Adelaide St on Friday night and the service at this location was poor at best. We ordered a bottle of wine, appetizers and entries. However, after a while we received the appetizers with no sign of the wine we had ordered. I mean, this is Restaurant Business 101!!  We kindly told them that we wanted the wine first and then we got the wine and still, there was the lady with the appetizer lining up to staffing the appetizers into out throats. Give me a break, I am trying to have a good time with my husband on the only night we go out in the month!  We finally made it through dinner, but Terroni at Adelaide St is not  at a place we want to go back.  I mean, at least someone can come out to apologize!  Even a small gesture such as a dessert and a proper apology would have made the difference. Again, take care of  customer service, because we also noted the servers wondering around looking for the customers who had ordered what they were given from the kitchen. Very unusual for Terroni standards."}
{"text":"Initially had a tried making a reservation at Mangia e Bevi and couldn't get one on a Friday night so our group opted for Terroni's.

Wasn't my first choice as I've been to their other location at Yonge/Adelaide and wasn't overly impressed.

This place definitely is much more spacious offering three floors and a patio. Initial impression not the friendliest of greetings when entering- cold and matter of fact.

Seated on the second floor the decor of the restaurant is gorgeous offering a modern take with great mood lighting. Our table was waiting for one person so we started with drinks and an appetizer. 

Pane, Olive e Taralli- bread, olives and handmade taralli- $4.95
Served in four separate small dishes the portions were a lot smaller than expected. The bread was mediocre, no balsamic vinegar, and the olives- green and black with red peppers were tasty especially the black ones as typically I find they lack flavour, not these ones.

Our table ordered pizzas and Tagliatelle alla Bolognese- everyone was happy with their dish. Be warned- no substitutions are permitted. Although a simple request was made to switch the black olives to green we were told it was not possible.

I ordered the San Giorgio- tomato, mozzarella, hot calabrese salame, fresh mushrooms- $16.95

Good flavour, thin crust and the calabrese had a definite kick to it. The crust itself was a little harder than I like it. Decent pizza but I have tried better.

Our server was pleasant but did not check in with us until later in the evening. Water was not replenished until the check was brought to our table. We asked for separate bills and were told we couldn't do that. 

I would come back once it's warm enough for patio seating or if in the area. If your going to try Terroni's visit this location."}
{"text":"Food wise they a great restaurant,  however customer service wise they getting today 1 star.

Had called on Monday to book a reservation for a bday party of 12 ppl. Been told that I got the reservation and a manager will call back within 24h to confirm. 72h later after no calls I decided to call and apparently I never called, never booked and all together they don't take reservation on the date / time that I have requested based on what the girl on the phone told me...  one would think he is crazy but thank God I got all my conversations recorded, with that said the manager had to step in the picture.  Instead of apologizing for the mistake and taking my business I got offered a ridiculous offer (that they knew I would decline) that if I want to reserve with them I have to spend a minimum of 2k on that dinner. No offence but Terroni is not in the league of high end restaurant to make such conditions. Which I called next to Harbour60 and got the reservation for the party without a problem without any conditions. 

Very shameful by the stuff of Terroni, I would definitely stop all my business meetings and future dinner events to this restaurant but instead would give it better to someone that would appreciate my business and all the money that I would spending there."}
{"text":"Decent food, not so decent service. While the duck ravioli was to die for, I could've lived without the unpleasant waitress and hard bread."}
{"text":"I was a bit underwhelmed by terroni. But this might have been because it was so overhyped by a friend of mine, and I can see why! 
I had an okay experience there. Great venue, although the art on the wall was very questionable, as well as the prison like structure of the place, which you'll notice more if you go down towards the restroom. 
But the food wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't top notch either. I wouldn't make it my go to for high quality Italian, but nonetheless it's a cool spot to meet up and have dinner."}
{"text":"We went to Terroni for the second time last night and were surprised to find that there were only certain dishes allowed Fresh ground  Parmesan. My husband's dish which contained seafood and my pizza were NOT on the list of approved Parmesan dishes. When we asked for it, we were politely refused even though 2 other people at our table received the elusive Parmesan. At first we thought our waiter was joking when he refused to put it on ours. Then I asked if I could PAY extra for the Parmesan - no! - instead were offered the opportunity to order a different dish - one which was allowed to receive Parmesan but we could not under any circumstance have it on the dishes we ordered. Wow really? The customer is not always right in this case obviously. If this were a restaurant of a higher caliber with a chef that was known and trusted then I would defer to that chef's ingredient choices but maybe not. Who cares what I choose to have on my food? This is a mere middle of the road Italian restaurant and we were shocked at the arrogance. Too many other places in this awesome city that will be taking our restaurant money from now on."}
{"text":"Best pizza you could possibly have in downtown Toronto, lots of room for paid parking, friendly staff and you will definitely love the decor. It's always best to call ahead because the place is always busy however they will do their best to get you a table. I have gone here about 5 times already (Yes I have no life). Overall great for dates, with groups and bdays!"}
{"text":"I have never been to this location and instantly loved the atmosphere and the decor. 
I was there on a Saturday night so it was packed.

It was very close seating with your neighbors...I think at one point I had a gorgeous blonde sitting on my lap trying to wrestle into her seat. 

However the service was good and the food was amazing. I had the fried calamari which was presented in a cool paper roll which felt like it would never end. My main course was simple and super tasty. 

The only thing I didn't like is that I over ate and wanted to fall asleep after dinner. 

I give this place 4 stars not just because the food but the atmosphere of the venue and the energy."}
{"text":"The food was good but the desserts are even better ! The staff is friendly and it gets very busy here."}
{"text":"High Priced for Low Quality

This was a very disappointing dining experience. We came to Terroni on Adelaide with a large group for a birthday, service was fine - a bit slow but understand that she was serving a group of 22.
I started my meal off the with Assorted Bruschetta - this was horrible. There were 3 versions of Bruschetta - all of which were tasteless and served on burnt toast.
For my main I had the Tonnarelli alla Norcina ($26 pasta) - the overall taste of this dish was okay, however - there are some major concerns with an Italian restaurant serving store bought pasta - understanding the cost of this dish stems from the \"fresh\" truffle shavings which had zero flavour and adding no value to this meal. 

Based on my first two items, I didn't even humor myself with the thought of dessert. 

Overall, I am disappointed to say I spent close to a $100 last night on a meal that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. There are tons of Italian restaurants in Toronto that are serving authentic Italian food, Terroni is not one of them."}
{"text":"Service was ok and as well as the food.  Did we have a good experience ? Not really.  While def not mind paying $$ for good food and good service this was not the case. 
We just heard lots of no no no 
Our server told us that they dont offer bread so suggested us to order some special \" Burrata\" as bread and so we did without looking at price. 
Its was 21$ for 4 small pieces of bread, cherry tomatos, basils and 1 ball of white cheese - really??
Then when I ordered diet coke-  I was told \"sorry we dont serve any diet pop\"
Then when ordering for the pasta canne di mare \"sorry we do not offer parmigiano cheese on top\" just as an warning -huh?
Then after ordering desserts \" sorry sold out \"
The whole exp was weird and my partner is Italian from Rome also felt the same way so it's not just us the non italians:)
For 4 people close to $300, I think I will find somewhere else next time to enjoy our dinner."}
{"text":"Went with 4 adults and no one was happy. We all ordered appetizers and 3 people had pizza and one had halibut ($32) which was SMALL FOR THE PRICE and the purée potatoes were almost non existent against the white plate. This place had NO balsamic vinegar in the restaurant for the caprese salad.  No one comes by with a pepper grinder unless you ask each time they bring a dish. The service is not upscale yet the location and decor are beautiful. The 3 pizzas which were ordered are not cut and it states that  on the menu. LAZY LAZY!!! You have to fight with the steak knife to get it cut. Many pizza dishes were flying by uneaten from other customers so the cutting might have been an issue but also the pizzas were tasteless since there are no spices just basic plain tomatoes sauce. Basic boring sauce. PIZZAS WITH OLIVES HAVE PITS and they were clumped together. Everyone found the 3 pizzas boring no taste, uncut. Best part of the meal were the desserts!!! Over priced, basic Olive Garden service, No Changes were another issue, my husband wanted anchovies added, no changes. This place is so basic that if it wasnt for the decor they would not have such a crowd!!! Atmosphere 10, food 1."}
{"text":"Terroni's is Italian food done right.  I dropped by for lunch with a friend this past Saturday and our lunch exceeded expectations.

To start - we both shared their beef carpacio (sp?) salad.  I have never tried beef carpacio before it was a fabulous.  The beef was rare and thinly sliced seasoned with olive oil, salt and pepper.  It was topped with an argula salad with shavings of asigo cheese.  The combination of all the flavours just worked.  The beef just melted in your mouth.  I would order this again in a heart beat.

For our entree, we shared a pizza - we got the St Nicolas, toppings were prosciutto, argula and dolops of cheese (I forget what kinda).  The pizza was devine, it was the right thickness and great balance of all the ingredients.

Service was great.  Their staff is very attentive to your needs.  It was a good pace between courses.

Terroni's is one of favourites places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Cosimo Mammoliti brought a creditable first to Toronto with South Italian cuisine and warmth, and the Terroni still charms. There are some real hits that can make a memorable experience. But my close friends seem to agree you can also expect some real misses, and a few good misfires can definitely bring down a whole meal - or make them abandon for good the place they used to really love.

A recent Adelaide location meal consisted of two decent but extremely lightweight pizzas, and the kid in tow had an unbelievably expensive plain tomato spaghetti that - they say housemade pasta? - was so hard it was almost gritty, like undercooked dry Catelli. He barely touched it.
Overall a bit too expensive for a casual family meal so while not a total bomb it was moderately disappointing to bring my out-of-town family here for lunch. Would rather have gone to Vi Vehta for a little more substance and value before putting my friends back on the long road. Barely a 3 today, and Terroni has been a 4 or 5.

Desserts were very good recently. Google some newer reviews as menu items seem to come and go, to some chagrin."}
{"text":"Toronto meets LA in this hip fashionable three story restaurant complete with roof top dining.

We were graced with probably one of the best tables on the patio. Great views and gentle breeze. Our Welsh ancestors were smiling on us when we got this table.

The other patrons were all beautiful hip nicely dressed and loud. Fun to watch.

Our party of four raised the average age by a good 5 years. But we were made very welcome and had a delightful evening.

Our  wine hostess Nebilah was excellent and taking her sommelier exam next week. She'll pass with flying colors. A photo of the wine the others drank is attached.

I drank a delicious sour drink that had an almond type liqueur in it.

Now the food. We started with Brushetta, and calamari. Very nice and predictable. Good portions and tasty.

For mains we had a prosciutto pizza, ravioli, bolognese, and a beet salad. We all enjoyed our meals, were full and satisfied afterward.

We skipped coffee and desert and headed home about 10.

We were a happy group of diners.

Cost was as anticipated, not quit LA expensive.

We are going to the downtown LA location tonight ( Dec 5 2015)"}
{"text":"How can you not love about this restaurant which is a converted old court house? The restaurant has stories itself. I love the interior. The food was also amazing, I love the calamari salad and the truffle pasta. Fantastic! I would love to visit every week if I live in Toronto."}
{"text":"I found this place pretty uptight and stuck up for a simple pizza/pasta restaurant. The waiter we had was extremely rude and pompous. Also, I really did not like that this place doesn't do substitutions, if I'm paying like $20 for a medium sized pizza I expect to get the toppings I like. When my friend asked for an extra ingredient to be added to her pizza, the waiter rudely stated there's no substitutions and moved on to the next person. Honestly, the high-and-mighty attitude of this place and the poor quality of food and atmosphere deters me from ever coming back."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the food here. Oyster mushroom salad is one of my favourites. One thing they won't serve you balsamic with your bread. They have a wonderful olive oil and they want you to enjoy the pure flavour. I could just drink it in its own. I haven't had anything here I didn't like"}
{"text":"An old favorite revisited...It's been WAY too long.  
Since Libretto appeared on the scene, it has boldly battled it's way to pizza superstardom.  But don't forget about Terroni's. This Southern Italian eatery is still standing strong.

Terroni's is all about tradition.  The restaurant is buzzing with activity with a lineup out the door.  You can imagine old Italian men gathering here.  The place is wonderfully decorated, dim lit and cozy (cozy, because there are so many tables and people crammed together).
 
The menu has wonderful pastas, but I go right to the pizza menu with about 30 pizzas to choose from.  I think their most creative pizza is the C'T Mang.  It's a white pizza with mozzarella, gorgonzola, fresh pears, walnuts, smoked prosciutto, and honey. It's awesome!

Almost more popular than the pizza was the flour-less chocolate cake.  Oozing dark chocolate, it's any chocolate lovers dream.  If they weren't like 8 bucks a pop, I'd eat three of them.

Service may not be as spectacular, but the waitstaff know their stuff, giving excellent wine recommendations with your meal.
No dipping olive oil. :(
No Substitutions (If you uber picky or have allergies)
Crappiest cutlery on the planet.  A disposable plastic knife would have done me better. I gave up and ate with my hands.

So, Teronni's is a great place for a real Italian meal with a real Italian vibe.  I always enjoy my meal here.  But depending on your scene, you may prefer the hip and trendy Libretto."}
{"text":"Delightful and always consistent. Food is delicious, restaurant is beautiful (the patio in the summer is key), staff are attentive. They only source and feature Italian wines so that can be limiting if you don't love them."}
{"text":"Good service, comfortable environment, authentic Italian fare.

I come here for their pizzas mostly - it's the thin crust that are especially commendable. and their ingredients are always fresh, hearty and flavorful. Pastas are of good standard as well but a bit on the small side. Their tomato-based sauces, made from San Marzano D.O.P. (from that region) tomatoes, are prime.

for dessert, order their oh-so-smooth, soaring-fat-content homemade gelato. i recommend the hazelnut one which is deeply, well, hazelnut-ty."}
{"text":"Two friends and I went to the Rosedale Terroni for brunch today.  Good news?  The food was quite good, and the restaurant was not as noisy as it can sometimes be.

Unfortunately, we received the worst service I can ever recall being subjected to in a restaurant.  Our server actively ignored us and took us for granted.  The food took forever which we dealt with as we were having fun catching up, but the lack of interest on the part of our server caused all three of us to resolve never to return.  A pity."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our Toronto favorites.
We went last night for our grandsons first birthday.

No complaints about the seating or the service however this USED to be great place to go for pizza and past.

Last night we had the grilled calamari ( not very fresh), the fried calamari ( inedible they took it off the menu) one white pizza (tasteless and lukewarm), 2 margarita pizzas both bland skimpy on cheese and lukewarm and a tagliatelli bologonase which was cool, bland, boring and tasteless.

I dont know what happened to quality control but it sure was not evident last night.

Very disapointing as we flew in from Florida for the birthday"}
{"text":"Hmm... My feelings were mixed about this place.  I ordered the grilled calamari.  It was not seared properly and the dish was bland.  It was served with musclun greens, diced tomatoes and balsamic.  It was not up to par.  Then I had the gnocchi which someone said was yummy.  I personally though it was gross.  Heavy and off balance.  Pops, drinks, and even ice tea was expensive.  And I am the type that likes to order at least 2-4 drinks, but at their prices -  I don't think so.   But they have one item on there menu worth going to Terroni's for.  And that's their smoked salmon white pizza.  If you like smoked salmon order it. I would only go to Terroni's for pizza or just for dessert in the future; not a three course meal.  Decor beautiful - casual - romantic - hipster.  Location great.  But pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I recently tried Terroni for the first time ever for a friend's bday.  Believe the hype! I was quite impressed by the constant stream of people quickly filling any empty seats on a Thursday night.  Resos are strongly recommended.  On suggestion from a friend, I ordered the pappardelle alla ioso which is pappardelle noodles, spicy sausage, button & oyster mushrooms and green peas.  It was delicious! Though I didn't find it spicy at all. Service was a little slow and one of our servers completely forgot to bring me a drink.  He realized about 35 mins later when I was able to get his attention again and got me a drink on the house.  Overall a good 1st impression, beautiful space and a wonderful treat for your tastebuds."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for this place. First of all, the restaurant is beautiful in a large grand historical building. The menu has a great array of options - salads, pastas, pizzas, from the grill. Their pizza rivals Pizzeria Libretto - amazing crispy thin crust, very flavourful sauce. I tried 2 pasta dishes which were cooked perfectly and bursting with flavour. I would say that their wine is a little pricey. I just moved super close to this place - it is definitely going to become one of my regular dinner spots."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed eating here. We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed. After waiting in line (and squeezed tightly against the shelves of pasta and sauces for sale) for about twenty minutes, we got  a table. I wouldn't say this was the best table in the house but at least it was a table and it wasn't right next to the door. The service was fairly fast despite how busy it was. 

The ingredients used are simple and fresh. I had the gnocchi with a simple tomato sauce. My one criticism is that I always find that every time I order this dish, it usually comes with just one fresh basil leaf. It tastes so good with basil! Give me more! I try to cut the single leaf into little pieces just so that I can enjoy the taste with several bites, rather than with just two bites. Though the gnocchi was good, I think I would have been more excited about the ravioli. My main was a standard meal. My boyfriend got the fettucine and loved it. He was also immensely pleased by the fact that her ordered a negroni to drink and it came perfectly mixed. 

Definitely a place I would go back to when I get the craving for Italian food. The prices are also fairly reasonable, considering the popularity of this spot and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, nothing special. The staff wasn't really nice. The prices are too expensive for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I am only giving it 3 stars because there are no vegan options. (rightfully so - chefs choice). the atmosphere is great but if you are vegan the only thing you can have is the spinach salad. I recommend the queen street west location for a more intimate feel.  They also do take-out."}
{"text":"This is a great Terroni. Wish they were open Sunday. If they were, I'd give them an extra star."}
{"text":"This is a fancy Italian restaurant serving southern Italian food in a more authenticate style.  Food  was nice, served hot, freshly made and made well.  The building is an old court house with holding cells in the basement and what was the gallows is now a dinning area.  So you can say people have been hanging around here for a long time.
We came for my daughter 23 birthday and she enjoyed it.  Not my thing though.  Too sophisticated a menu for me. So if you a foodie and want fancy,  this is a good place to try."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of pizza so based on the wait and line up outside Terroni I could only imagine how great this place would be.   The only other time I've had to wait was at Lombardi's (New York), Lou Malnati's (Chicago), and Zacharys/Cheese Board (SF-Bay).    After a 15-20 min wait which wasn't too bad, I was ready for some pizza.   Seating by the door as people watch you eat, not appealing at all and if I you get the opportunity don't get a booth by the entrance.    The menu has a huge variety of pizzas ranging  between $15-20 a personal pizza.    The pizzas didn't take long to arrive and they looked delicious.   It definitely reminded me of classic New York style with the guey cheese and thin crispy crust.    BTW I'm a born bred New Yorker so I was hoping for something to remind me of my hometown pizza.   While the pizza was good, it wasn't a wow, the flavors were bland and there was a lack of sauce to give it that punch in flavor.      As a New Yorker, I was disappointed.  Having paid $20 for a pizza which I could have gotten for $5 in NYC, all I got from this place was a dent in my wallet.     However, the good note is that it is one of the better places for pizza in Toronto.   

Lastly, service could be so much better!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal as per usual! The funghi, pizza, pasta were spectacular!! So consistent every single time, after all these years.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked through the door was the lovely and inviting scent of olives and fresh baked bread. That was a very good sign, as it was the first time I had ever been there.

The food was good. To the point where I felt like going back the very next day lol. 

I had the grilled calamari and salad to start, which I shared. My main course was spaghetti and tomoto sauce. We also shared a pizza which I also liked. 

Being from Montreal, it is difficult for me to like other pizzas,  because we have a completely different style (Montreal Style Pizza) but I would come back here for a pizza fix!

Overall it was a good experience and I would come back."}
{"text":"absolutely loved this place! Came here with a group of friends and everything was made to perfection. My fiancé got the natalina pizza and the cured meat was spicy and delicious. I also had tonnnarelli Alla norcina pasta with spicy sausage, shaved truffles and pecorino - simple yet delicious. Would also recommend this place for groups, staff was very accommodating, nice and friendly! Decor is charming and has a rustic Italian feel. Definitely a top Italian pick in Toronto!"}
{"text":"One of the most beautiful restaurant I went to in Toronto. I heard that it's in an old court, so it's pretty impressive when you enter into the venue.

As for the food, it was very good, and tasty. I got some calamari as an appetizer, and a signature pizza as the main course. Those were very good. The choice of beers was not bad at all. The only thing is that they don't have any diet soft drinks, it's a bit weird.

I would have given a solid 4 stars if it wasn't from the service: it was so slow. We were at the lunch time, but is it not the reason to live of a restaurant? Just as an example, it took us about 10 minutes to be able to ask the waitress that we wanted to have the bill, and another 10 minutes to be able to pay it (and it's probably because we decided to get up to signify that we were tired of waiting!).

So great food, good ambiance (they had a DJ during lunch time), but a very slow service."}
{"text":"An Italian food lover and Toronto native recommended this place to us. He was raving about the Ravioli di zio Paperone (stuffed with duck confit).  He was not wrong.  We devoured the dish.  In addition, we tried the Cavatelli al Sugo D'Agnello (braised lamb) which was yummy and had more substance than the ravioli.

We also ordered the Calamari alla griglia, a grilled calamari on a bed of vegetables. It was very refreshing compared to the usual fried ones. If you're looking for a healthier appetizer option, this is it.  We had room for dessert and ordered the Affogato and Budino, I enjoyed the Budino and my partner enjoyed the Affogato.

This place has a great atmosphere with multiple floors and plenty of seating. It was still packed when we arrived at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon.  

My negatives are the portions and service.  The portions aren't very big so you could spend a good amount to get full.  The service was subpar, our waitress was pretty nonchalant during our entire meal and didn't really check in. We had to ask multiple times for certain things."}
{"text":"Terroni is  a decent restaurant with consistently better than average food(just a little better not a lot).  The food is not good enough for the pretentious attitude though  It's always a laugh when a restaurant tries to dictate what a customer should like and what food goes with what.  If someone asks for grated cheese on a seafood pasta just give it to them.   My grandfather who has never set foot in Canada from Italy likes cheese on seafood pasta and has never been denied the request over there.  The only reason a place of business sets such rules is for efficiencies don't believe the BS about it being the proper way."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this over priced, upscale version of olive garden is the atmosphere. The wait staff were unfriendly, the service was slow, and the food was cold. I ordered the olive oil and garlic spaghetti and not only was it cold...but it was underdone... not el dente..  but just plain under cooked. My husband and friend shared a pizza which was ok...but going to dominos would've been just as good. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I have nothing to add to the 1-3 star reviews. I think Mona F. said it best, \"Terroni...get over yourself\"."}
{"text":"I love going to terroni for pizza and pasta. They have very good receipts, far better than Mercatto in my opinion. I like the seafood pasta, ravioli, the truffle pasta and the pizza with prosciutto, walnut ant pear."}
{"text":"Tried, tested, and true.  I have a lot of out of town guests, and I always want to take them somewhere interesting, lively, and reliably good.  I generally end up at Terroni on Adelaide partially for the decor, and partially for the food.

I love the crowd mix & the fact that it's hip but families still come to eat in this lively atmosphere.  Usually there is an IPOD DJ on the weekends, so it's a good spot if you don't want to talk too much!

If you are a picky substitution eater, please do not go here.  Terroni's is very protective about their recipes - and I personally have no issues with it.  

Don't eat downstairs, the atmosphere is like a cellar - not the same.  I will wait longer to eat in the main room.

Funghi Salad is a must , and ask for the sommelier if you're not sure about what kind of wine you want to order.  I always ask for the sommelier and they always choose a great wine for me!"}
{"text":"Always love coming to this location but I have noticed the past two times I've come they have brung out the food before the drinks making the night seem rushed and out of order. I would suggest you mention to the waiter to make note to hold the food until after the drinks or simply keep saying you aren't ready to order until after the drinks come. Overall though meal and atmosphere a hit as per usual !"}
{"text":"When you go to Terroni, you expect authentic Italian food, but you also expect a good non-fussy dining experience.  The décor is simple, and the menu has some interesting items that you don't see at every other Italian place.

I had the duck confit ravioli, which was delicious, with the rich fatty duck meat coming through the simple sauce and parmesan cheese.

Patio is also nice and cool even on a hot summer day, and there is plenty of shade and space for you to stretch out."}
{"text":"Never. Coming. Back. Here.

Fairly rude server, and the food was kind of disgusting. I'm surprised because I've been eating here quite a number of times, and everything was fine.

The spaghetti recommended by someone as being great (seafood) was mushy, overcooked, disgusting. My friend's pizza looked worse than what you can get at Pizza Pizza, and my other friend ordered the confit ravioli which was swimming in oil.

Top that off with a disappointing appetizer of carpaccio, and we're out a lot of money, for a meal that left me hungry at the end.

Not coming back. I can't believe I used to like this restaurant. Going to Grazie Ristorante at Yonge & Eglinton instead. At least they know how to handle customer service there, for about the same price, and with better pasta."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with a beautiful back patio. I'm glad that we stumbled upon Terroni on a recent trip to Toronto. The cheese plate was delicious (and I don't even really like cheese). The servings are large-- we ordered the cheese app, pizza and some wine, and it was more than enough. Our server was fast and efficient, but it wouldn't hurt him to smile a bit."}
{"text":"As the 55th review for this popular pizza place, feel free to totally ignore it.

Quick overview;

We thought we would avoid a line up by arriving at 6:30 on a Saturday night.  We were wrong.  By 7:30 there was a bit of a lull, so that may be a better time to go.  Perhaps the early arrivers were going to a movie or something else the kids enjoy.

The \"gourmet\" pizza here IS very good.  My arugula, sun-dried tomato and some kind of fancy cheese version was delicious.  And this from a guy who prefers old-timey pizza.  See http://www.yelp.ca/list/pizza-toronto

The $3 Italian hot chocolate, served in an espresso glass, was the perfect dessert.  VERY chocolaty, with whipped cream on top.

And as a bonus, if the hugeness of the line-up turns you off, there are plenty of other options within a block or two."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for dinner today we ordered the  C't Mang which was delicious and peppino pizza was quite bland tasting. I have definitely had better pizza."}
{"text":"I am ambivalent towards the Terroni chains, as I really loved the now closed location at St. Clair (my usual lunch spot when I worked in the area), but didn't particulary like the Adelaide E. location. However, I really liked Bar Centrale/Terroni. The design is uber modern and cool, and it is so spacious. I was there for a birthday party and we had booked the entire upper floor (party room of sorts). 

Terroni's for me is all about hearty and meaty comfort Italian food, so I devoured my Tagliatelle alla Bolognese with its rich ragu sauce. Spectacular. I then shared a pizza with my bf with spicy, hot salame - decent, but I loved my pasta more. The menu is extensive with many choices for Primi Piatti (small pasta portions) which I love. If it didn't look so weird and if it didn't surpass my carb intake for the month, I would order 3 different Primi pasta dishes and take a mega sleep afterwards.

The wine selections contain deep, rich reds to accompany the hearty pasta dishes. I had two glasses of the Trentino, and the colour was an intense, aubergine purple. Just right with ragu. 

For dessert, I had the Crème Caramel which is a nice and light dessert. Some of my friends had the Tiramisu and everyone loved that one too.

In the end, this is a great Terroni addition, and I would prefer this location to the one on Adelaide. It's much, much bigger with several floors so it's able to accommodate many people. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is another example of an Italian place in the city that thinks its all that but really is just average at best, and very poor if you compare it to places in Italy.  Just have to shake your head when they bring you poorly made pasta and then tell you cant put any cheese on it. People who work there.... look around you , just in case you have not noticed you are not in Italy and if you were your restaurant would probably not last a week. 

Having said that, food is okay/average and would probably get another star if people there were not such snobs who I doubt can even point to Italy on a map."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Terroni, I haven't tried their Queen's Street location.

That said, I enjoyed it very much. I am normally very skeptical of Italian restaurants because it's always cheap stuff (pasta) that is overpriced with a bit of cream and flavouring.

We ordered the ostrich carpaccio that had black truffle slices (4 to be exact), and I loved the entire dish. I have never had raw ostrich, let alone ostrich and the flavour was so delicate and with a bit of a tang. Very unlike steak tartare, which I find a bit more mellow and sweet. The black truffle enhanced the flavours very nicely, and with a bit of lemon on top of some bread, it was a real hit for me, even at $14 ;P

Then we shared a sea bass which was cooked very nicely, with grilled vegetables (ick on the potatoes and whatever that tasteless white/yellowy onion-looking thing was), but the raddichio was nice, and the asparagus too little (I would have liked a whole heaping of grilled asparagus and no other veggie). It was flavourful and I was glad to see the entire fish had its head, eyeballs and all, and wasn't sanitized for my dining experience, although the people next to me eating their standard pastas turned a little green.

Another girl at our table ordered the wild boar tagliatelle which we took a bite of and liked. I love wild boar (ate it in the mountains in Portugal once), and although the lovely texture was masked because they shredded this particular boar, it still had a lovely flavour with the red wine and tomato sauce.

We finished with a dark chocolate torta which I liked, but had a feeling that they microwaved, even if it was delicious :) 

Overall, a good restaurant to go to. Great ambience, lovely high ceilings, wonderful architecture and lots of space! Reserve in advance for weekends and holidays.

I'll come back, and order the ostrich carpaccio for sure, and perhaps the duck confit ravioli next time.

I suggest you avoid the pizzas altogether. They look mediocre. Go for the pasta, which is what they're known for.

The only negative about the service (and I totally understand) is that they don't split bills. :( We had to try and figure out what everyone ordered with HST included, and it was a little hassle, but a small negative."}
{"text":"Food is ok but not really authentic , sorry but am picky when we speak of italian food , there is better choice out there for a better price."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant.   I was pleasantly surprised.   The food was delicious and service was great.  The only cons would be. ..no diet soda and no chicken product.   Other than that,  I would definitely recommend this place.   :)"}
{"text":"Everyone knows the pizza, so I won't comment, except to say, try the arugula!  ;-)

Two quick points...met a friend at noon on a Thursday, and the service was perfectly fine, and it was packed by 12:30.

Second point...this was the best caffe Americano I've ever had.  Maybe it was a \"long black\" (from wiki. \"The Long Black is an espresso shot pulled over hot water thus preserving the crema\").  Anyway, whatever it was, it consisted of about 5-6 oz of good coffee with crema intact.

I usually don't order Americanos, because I don't like espresso ruined by having hot water poured on top of it, but when I ordered coffee, the server asked \"Americano?\", and I didn't think I had a choice."}
{"text":"Terroni is always a safe bet for a dinner dining option. The quality of food is good, ambiance great, portions are pretty generous and prices reasonable.  The menu is pretty extensive from light fungi salads to pastas to pizzas to paninis to seafood and meaty mains there is always something for everyone to enjoy.  The wine list is relatively extensive though is limited to Italian wines (though there are only a handful of Wines offered by the glass).  This particular location is set in a beautiful historical courthouse building with interesting architecture, high ceilings, beautiful windows and separate dining spaces. Reservations are always recommended."}
{"text":"Food: 3-3.5/5.......need to get this out of the way, it's good, but not among the best Italian food in the city. 

So why 4stars?

This is one of the best wine bars in the city and easily the best Italian wine bar in the city. Prices and selection are superb, kind of stuff you might see in NYC.

Service & ambience:4/5

Repeat: Yes"}
{"text":"Enormous and delicious. As with everything good in life, some patience is a must as line ups are common here. But generally, once seated, it's a great experience. A good wine selection - although beware the RED BUBBLY! - to ensure that you can always find something to go with the great thin crust 'za. The pasta is generally underwhelming with delicious fresh made noodles covered in too-watery sauces and timid flavours, but the pizza is robust and hearty and usually what people are there for (along with the great ambience). I still like the Queen W location more, but with a palatial interior, there is a lot to be said for terroni on Adelaide."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, but every time was a great experience. This time around, I was here to celebrate a friend's birthday, and they had no problem setting a table for 20 people! When 4 of us arrived, there was a bit of a wait time to get seated; Although our table was ready, the hostess wanted more people to arrive. In the moment, I wasn't too perturbed, because I was just excited to be celebrating and having some fun.

Eventually, we were seated and I proceeded to order vino. My fave dish of all time is their Taglietelle Bolognese, which comes in a rich meat sauce. If you're hungry, than this will really hit the spot. There is also a huge mother of a Florentine Steak at $99 which my boyfriend and 2 other people share. All men and 3 of them finished the hunk of a meat in no time. 

We also ordered a variety of appetizers to share at the table, and of course, I ordered the Calabrese Pizza which comes with spicy meat. 

Overall, I enjoyed my time and the food really is good. Always busy, so reservations are definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Solid pasta place in Toronto - had a group dinner here a few months ago and everyone enjoyed their food. The outside area at the back of the restaurant is a great place to sit when it's warm."}
{"text":"Buyer beware...this was my second visit to this Terroni location. 

The food and atmosphere are fine however there are other better italian/pizza places in the area.

My 2 star rating comes from the bill.

As part of our meal, we ordered a half bottle of wine to share. When our bill arrived the price seemed a little high. On closer inspection we realized that although the description for our wine very specifically described the 1/2 bottle we had ordered, the price was that of the full bottle. We were given no apology from the server, or management.

When the error is in the computer system , it makes me wonder how many other tables that night overpaid for their food and/or wine unknowingly. I'm guessing at least a few. 

Pretty sketchy Terroni...we won't be back."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm writing this review rather late... since my visit occurred on August 31st and it is now officially November. However, this is probably in Terroni's favour since it has given me ample time to simmer down and somewhat forget how pissed off I was when I walked out their door....

It all started when a close friend recommended that we have a girl's night at Terroni's, apparently one of the \"best Italian restaurants in town.\" So the expectations were high. We had called to make a reservation for 10 at 8. 3 of us arrived right at 8 to claim our spot, and our table wasn't ready. That's relatively understandable for a very busy establishment on a Friday night, so we decided to grab some drinks from the bar. I opted for a ridiculously pricey Peach Bellini. It was good, but incredibly tiny/dainty for the price.

Soon after I ordered my drink, the hostess came over to let us know that our table for 2 was ready. Two? Um, it was a reservation for ten! TEN!! Like one-zero. And so, it was back to the bar to wait. I think we did finally get a table around 8:40.

Great, now I'm starving. So I ordered Frittura di Calamari (fried calamari) to start and Spaghetti Ca' Pummarola N'Goppa (spaghetti with basal and tomato sauce) as a main. 

Bread and olive oil was served to the table. The bread was good, but the olive oil, which is apparently specially made just for Terroni and imported from Italy was terrible. It was very heavy and extremely bitter, obviously an acquired taste. I asked the waiter if there was any balsamic vinegar available to go with the oil. No, they don't do balsamic at Terroni. What about any other, less potent, lighter oils. No, they only have their special Terroni blend, disgusting olive oil. Someone else at our table requested butter. Guess what? They don't do butter at Terroni. Okay, so bread is out!

My calamari arrived and it was exactly what it said it would be. Deep fried calamari served with a wedge of lemon. No tartar sauce or tomato sauce on the side. I requested a side of tomato sauce. Unfortunately, they don't do sides of tomato sauce at Terroni. At this point I was upset. I asked the waiter if there was ANYTHING they were going to do to make our visit to the restaurant enjoyable. Obviously shocked by my displeasure, he said he would see what he could find for me to go with my calamari, and returned with a small dish of chili oil. Oh yes, an obvious compliment to my calamari! (Not.)

Once my deep fried calamari that I had hardly touched had the opportunity to become stone cold, my spaghetti and TOMATO SAUCE arrive. Oh finally, something to dip my calamari in. Geez I was pissed. My pasta was okay, but at this point my visit was beyond ruined.

On the website, Terroni states:
\"Our menu is filled with regional Italian dishes that have been prepared the same way for generations.
\"So out of respect for our Italian gastronomy - and our grandparents - we maintain a no modifications, no substitutions policy.\"
And clearly, this is strictly adhered to. I would challenge this by saying, that your grandparents, like my grandparents, and my grandparents grandparents loved having company for dinner, and aimed to please. Unfortunately Terroni does not aim to please, and as is apparent, I left not pleased. It is still questionable as to whether or not I will ever go back and give them a second chance. Part of me wants to, but part of me want to tell them to buzz off and shove their pretentious attitude where the sun don't shine.

Our server was very nice, but the service over all was far too slow. It was really expensive... about $75 per person for a drink, an app, an entree and dessert."}
{"text":"The location on Queen St. is ok but this one seems to be far below par. We had a green salad which was fairly flavourless. The quality of the lettuce was above average but nothing as far as dressing and the tomatoes were tasteless and like cardboard. The salumi platter was ok. Too large a portion for two people. i wish they'd told us it was a board the size of half the table. The taste was ok, certainly nothing like the selections from some better italian grocers in town. The pasta was the real let down. Spaghetti with clams, scallops and squid was completely overcooked. The noodles were huge and the sauce was lame. The seafood tasted freezer burnt and permeated the sauce in a disgusting way. My gnocchi was lower quality than a freezer pack from Loblaws and the similar tomato sauce made it like bland baby food. After the larger than expected salumi, neither of us felt any reason to finish the pasta. Expensive and below frozen quality. Why do I keep using the word frozen? Because everything here tasted just like that. The opposite of how italian food should be."}
{"text":"I find this place to be really expensive but I understand why they're so great. It's just quality all over. They're pizza uses fresh dough, fresh mozzarella, fresh everything. The pasta I ordered used red wine and I wouldn't be surprised if the pasta was freshly made too. In other words, quality (expensive) ingredients. Unfortunately, similar to my comments on other expensive places, I can get these ingredients, I can make the dough, I can come up with a decent version of what I order from the comfort of my own kitchen making it visiting them not worth it. at least for me."}
{"text":"My home away from home. Food is on-point. Always fresh! Great welcoming staff. Awesome patio!"}
{"text":"Yikes. Went to the Adelaide location for a friend's birthday dinner and it wasn't the greatest experience. For the most part, the interior and decor was quite exceptional, a little dark but nice to look at - we even had a DJ that night (music was questionable tho). 

For a borderline bougie restaurant however, our waitress was pretty mediocre. Took our order, asked us how the food was, and never showed up until it was time to ask for the bill - standard procedure for waiters/waitresses working at any food joint (definitely expected more out of here). A lot of us were left there trying to get a server's attention half of the time. Not even tryna sound like a salty mans right now. 

As for the food, we got a bunch of things bc it was for a large group but from what I rmb (and took pics of) we got the pappardelle alla iosa, margherita pizza, and a calamari salad. 

You know what was most surprising tho - their selection of protein was close to none. My friend wanted a salad with chicken, but there were no salads except for the one with calamari - very small dish. Much of the pasta was either vegetarian or had homemade Italian sausage in them. It's funny bc the pasta my friend and I got tasted like a Chinese hand pulled noodle dish. As for the margherita pizza, it was extremely saucy and salty. 

Additionally, we got bread (yay) as appetizer with a side of olive oil, but one of my friends wanted the bread with some balsamic vinegar. He waited for over 10 minutes to get a waiter's attention (which they never came), so he went up to the kitchen and they told him they had none LOOOLL. It didn't make sense as some of their dishes had balsamic vinegar in them... 

It wasn't the best considering I had high hopes for this place, maybe I'll check out a different location next time."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 but it is definitely better than a 3-star rating. We ordered a pizza and a gnocchi dish. The ambiance was pleasant, seemed like a fancy place. And it is also a really big restaurant, with a lot of seating. 

The pizza was good. The only thing I didn't like was that the eggplant was hard to cut, and the fact that we had to cut the pizza ourselves. Maybe it was so that we could have freshly cut the pizza and added to the experience, but I would much rather have the pizza handed to me freshly cut. However the flavors were nice, and I did enjoy the crust of the pizza as well as it was light, thin, and added to the overall taste.

I never had gnocchi before so this is the first time I tried it. And for the first time, I enjoyed it, but it's not something I would crave to get again. The ricotta to pasta ratio was big, but even though there wasn't as much sauce, the sauce was definitely strong enough to give the gnocchi flavor. I couldn't really taste the pasta as much and could only taste more of the potato, but it's only because I love the taste of pasta and would rather have more of that. 

Overall its a good place. Not the best italian place but definitely not the least :)"}
{"text":"Best Italian place in Toronto. Great date spot. Their funghi assoluti (baked oyster mushroom) is a great appetizer (I'm not a vegetarian yet I really enjoyed it). Their pastas and margherita pizza are really good. It tends to be crowded so make reservations beforehand. The Adelaide location is definitely more crowded (you can barely hear each other speak). I would recommend going to this Yonge street location for sure."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a team dinner and it was great! We ordered a few salad appetizers but the two i'd probably recommend from the salads would be the Farinata con le Barbabietole (the chickpea pancake tastes like cheese which was so yum- but a little dry) and Calamari alla Griglia (which has generous amounts of squid). 

I had the truffle pasta and loved it. It comes in looking kind of small but it was so filling. The truffle shaving was just the right amount and the pasta itself was a perfect amount of chewiness. 

Had it not been a work dinner, I'd have taken pictures and posted! But you'll just have to take my word for it :)"}
{"text":"You'd think it would be good.  It has a nice layout, and a great location on Yonge.  Bartender-FAIL.  Guy was a total douche.  The first rule of customer service is that you actually serve the customers.  We were literally inconveniencing him to be there. (12 of us)  That's a pretty hefty pre-dinner drink bill.  Our server (Matt) was pretty cool, though he was bound by the policies of the joint.  No substitutions, no questions, no talking, etc.  They actually told us no when we asked for balsamic for the oil and bread.  Entrees were nothing to write back to Cicily about and dessert was the best.  Remember the no substitutions policy?  They were out of lemon gelato, so they asked to sub peach instead!!!  Are you kidding me? Going against your own douchey policy to screw the gelato out of us?
12 of us, no one felt served, no one felt blown away. So, if you have an extra thousand dollars laying around for your group and don't feel the need to be impressed, head on over to the Terroni on Yonge."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Never disappoint! Since the day I know about this place, I always come back at least once a month or sth! They are very authentic Italian food, not those grease pizza  or fast food paste. They did cook with passion and profession. Love their mozzarella pizza the most, simply delicious. The one and only seafood pasta with clam juice in it! Gin tonic cater to your wish with special tonic selections. Although I wish the reservation can be more easy to made, I guess they are just too popular! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Went here a little while ago with my girlfriend, since I had heard great things about their pizza. I also thought they would not allow me to take pictures. 

The decor was rather nice, and there were a lot of elements to it. Waiting in the middle of the restaurant for ten minutes was a little weird though.

Anyways, when it came to my waitress, the service was really good. She cheerfully answered any questions we had about the menu and offered great suggestions for dessert and the like. 

When it came to the food, I have to admit I may have gone in with expectations that were simply too high. We did like everything that we ordered -- a meat and cheese plate, magherita pizza, duck confit ravioli, and an orangy, vanilla gelato. However, for all the hype, I was a little let down by how good I thought it would be.

For a more detailed explanation about my experience at Adelaide's Terroni, feel free to visit my blog, located in my profile. :)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've never tried anything I didn't like here! From the pizzas to the pastas, the salads and desserts- it's all delicious and good quality food which is worth the money in my opinion. The butternut squash is delicious!! Although the portion is a bit small but I find it filling nonetheless. I just love the ambiance as well, and the patio in the summer is my favourite in Toronto! Cheap parking lot nearby on Price st. is an added bonus. One of my midtown favourites :)"}

Noise level very high
Pasta with sausage just ok

{"text":"Although my favourite Terroni in the city is the newest one up by Summerhill and Rosedale station (highly recommend going for their rooftop patio, it's one of the best hidden gems in the neighbourhood), the Queen West location has it's own perks and charms.

Service 
Pretty smooth from start to end. I received a phone call to confirm my reservations and they even asked if I wanted indoor or outdoor seating. Granted I went on a Monday night but it was still fairly buzzing in the dining rooms so it is nice to see places that do still do resos for the patio. Our waitress checked in regularly but wasn't disruptive or pushy. She also split all our checks properly on the first go (I know that sounds like something everyone should be able to do but there always seems to be some kind of mistake). 

Food
I've eaten at both the other Terroni locations so I can say the food is consistent here to the others. I had a charcuterie board which had a nice mix of cheeses and cured meats. My only complaint is I wish the board came with honey or preserve of some kind to pair with the cheese. The cheese board does so I imagined the meat and cheese would? My friends had a pizza and beet salad which also looked great.

Drinks
Although I got the bellini this time (which is perfect for a warm day out on the patio), I recommend the Terroni sour with amaretto. It's very easy to drink and has that perfect sweet and sour flavour. 

Overall Ambiance
This is a great place to go for a nice, casual drinks with friends, date or night out with the family. The backyard style patio is adorable and quiet/secluded from the city bustle. Only thing to keep in mind is Terroni is their \"our way or the highway\" attitude when it comes to their menus. If you are picky and want to make a starbucks-like series of modifications I would not recommend.

It isn't by any means the best Italian in Toronto, but Terroni gets top points for good selection of food, drinks and general service. I would recommend the midtown location first, than this one and last Adelaide (wasn't a huge fan of that one's layout)."}
{"text":"Dishes are a hit or miss, depending on what you order! Came here with a couple girlfriends after work due to its convenient location by the financial district. 
Here is what we ordered:
- I had the Rigatoni alla Norma, which was actually pretty good. It had deep fried eggplants, which weren't too oily, and just the right texture! The tomato sauce had good flavour and the texture of the pasta was perfect al dente! Would highly recommend! Although I did have my eyes on the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare because I love seafood pasta, I would probably still order this dish if I come back!
- My friend had the Ravioli di Zio Paperone, which was also good but was a bit too salty.
- My other friend had the Rigatoni del Poveraccio, which was not as good as the other two dishes IMO. Since the rigatoni is \"burnt grain\", the texture was actually pretty hard... like it felt like as if they barely even boiled the pasta.. 
- We also shared a tiramisu for dessert, which was actually really good! The cream was soft and the espresso flavour was not too strong. It was a good portion for sharing too."}
{"text":"I would like to begin by saying that we had to wait close to ONE HOUR to be seated at this restaurant. Please keep in mind, we had a reservation. This is unacceptable to me considering my experience in the service industry. I worked in the service industry for 15 years and I have never, not ONCE, let a guest wait for their table this long. The two lovely young women hosting seemed to be getting a lot of information about the tables through their fancy ear-piece-walkie-talkie gizmos. However, the implementation of such fancy technology failed to get us to our seats any sooner... We were expected to stand and wait near the door on a stormy, muggy evening. 

Back to the review, The waitress offered us a \"Meat and Cheese Platter\" as a consolation for out wait time. Me and my party were very excited about this platter until arrived and lacked cheese entirely. Our vegetarian friend was left hungry as the rest of devoured the (delicious) cured meat platter. Olives were a nice touch to the platter as well as crusty bread thingy's.

Once we me and my party got over the cheese incident, we began deciding what we would order. I knew I had to have the pizza. I do love me some pizza, yes. I opted for the Margharitta while others in my party had different pizza. The fresh arugula was very tasty and not over done. Sometimes, in my experience, there are issues keeping the arugula on the pizza and off the plate (or floor if you're clumsy like me) but I had no problems getting all of these greens into my stomach where they belong.

Side note: Our waitress was authentic and cool. She addressed me and my date as \"doctors\" when she asked for our IDs while taking our orders for a beer. We thought that was kind of strange but charming at the same time. Thanks for the laughs.

Back to the review, The pizza was so tasty i nearly ate the whole thing. YUM! to say the least. I still think about this pizza one week later. YUM to say the least indeed! My sister had a pasta and she said hers was very yummy also. 

Bingo! Dessert time. Gelato was fresh and tasty and i liked eating mine with spoon in hand, one more scoop PLEASE? Thank you very much, great gelato makes a great dessert. We also tried the butterscotch which was wonderful and came with a nice cookie for sharing, perfect for all of us to get a taste. We all loved it, shame it was so small!

{"text":"Hello my normal friend. Are you a normal guy, that dresses like a normal person, not like someone that just stepped out of an American Apparel catalog? Are you a normal Canadian that has grown up being used to Italian food as we define in North America, not as it is authentically served in some obscure small village in south of Italy? Are you of the kind that think an Italian restaurant should have alfredo pasta in their menu, regardless of how un-south Italian it is? Are you the low-class citizen that thinks peppers and parmesan is ok to have on your pasta dish, even if it offends the chef that painstakingly has made the $16 mix of spaghetti noodles and runny tomato sauce? Are you, like myself, apparently a very ignorant non-pasta connoisseur that thinks it is weird for your $16 spaghetti noodles and runny tomato sauce dish to be so tiny that it barely relieves your hunger, let alone have you hope for the tradition of taking it home for your lunch tomorrow as you are used to ever since you were little? Are you also not-so-in to think that your $16 tiny portion of spaghetti shouldn't be so doughy and hard under your teeth, the pasta gods be damned even if the spaghetti is handmade in the restaurant?

If you said \"yes\" to any of the above, get yourself and hungry stomach elsewhere. This is one of those place you have to \"get\" like all these other people that have given it 4 starts, because the quality, taste, or value, the criteria you and I may judge a place by, are simply not there. 

I just don't get all the positive reviews. This place was a waste of money. I went home afterwards and ate cereal because I will still hungry."}
{"text":"Food- We ordered the Frittura di Calamari which was fresh and had a perfect fried coating to it but I wish it had came with some type of sauce/dip.
For the entree I got the Tortelloni Ricotta while my partner got the Garganelli Geppetto (dandelions and spicy italian sausage (not spicy)), both of which were delicious.
I love me some free bread, but the crust on it was super hard and had a burntish/off taste to it that I preferred not to eat it- and I'm the person whose usually licking the breadcrumbs off the table! It was only served with oil, no vinegar or butter. Also we were a little disappointed with the size of the beer- expected a standard pint but only got a teeney 330ml, considering it was around the price of a typical pint.

Service- I appreciated the fast and friendly service, especially considering how packed the place was. I visited with my boyfriend on a weeknight and checked the \"Special Occasion - Anniversary\" box when making the reservation. The fact that it asked led me to believe that they would acknowledge it in some way, but we still found ourselves crammed in a busy, casual after-work-drinks section although there were definitely some more quieter intimate sections. Nonetheless the venue is beautiful!"}

{"text":"First visit in July 2017. Had the pasta with sausage dish. Excellent. Authentic and really good flavours. Pizza appetizers were excellent, calamari so-so. Patio  excellent place to sit in summer. Recommended."}
{"text":"Realllly great Southern Italian food! Im surprised this place only has 3.5 stars. Staff and chef were very accommodating to my gluten and dairy sensitivities. Nice specials and drink list. Friendly staff. Situated in an old courthouse! Expensive but well worth the price!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ended up coming to Terroni on a whim this evening. I've heard good things about it in the past, so I was looking forward to trying the food. We were seated right away: unfortunately, it was at a tiny table in a cramped basement. The room was loud and we had to scream at times in order to hear each other.
     
We wanted to start with the special for the day, burrata, but it was sold out. Instead, we got the octopus salad. The octopus itself was grilled perfectly. It was flavourful and not chewy at all. The salad was a bit strange though, warm romaine lettuce, potatoes and olives accompanied the octopus. It wasn't bad, but a cold, crisp salad would have complemented the dish better.
     
For our mains, we got the pasta with spicy sausage, mushrooms, and peas, and the pizza with nduja sausage and eggplant. The pasta was cooked al dente, which was nice. The sauce was to oily for my liking, however, tasting mostly of sausage grease. The mushrooms barely made it through. The pizza was better, thin and crisp. The nduja was delicious! 
     
Hands down the best part of the meal was the dessert. We got the chocolate cake, which actually turned out to be a chocolate lava cake with white chocolate sauce. It was to die for! 
     
3/5: Overall a decent experience, but nothing to write home about. I'd come back for the cake!"}
{"text":"If you're prepared to stomache some snobbery (no substitutions. Pizzas unsliced. No diet sodas!), they're food is great. Fresh pasta. Well executed salads. Delicious pizza. Don't forget to ask for a dish of their hot peppers, bc they're unreal."}
{"text":"After hearing tons of good things about Terroni, I suggested it for dinner with friends one night. The decor is cool, no doubt about that, but the food was pretty average and it's quite pricey. We sat on the patio which was really cute. I loved all the greenery and it had a really relaxed vibe. The server was friendly but not super attentive. The water glasses are teeny tiny which bugs me but they do provide you with a water jug to re-fill yourself. That said, we ran out of water pretty quickly and it wasn't replenished until the end of our meal. 

I got the Tortelloni di Ricotta (\"handmade spinach tortelloni filled with ricotta and pecorino with butter, sage and parmigiano\") and it was decent. The portion was smaller than I expected and it was sort of watery. Not terrible but not great either. One of my friends got the Farinata con le Barbabietole (\"chick pea pancake, roasted beets, heirloom carrots, ricotta salata, arugola, watercress, sunflower sprouts, pistachios, mint\") and really enjoyed it. The presentation was really nice too (for all the dishes).

I'm actually going to try the Adelaide location next week so hopefully the dish I choose is a little tastier. I'll definitely be referring to reviews so hopefully I'm not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at this Terroni location (much better than my meal at the one on Queen). The venue itself is beautiful and really interesting. Weird note but going to the bathroom feels like an adventure because of the prison cells along the way! It just had such a unique ambiance (the whole restaurant, not just the bathroom!) and the patio was perfect for a relaxing evening.

I got the Rigatoni Arcobaleno this time (mozzarella di bufala, zucchini, light cherry tomato sauce, basil) and it was so, so good. I really enjoyed it and the portion was sizable. The burrata was unreal. Every person at our table loved it--the tomatoes and bread it was served with made for a perfect combination of flavours. Lastly, we order the gelato; I had the hazelnut and vanilla flavours and...oh my god. Also, so good! 

Our server was charismatic, informative and friendly! I would definitely return and I'm really glad that I had a much more positive experience this time around. Every aspect impressed me!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. Have yet to have a bad meal. A bit noisy at night for dinner, (as are many small TO restaurants) which I don't mind but a worthwhile FYI."}
{"text":"Terroni is a nice restaurant to go to if you are not to sure where to reserve. I find it easy to get a reservation.

The food is systematically good. I usually have one of their pizza which are pretty good. Their pasta are also very good.

It is a great place to go in a group as you can order multiple plates and share (especially for the pizza).

They have a gluten free menu (unfortunetly it does not include pizza), but their gluten free pasta looks very good.

Their desserts are also very good. The chocolate cakes comes hot with melted chocolate in the middle. Their panna cotta was very light and good. Both of these are gluten free as well.

The ambiance is always good. I enjoy more this location compared to the one on Adelaide."}
{"text":"Food was very fresh and tasty. We ordered the daily special. It was exceptional.  Servers were very friendly to us. If you want to sit t the patio tho you might have to arrive very early.  They even have packaged sauces and food items to buy and take home. I will definitely come back even tho the price is on the higher end..."}
{"text":"Just go. And get the spinach pasta. Oh, and wine. Of course :)"}
{"text":"Way too pretentious.

I read the reviews and understood there are no substitutions on dishes. I can handle that.

But when the calamari came without any sauce and I asked fro some sort of dipping sauce (spicy oil, tomato sauce, anything!) I was told, rather snootily, \"we don't make substitutions here\".

FYI Terroni - you're food isn't that good. And your dry tasteless calamari certainly needs more than the squeezed lemons it comes with.

Pizza was sub-par. Libretto is easily 10 times better."}
{"text":"Food here was ok. I love gnocchi so I had to try that. I did find that my gnocchi was a little colder in the middle, seeming to be frozen still. The reason why this review is only 2 stars is because the service was TERRIBLE. We went around 5 pm (early dinner) and even when the restaurant was basically empty, the service was so bad. When we wanted to pay our bill, we waited almost 45 minutes just to do that. We noticed that a group that came in about 30 minutes after us, who also received their bill after us, got to pay before us. That ruined it for me and my friend."}
{"text":"went to terroni last night, and was surprised how busy the place was... but luckily there was no need to wait, and we were seated immediately in the 2nd floor dining area.

on any given night, i think terroni is decent. the best of the decent in this neighbourhood for italian. a little pricey for the portions, in my opinion.

however, last night the food was quite good. not sure what kind of olive oil they used, but it was very refreshing. the bolognese sauce was meaty and extremely tasty. the affogatto was well done as the scoop of ice cream had a layer of chocolate poured over it, and re-frozen, prior to the shot of espresso being poured on. very nice touch with the chocolate.

would go again... except that the line-ups are always ridiculous. maybe i'll open another italian joint in the area because clearly... the demand is there :)"}
{"text":"I've been to all 3 locations and this one is my favourite because of the amazing rooftop. The food is always good (pastas, apps, salads, pizza, desserts). I haven't had a bad meal here yet. I was there last weekend and we got great service. It was busy as usual but there was a lot of staff around to ensure service was quick and efficient. Our server was always around to make sure we had everything we needed - to order extra food/drinks or to refill our water glasses. Yet it never felt like he was hovering or pressuring us. That's good service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We came here on a weeknight and it was just packed! Both the pasta and pizza we got was delicious. We live nearby and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for Friday night dinner with friends, having previously tried the Summerhill location. Overall was pretty disappointed. The service was very bad and confusing (our server disappeared for a long time and we had other people come to our table). They messed up our appetizer order. And then for the main course I ordered a pizza that I'd tried and loved at the other Terroni location. It didn't quite taste the same and was disappointing. Our whole party had a similar experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! The bolognese pasta and gnocchi are to die for. The pizzas are absolutely amazing, cooked to perfection and u can tell they use quality ingredients, the tiramisu is a MUST if you are considering dessert. There are a few things that could use improvement though.... seating is EXTREMELY crammed, almost as if you are sitting at the same table with strangers. Service is always very rushed, and staff are usually very impersonal. For a restaurant of its class the servers should have a uniform to make them easier to identify, as they were pretty much wearing whatever they want. Wine is expensive, 12$ + for a FIVE ounce glass, which seemed pretty far fetched.  All in all, amazing food and deserts but service, seating and wine pricing could be improved."}
{"text":"Recently went here for lunch for the third time in a year.  Each experience was progressively worse and this last one was so bad I felt compelled to write a review.

I was there with a friend on a Friday for lunch. It was not busy.  Yet, the food was terrible, service was just ok and their ruthless approach to no substitutions made it a joke.

We ordered a caprise salad which comes just with olive oil.  We asked for some balsamic to also put on it.  They would not provide it.  They admitted they had it.  We offer to pay extra for it. We ask them to just bring a few drops on the side.  No way.

One of the salads we ordered was the Farinata con le Barbabietole.  I'll just say it was terrible. Cut so that it is very hard to eat and their chick pea pancake in it was like cold chalk. 

Couple that with a space the makes it impossible to have a conversation and all I can say is stay away."}
{"text":"I have only been to Terroni's a handful of times, and only the old courthouse location.  Each and every time I have gone I've been very impressed with the décor, ambience, and quality of food while service remained at par. After browsing many reviews online, it became quite evident that this is a chain that does not pride itself on service, especially the Queen St. location which has one of the worst service reps I have ever encountered.  Having said that, let's talk food. 

The majority of the antipastos are delicious. I always order the carpaccio di manzo, a dish I typically order when I eat out I-tal. The Frittura di Calamari is great as well, a lightly battered deep fried calamari complimented well with lemon.  If you are with a group I highly recommend ordering the Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo, a selection of Italian/local meats and cheeses. On a few occasions I recall having prosciutto di parma, smoked prosciutto, hot calabrese salami, fontina, smoked scamorza, pecarino, and parm + more, I do believe these are constantly changing day to day. 

I have not tried a pasta dish at Terroni's that I didn't enjoy. They also carry traditional types of pasta which you don't find everywhere like: Orecchiette, papardelle, garganelli and tagliatelle.  Most of the pastas such as the delicious gnocci are handmade in house, I personally heart the Mezze Maniche al Ragu d'Anatra, a duck ragu with spinach, mascarpone and parm.  

As for the pizza, it is truly a-ma-zing, they really do rival Pizzeria Libretto. Terroni's has at least 20 pizzas and really you can't go wrong, even with the basic Margherita or Marinara. This may be attributed to the fact that Terroni's imports and packs they're own tomatos, in addition to making house specialties such as the homemade spicy sausage.  My favourite, like many others is the Smendozzatta pizza: Tomato, mozza, homemade spicy sausage, gorgonzola, and red onions. This pizza is one of my favourite meals, period. It must have to do with the combination of flavour such as the mozza and gorgonzola melting and fusing with the house sausage and caramelizing onions, omg.   

Other notable pizzas are the Natalina: Tomato, mozza, roasted red peppers, hot calabrese salami, garlic and olives. C't Mang: White pizza w/ mozza, gorgonzola, fresh pears, speck (smoked prosciutto), walnuts and honey. Quattro Stagiono: Tomato, mozza,  prosciutto di Parma,  eggplant,  zucchini and olives. 

If you have space for desert, let it be known Terroni's boasts the most popular desert item I have ever come across in my life. I know some girls, including my g/f, who would give up everything for just one bite. The item is a flourless dark chocolate lava cake which is so good that Terroni's could probably stay open just selling that desert. 

All in all if you're looking for a stand out Italian dinner full of delicious apps, pastas, pizza and a to-die-for desert Terroni's is your spot. Personally I prefer Pizzeria Libretto, but Terroni's is right up there, and open longer than 5pm to 11pm!

{"text":"We went to Terroni for a friend's birthday dinner. It was an absolute disaster. 

The birthday was ruined. Service was completely unaccommodating and full of attitude. Furthermore, the food was nothing special and certainly did not reflect the price. The music was \"club-y\", which made it very difficult to converse. While the restaurant claims to maintain a traditional Italian image (i.e. REFUSED to serve balsamic vinegar with bread and oil, add any extra garlic, or accommodate ingredient substitutions), the music and decor suggested otherwise.

Very unimpressed and do not plan on returning. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Very friendly staff, great food, and amazing atmosphere. They turned off the lights for earth hour, and brought us all candles. Neat experience!"}
{"text":"- beautiful building, however, it's terrible for accoustics. i found myself having to really speak up and listen hard to conversations.
- food was hit and miss with the items we ordered.
** ostrich carpaccio - truffle oil and tall bird meat go very well together
** fresh tuna, black olive, cherry tomato penne (cant remember the fancy italian name it was given) was really average. yes, non-canned tuna is great. but just not in pasta. and the olives were really overpowering...
** sausage and truffle pasta (again, cant remember the name) was dynamite. i got totally out-ordered and kept asking for samples from my dining partner. 
** affogatto - very good. the fact that the gelato is dipped in chocolate first makes the first pour of espresso on top dynamite.
- wouldnt come back soon, but wouldnt stay away if my night or weekend took me here...."}
{"text":"Rude service, staff thinks because they have an Italian accent they can be pretentious. Over priced pizza. LITTLE CAESARS HOT AND READY is better. Go to Queen West instead, better and authentic Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I have only been back in Toronto for about six weeks now, and yet I have somehow been to this Terroni twice. Why, I ask myself? It can't be the food or the service. Basically, it's for the location and the size. This place is big, and feels even bigger with the vaulted ceilings. This also means it's very, very noisy when it's full. 

I come from an Italian family, which makes me really picky about my pasta. Each time I have eaten here I've had a pasta, and it's always perfectly done, and their tomato sauces are fantastic. However, I am really bothered by the \"no parmesan on seafood  pasta\" rule they have. No substitutions, I understand. But no parmesan, if that's what I want? When you are already at my table, grating parmesan onto my lucky fellow diners' plates? Come on. From what I've experienced, Italians put parmesan on whatever they want. 

The service is, in a word, adequate. Not overly friendly, not (underly?) friendly, but they aren't really putting in anything extra. They did do a  good job of recommending a wine, which was useful as they have a lot of non-LCBO wines. 

So, all in all, not a bad place if you are eating with more than a few people and don't mind speaking up to your fellow diners. Not the greatest place for an intimate outing, though the baby that made up patron #5 of my group managed to sleep the whole time."}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions and can confidently say that this is one of the better Italian restaurants in Toronto. The food here, particularly the pizza, is based on southern Italian fare served in a more upscale environment. They've got a really expansive menu with dozens of pizza and pasta dishes to choose from, as well as rotating daily specials.

All the pasta dishes I've tried here (butternut squash ravioli & gnocchi) have been light and delicious. Of course, it's not as saucy or homely as more authentic, homemade pasta places but it's great for when you want a fancier, but not pretentious, dinner. The grilled eggplant pizza I didn't love so much, but that's probably just my personal bias against thin crust pizzas. 

I'd say the service here varies. The first time I came, my server was super attentive and helpful with explaining the menu. He even suggested the most perfect wine pairing to go with my ravioli - I'd come back here just for the wine! The second time, my server didn't really seem interested in serving us, which made the experience feel less personal. 

Overall, I'd recommend this place because of the expansive menu and nice ambience - each of the floors of the restaurant has a sort of different feel, with my favorite being the top floor with the wine bar! You gotta come here multiple times to get the full experience."}
{"text":"in toronto on business and wandered in there around 9pm on a wednesday .... place was very busy but was easily accommodated at a 2top tot he right of the bar.

Girl who brought me my food and drinks was far more personable. anyways will definetly venture next time in town. decent QPR"}
{"text":"Overpriced and pretentious. Ordered a frito misto-type appetizer which consisted of ricotta stuffed squash blossoms and some type of deep fried sausage things. Squash blossoms were very dry, sausage things were super greasy and sat on a sprinkling of salad greens and grape tomatoes.  Paid $16 for about $5 retail worth of food. Wife ordered a sausage pasta dish which came sprinkled w/ greyish truffle slices.  She could not taste the normally subtle truffles because the dish was heavily seasoned w. some type of overpowering cheese and greasy spicy sausage. What a waste of (gray? white? (we could not tell)) truffles.  Kid and I had pizzas. I had a very dry, sparsely anchovied pizza and the kid had a spicy sausage pizza, which at least was not dry.  As an aside, they have a $99 steak on the menu.  I asked what made the steak worth $99 and I was told it is a \"big steak\" (listed as 35oz.).  I have eaten in steak restaurants around the world but, this was the first $99 steak I have seen for one person.  Hostess scooted off like a dog w. its tail between its legs, when I responded to her std. \"how is the food?\" question w. an \"ehh . . . okay\".   Toronto serves pretty good food throughout the city.  I'm sure you could find better elsewhere."}
{"text":"The people I was with love this place I was very underwhelmed.  It was very noisy, crowded and cramped even with a reservation at 8 PM on a Thursday night. 

Had pizza and salad.  Was ok but high priced. Chocolate dessert was delicious!

Server was very knowledgeable about the wine list and was able to give options based on preferences."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. 

They are extremely pretentious and rude. 

I took my parents here who were visiting, my mom ordered a simple pasta, but wanted penne instead of spaghetti, but of course they don't do substitutions, my dad ordered a pizza. My mom wanted some parmesan cheese and asked the waitress for some who rolled her eyes and seemed annoyed at the fact that someone would dare to ask. She eventually brought some and insisted that she would put the parmesan on my moms pasta and not let her do it herself, my mom refused and convinced her to let her put her own parmesan, then my dad wanted to put some parmesan on his pizza and the waitress grabed the parmesan out of his hands and said that it is not allowed to put parmesan on the pizza. Where do they get off telling you what you can or can't put on your own food.  

I ordered a salad, it was very dry so I requested some balsamic vinegar, which is when the waitress lost it and said they don't have balsamic vinegar to which I reply \"what kind of Italian restaurant doesn't have balsamic vinegar\" and she replies \"a good one, our food doesn't need any extras it is made to perfection because our chefs know what food is supposed to taste like.\"  so I grab my coke and poured it on my salad and say \"at least now its not dry\" her head almost exploded. 

After this whole commotion she eventually came back to clear our table and asked if we wanted some dessert or coffee, I said I would love some coffee but I don't want any because I might not be able to put sugar in it, she rolled her eyes again and said of course you can put sugar in your coffee\" I reply \"I don't want to risk it, you might have a stroke if you see me defiling your precious coffee.\"

I asked for the bill and paid by card. I didn't leave a tip with the card but instead I left her a 25c tip and walked off, she came chasing after me and said \"sir you forgot your change\" I reply \"it's yours, you earned every penny\" and I walked out the door. 

Safely to say I will not be taking any high profile clients here but I might return just to annoy  the waitress."}
{"text":"Let's start with the unforgivable:

As we patiently waited for our window table to be wiped clean I observed the waitress clean the seats first in a few swift motions and then the table.  Yes, you read correct: cleaned the seat and then the table.  

W. T. F.

I know that rag probably wasn't that clean to begin with because rags used to wipe down everything usually aren't... but AS IF.  Who would DO that?  Disgusting! Horrible.  It ruined the meal for me.  I couldn't get over it that she would do that.

We ordered a cheese board which was really great and I picked a salad (as usual).  I think the garnishes on my salad were nice.  My bestie ordered some vegetarian thing that she liked.  The most memorable thing was the cheese board.  That's the only positive/memorable thing I have to say.

When we had a different waitress switch to serve us I made sure to get new cutlery because my fork accidentally touched the table.

I was actually recommended any of Terroni's affiliated restaurants by a Toronto Life food photographer a few years ago on an airplane ride.  She raved about how awesome they were and I've bought many a sandwich and pastry from Sud Forno for my boyfriend who is extremely picky and a huge foodie. I was very excited to try this place out for myself (since I am gluten free, I can't exactly grab a 'wich from 'Forno and I'm not huge of pastries without an occasion)... you can probably imagine my disappointment when I saw the rag scrub the seat than the table.

PLEASE train your waitstaff better or hire ones that you don't have to teach common sense to.  I've NEVER experienced such a horrible and disgusting action in my life.  Will NOT recommend. Will NOT be going to Sud Forno again either."}
{"text":"I was completely underwhelmed by Terroni. I can't remember the exact name of what I ordered (not that I even want to) but steer cheer of the pasta with zucchini shrimp and yellow sauce. The pasta was overdone, and the shrimp + sauce had no zest or flavor whatsoever. 

Simply put, don't waste your time. Go down the street to one of a kind pasta and grill. You'll be 1000x happier."}
{"text":"I was here for a work function and we reserved the private dinning room. The restaurant was completely packed on a Wednesday night which should be a good sign.

First the GOOD:

- The private dinning room is very nice and holds 10-15 people. You get a private server so the service was above average.

- The restaurant decor was nice, lot's of woods with Italian touches.  

- I sampled a few of the pizzas - they were all very good. The C'T Mang (with Pears) and the Smendozza (with spicy sausage) were my favourite. Highly recommended. 

- The Gnocchi was good but I was a little disappointed, I had better.  

- They had some decent beer choices, even some German selections on Tap.

- Everyone really enjoyed the desserts. I had a flour less chocolate tart with Ganache. Heavenly. 

And the NOT so GOOD:

- Pasta portion size was ridiculously small. The Gnocchi portion included about 10-12 small Gnocchi pieces. My entree was a third of the size of all my co-workers. I was still hungry after dinner.

- Calamari alla Griglia, AKA - Grilled calamari was over cooked. A shame as the bed of tomatoes and salad were excellent. Actually had a burnt grill taste.

- As I took a tour of the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how loud it is in the dinning areas - just deafening. I'm glad we were in the private room.

- It feels overcrowded, the tables are too close together - contributes to the noise. 

- Although not nearly as bad as Joeys Eaton Centre, expect a long journey to the washrooms. 

If not for the private dinning room and accompanying service, I think I might have went with 2 - 2.5 stars. Food was hit or miss on my visit and the dinning room noise would have driven me nuts.

{"text":"Everything's been said in the reviews. Food is incredible. Building is amazing. Love the servers. 

Only wish they would cut our pizzas for us. 
Try the zucchini blooms. It's a must. 
Also ask for fresh basil leaves. They'll give to you free of charge and it makes your pasta or pizza a million times better."}
{"text":"Great location-it use to be a court house so it's interesting to be in a place with history. Food was absolutely amazing. They have a lot of vegetarian options. I tried the rigatoni pasta and it was so fresh. The mozzarella made the dish and everyone at the table was happy with their meal. I would love to go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a dinner, just make sure you have a reservation. 
When I arrived with a reservation in hand, I was quickly seated - others who did not seemed to be on about a 40 minute wait. 

The staff took care of my co-worker and me, and was on top of drink refills. 
The calamari was great as an appetizer, we both enjoyed our food and drinks.

Note, that this place is a bit tight on space, and can get loud, so not the best if you were coming for a romantic date. 

The only weirdness here is that they seem to be the only restaurant in the world who does not split checks, so be ready for that."}
{"text":"Very judgy. Won't let people order diet soft drink because they have decided diet soft drinks are bad for people. Food okay. Service pleasant (aside from the attitude about what drinks I can and cannot order). 

I wouldn't have come here if I'd know my only choice was full sugar drinks or water"}
{"text":"Have been anxious to try the new location - was so upset when the Balmoral location closed. Finally went last night with 3 friends - fantastic!!!! From the fact that we were able to get a reservation (old Terroni didn't take reso's) to the fantastic food and wonderful service. With 2 seatings we thought we'd get rushed but not the case...we gabbed and gabbed and never felt rushed. Had the Garganelli Geppetto pasta - a fave.   Pizza's delicious and massive - perfect for sharing. Service was excellent - relaxed but on top of everything. I can't wait to go back and check out BarCentrale. The decor is so 'switched on' - best bathrooms in the city."}
{"text":"Today we  were three people and went for lunch to terroni. It was a late lunch and the  employee who was in charge of seating wanted us to sit in the lounge. As soon as we asked to speak to the manager, we were seated appropriately upstairs. There were plenty of empty tables and we were puzzled as to why they would not seat us properly in the first place. The employee for seating was young and inexperienced. She said, \"I am only following the policy of the Restaurant.\"
The menue is vast with an array of Italian dishes. The restaurant was unable to accommodate my requests for some simple food changes. Balsamic vinegar would not be given to add to the olive oil for bread dipping. Our server gave us some sort of strange explanation why....but it did not make any sense to a customer who just wanted some vinegar!! Really!!  Plain vegetables either steamed or grilled or pan fried were not available. Substitute this with a plain slice  cucumber or cut tomatoe were not offered. I was so disappointed .  The server or the restaurant just will not go the extra mile to have a satisfied clientele. Too bad, so sad...."}
{"text":"Not as hyped of a space as advertised. The only plus for the interior is the two huge antique mirrors they have. 
The food is above average, but not amazing. Service is below average and to the point of rude at times. A couple of times we've been in, we've gotten great tables even with the stroller and at that moment you think it's gonna be a great night and boom, the bad service kicks in like a tumor.
Will give them another couple of tries, just because we should."}
{"text":"Terroni is located in the old Toronto courthouse which means the ambience in general is quite nice, but something about the old stone/brick walls gives the place horrible acoustics, it tends to get pretty loud in here. Other than that, the place is decorated nicely. 

Food:
Terroni serves great, simple and classic Italian food. Their pastas are freshly-made and their thin-crust pizzas are some of the best I've had in Toronto. The most recent time I went, I tried the pizza cosi which was delicious - came topped with porcini mushrooms, mozzarella, and prosciutto. My friend tried their daily special which was a monkfish baked in a salt casing/crust, which they brought to the table so we could watch them crack the shell and debone the fish - a nice touch. 

Service:
Terroni's reservation system is weird (more on that later), but my party of 4 had no trouble getting a table promptly at 7pm on a Thursday night. Our server was friendly and attentive, which was expected - nothing special to report here. 

Unfortunately Terroni suffers from a few quirks that become quite annoying. For some reason, your entire party must be present before they will seat you. Another thing is that in their premise to provide \"authentic\" Italian fare they absolutely will not do substitutions in dishes, and also make a point of noting on the menu that certain dishes will not come with balsamic vinegar, parmigiana, etc. in order to \"maintain authenticity\", which is kinda pretentious in my opinion.   

Overall, prices are reasonable given the location, and I'll definitely be coming back for their good food."}
{"text":"I would give Terroni three stars but the last time I came to this location, I was highly disappointed.

I came to this location for a friends birthday and we were a large group (12 people or so) but our reservation time was honoured and we were seated quickly as we came in. 

I ordered the Ravioli di Zio Paperone which was a bigger portion that I expected but none the less up to par. My friend ordered the Garganelli Geppetto and thought it was okay but nothing too special. In addition to the pastas, we also ordered several appetizers to share among our large party. Overall, the food was decent. 

However, we were quite disappointed when they brought out the cake that our friend had dropped off earlier in the day for the dinner to surprise the birthday girl. It was an ice cream cake but they didn't put it in the freezer so the cake was half melted and the letters starting to smear. They took it away quickly after we took pictures and it didn't come back for a long time. The reason was being it was so melted they had to scoop it into bowls and serve it to us. After such disappointment, a manager came out and apologized for the mix up and took off the cake cutting fee. The overall experience was disappointing but I'm hoping this was a one off experience and it will be better for future visits."}
{"text":"I find it interesting how each Different location has a completely different appearance and vibe. This one is very chique and hip  as a layout. Very cozy and perfect for an intimate outing or conversation, date or outing with close friends, etc. service is always on the ball and quick. It's a very lovely dining experience. Every food item I've had here has been delicious, fresh and well prepared, with lovely presentation. Pricing can vary depending  on what menue item you choose but most are well priced. They have an extensive wine selection and drinks list that pairs very well with the entrees."}
{"text":"Mmm. The food was good. Ordered the duck confit stuffed ravioli. I think I might have inhaled it. My friend ordered the swordfish pasta but it was severely undercooked. I get that it's busy but the service was quite disappointing. Our table was right next to the server's ordering station or whatever and he walked past by us quite often - It would have been nice to make some eye contact atleast just in case we needed something, instead of waiting for us to flag him down.

Lovely decor and interior and good food for a night out with friends. Private rooms available downstairs by the wine cellar

PS - they have this chilli pepper mix if you ask for .. it was so good we ended up buying a can each from the store!"}
{"text":"Great spot to take a date or your buddies or your parents for that matter. Its got a very trendy/hipster feel to it (servers wearing whatever they wish). 

We started with some mixed greens and the weekly special Minestrone soup which was very hearty and gave me the impression they had been stewing it since morning. Thumbs up!

My friend ordered the Prosciutto and gorgonzola pizza and I had the spaghetti In Canna a Mare (seafood). Pizza was a good size (these are personal pizzas not meant for sharing) and quite tasty. Traditionally Italian with very little sauce. The pasta was good all around and I was surprised at the amount of seafood in it. The jumbo scallop and shrimp were of top quality, so was the calimari. Overall a nice meal and at 75$ + tip we were happy with the price and most importantly we left feeling good. No bloating, burping or stomach gases. 

Our server Adriano was very professional with a thick Italian accent, he even playfully corrected us on the pronounciation of the menu items and made a couple good reccomendations."}
{"text":"We decided to try Terroni since our original choice, Craft Beer Market was closed due to furnace issues.  

Despite the freezing cold weather, it was fairly busy at lunch.  We all ordered the pizzas  Unfortunately there weren't many vegetarian options.  I chose the marinara which was excellent.  Even though it was very simple, the sauce was very flavourful and garlicky.  The thin crust was crispy and light.  It was hard to stop eating the bread with olive oil and peperoncini piccanti for dipping.  A good thing the pizzas were thin crust!  Service was cheerful and efficient.

This restaurant is located in a gorgeous historic building which served as the old courthouse from 1852-1900.  Washrooms are in the basement as is another room for private functions.  At the time of our visit, it looked like a birthday party was in progress.  Also their wine cellar appears to be the old jail cells."}
{"text":"Friendly if not understated service. Pizzas were yummy and filling, but paying $50 for pizza without alcoholic drinks is a bit crazy. Id go back, it's what I expected."}
{"text":"Extremely offended by this location. They refused to make a minor substitution so we left. Wait staff was rude.  Too bad we won't return to ant locations now. Very disappointed. Washrooms were very dirty too.  Manager was even more rude and very aloof. Just cause you're busy now you keep this up as you won't be."}
{"text":"Great Italian upscale but dress down restaurant in heart of downtown.

Super thin pizza, hanger steak and eggplant parm was awesome

Finished up with Tiramisu and a killer toasted croissant stuffed with Nutella and almonds..

Really nice place!!"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago after a 3 year hiatus. Wanting to take advantage of the sunny weather, we were promptly seated on the patio.

The waiter, seemed to be attentive and helpful with questions I had about the menu, helping me naoow down my choices. It was approximately 4:45-4:50ish and my friend wanted to order the panini, which is no longer served at 5. He said she couldn't order it so I had to pipe in and state the time. The waiter ended up taking her order for the panini.

I ordered the Don Corrado pizza, which I found to be quite bland.
All the topping were placed in the middle of the pizza instead of evenly dispersed. Also, those potatoes needed some spices or seasoning. 

My friends enjoyed their meals for the most part. 

Much to our dismay nearing the end of our meal, when we looked at other tables, everyone else was offered fresh bread. 

Our waiter failed to bring bread to our table, or at least offer some.
I'm generally not interested in bread, but it's the principle of the matter. With the 20% gratuity I left, it would have been nice to have the choice. 

I will be returning for the food - not the service, or lack there of. 
I recommend ordering a salad, a pasta and a pizza to share family style for 3 or more people. My friends have dietary restrictions so we were unable to do this."}
{"text":"WHAT THE HEY HEY.
 
Terroni is probably the best Italian restaurant I've been to in Toronto and it is now easily one of my top choices for Italian foodz. I would come back here again. HELL, THEY PLAYED KPOP. Bonus points, okay? 
 
How was this place not on my radar?? How did I find this place out through my BF?? HOW HAVE I NOT HAVE KNOWN?!??!!? *All food cred is ruined*I mean, I do really like Piano Piano, but wow that place is EXPENSIVE.
 
Terroni has really nice vibes. There are 3 floors to the restaurant, and the entire atmosphere was just fun and fancy. It didn't seem like a place where elegant people came to dine, but everyone who just wants to enjoy a good time and have some great food. 
 
I had dinner here with some of my BF's international extended family and it would have been weird and rude to take all the pictures of my food (and everyone else's food), so unfortunately, I did not get any pictures.
 
For the appetizers, I ordered the fried calamari because I love fried calamari and it was THE BEST CALAMARI I'VE EVER HAD IN FOREVER. It was crispy, crunchy, really well seasoned, and it didn't taste frozen to me at all. (If it is frozen, then WOW, BEST FRIED FROZEN CALAMARI). My BF ordered the chickpea pancake salad with roasted beets. It's called farinata con le Barbabietole. He's in love with chickpeas, but I did think it was a strange salad. When I asked him what he thought about it, he just said: \"Weird. Weird texture and tasteles, at least for someone who eats chickpeas at least once a week.\" 
 
For my main, I got the ravioli stuffed with duck and butternut squash. Butternut squash has seriously become one of my favorite ingredients, ever. I always cook with it, I always want to order it. I also really love duck. The ravioli pasta itself was a green color, which I'm not entirely sure what it was from? (Spinach?) But it tasted amazing and surprisingly, I was really full. I would love to come back again and try another one of their pastas. (I think I would try the seafood pasta next time, Spaghetti in Canna a Mare).
 
I ordered the gelato for dessert. You get to select 2 flavors so I got the hazelnut and the chocolate. The chocolate completely overwhelmed the hazelnut, but I would definitely go for the hazelnut and vanilla next time. Gelato tasted great! (You gotta ask the server for the available flavors). 
 
Overall, I had a really good time here. Everything was amazing, the vibe was amazing, and all the servers were so helpful and friendly.
 
TLDR; Best Italian restaurant I've been to, great food and great service, but the highlight of my night was THE KPOP SONG."}
{"text":"Like (not love)/Hate. 
Like because the food is actually delicious. It's always consistently good but hate because they won't substitute or be accommodating on certain requests. 
This is a restaurant, people eat at restaurants and pay good $$ so that they can enjoy it. If you can accommodate a customer to make sure he/she would have a great meal, why not just do it? With buca and enoteca sociale around, I can't say that I miss this place at all anymore."}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is that it is incredibly convenient. It is right downtown and is very accessible. The design is quite lovely and intimate setting making it a nice dinner spot for a date or intimate outing. It is quite pricey but I always end up having left overs so portions are pretty fair."}
{"text":"Terroni is a decent restaurant with mostly good food, knowledgeable waiters and decent wine. However, the food here is NOT worth the line ups and the pasta is inconsistent and a bit pricey given the quality/portions. 

Here's how the meal broke down:
- Arrived at 5pm on Sunday (early!) and scored the last table, right near the door. Big mistake, as we sat down next to the door I knew the line up would start to bug my dining companions who are used to more spacious suburban restaurant. All that said, this all just equals Mostly because it's NOT WORTH THE WAIT, PEOPLE. (no effect on stars, just stating the facts)
- Knowledgeable waiter suggested a mid-priced wine (delicious) and really tasty salads. +2 star.
- Salads were all tasty and the portions were HUGE, great value! +1 star
- Pasta recommendations were lacklustre and the not very tasty. -1 star
- They REFUSED to add parmigiana to a seafood pasta dish. I am telling you, if you bill yourself as \"authentic\" Italian, you should never tell an Italian they cannot put parmigiana on their damned pasta. -1 star
- The pizzas were tasty and very \"authentic\", definitely worth the dollars and reminded me of the time I've spent in Italy. +2 stars
- Despite a good start, our waiter was not available throughout the meal and barely checked in with us. We would have bought some more of that delicious wine, for sure. -1 star

I'll try to avoid going back, especially if there's a line. Even the delicious pizzas and salads were not enough to make me wait. And don't bother ordering the pasta if you're looking for an authentic experience - it's not that great and the portions are too small.

Also, please note they don't make martinis. This includes Manhattans. So you've been warned!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu. We didn't know about the patio, so we ate inside.  On our way out, we did see the patio -- perhaps we would have enjoyed that.

The menu has many choices, and everyone enjoyed their meal except for one of us (she didn't care for the sauce on her spaghetti).  My Margherita pizza was good, but I didn't realize that I needed to order the Bufala Margherita to get fresh mozzarella.  Oh well.

Definitely on the pricey side for lunch -- I was a bit surprised at the bill we racked up.  

Service was friendly and polite, but somewhat inattentive.  They weren't that busy, and it seemed like our water bottle was always empty.  Four people go through a small bottle pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Came to Terroni for our 2018 Mother's Day dinner. While we were prepared for it to be a busy night, the restaurant clearly has not. Tables were packed together so close that seatbacks were knocking together. The servers were struggling to take care of all their assigned tables, food was leaving the kitchen at a snail's pace. 

Orders were mixed up even after correcting them with our waitress the first time around. The food was on par when it was finally corrected and arrived. Good ingredients and well prepared. It took two and a half hours to finish our meal to get out. 

Terroni seems to be a victim of its success as we've been visiting various of their locations and never had such a poor experience as this. There are plenty of other great Italian restaurants in the city, but Terroni seems to have fallen behind. Too bad..."}
{"text":"Loved the interior design, but the amount of time it took me to find the washroom was annoying - need better signage.  We sat on the patio and the service was pretty weak.  We sat for a long time with the menus closed, staring at a bunch of servers, who just chatted with each other lazily.  

We shared the buffalo mozzarella to start.  The cheese was good, but we both thought it needs balsamic vinegar and salt - of course, you can't ask for it because it's Terroni, and they don't let you eat how you want to eat.  For my main, I had the pizza that had the four different kinds (quattro something or other).  It was good, I liked it.  My date had the pork chop - some of the sides were inedible, the pork chop was poorly seasoned.  Yawn.

The saving grace was my cocktail, some orange/prosecco drink that rocked."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I have had in the city. I had the Li Pecuri pizza - the dough used in the crust is nice (charred yet chewy- which is something I look for), nice sauce, cheese and topping - not overdoing it.

The reason I am giving it a lower rating is because the service was not up to mark. The servers took some time to show up, but the food it quick too arrive once you place the order. The prices are also a bit high."}
{"text":"Located in the historical Courthouse building in downtown Toronto- this location is the place to go for an authentic italian food, with a trendy crowd. The building itself has remained true to it's herritage- preserving the original jail cells in the basement which now serve as the washrooms. Patrons are met at the entrance by staff in a chic bar area with a private party room to one side. Follow through to the expansive main dining area and and beautifully rustic outdoor patio reminiscent of many hot spot bar/restaurants in Italy. The food- fantasic- I highly recommend the \"funghi assoluti\"  as apristomaco but my only criticism is that they do not allow for modifications/substitutions. Other than this small detail I love Terroni on Adelaide and I know you will too."}
{"text":"i love the patio! so nice, romantic, cute, perfect. the food here is amazing here, its italian and its prepared very elegantly, fresh fresh fresh. most things are a made in house, the olives were to die for. the pasta is alaways perfect and not too starchie, the sandwich was full of fresh ingredients. it does get busy and filled up so there can be a bit of a wait, but if u want some really nice Italian food this is it, and oh the wine, tons of wine, some thing for every one!!! check it out! it will be worth it"}
{"text":"The food at Terroni is consistently good, however the service is a bit frustrating. 

I will describe my experience last night:

We were a group of 12 which meant our bill would have an 18% auto grat, and the service was horrendous.  Our server opted to wait until EVERYBODY had ordered before bringing out bread. This took over half an hour. We requested bread several times throughout this process.

Our water jugs remained empty for over twenty minutes and the bus boy didn't even check for them when he removed our used wine glasses. We had to request more water. This is unacceptable IMO. 
 
In general, Terroni is not the most accommodating restaurant--no menu substitutions, no scissors or pizza cutters for the pizza, no soda, no bill splitting--but last night I felt it more than I ever have in the past. 

 The food is, as I said, consistently good. 

I had the grilled Calamari and I highly recommend the mushroom Salad. All the pizzas are delicious, as long as you don't mind a bit of work (cutting). I can't comment on the pasta as I am not into pasta.

I only come to Terroni when other people make the plan. I would NEVER select this restaurant on my own. I prefer to be treated better when I go out.

If you do come here I suggest you make a reservation. I also advise against coming in a large group."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place!  Great place for gatherings.  Friendly service, energetic atmosphere.  I love noise, laughter and affordable tasty food. Décor is great.  I think somebody told me the building used to be an old jail house?  Pretty cool."}
{"text":"I had a pretty decent meal here yesterday. I was seated right away although the place was full. I am sort of surprised that the bread they give you to munch on before the food comes wasn't better. It was just ok, and was cold. Service was spot on.... we asked our waiter to help with wines, and because we're typical chicks and the furthest thing from sommaliers, and he brought us exactly the kind of wine we wanted... fruity full and red. The main was delicious... and I thought it was the perfect serving of pasta... not too much... and probably the exact suggested serving of pasta that a nutritionist or dietician would suggest. 

The price is a little steep for what it is... $17 for pasta a la carte? But it was delicious. Good job Terroni."}
{"text":"TL;DR Spectacular Pastas and Salty but Crunchy Pizzas. Come here if you want top-grade handmade, perfectly al dente pasta; highly recommend Truffle Pasta. Ok beer selection.

I gave this place another chance because the oher brunch place I was going to go to was closed for a private event AND I had already paid parking... Boohoo. It turned out for the better though.

Upon walking in you are greeted by their vast amounts of cured meats and liquor selection. It must be great to sit down and talkup front.

Venturing further in you get to the dining hall with booths set up along the wall and in the centre. To the left you get the open kitchen where they make your pizzas. 

NOTE: Supposedly there's a 'secret' pasta factory downstairs where they make all their handmade pasta. I unfortunately did not go take the tour our lovely waitress Carmen recommended by, however the two that were with me did and commented that it was super cool.

 I highly recommend this tour and to check out all their secrets. I will surely come back one day to document it.

Let's Talk: PASTA 5/5
We ordered the Truffle Pasta and Feature Pasta (Ravioli with Prosciutto for stuffing). Both spectacular pasta dough and the sauces and the garnishes made it all the more a wonderful trip. 

I highly recommend their truffle pasta NOW vs before because their serving portion was previously shit. I think they realised they didn't put enough pasta vs before and now it is an order-able dish. Thanks for filling up my tummy this time and I look forward to the up keep in consistency.

Let's Talk: PIZZA 3/5 
It was ok. The ideas in the feature pizza was great, but too salty for my liking. We also ordered a regular Pizza on the menu that had their housemade sausage on it which was quite normal but also not to my liking for it being plain. The pizza I had the last time I came was the Smoked Salmon Pizza and my god. No. 

The pros that liked was that the dough was crispy but they probably just overstretched it this time vs the time before when the pizza seemed consideray small and wierdly doughy.

SERVICE: I've had the same waitress now and Carmen is a bundle of warmth whenever she comes. You can always depend on her whether it comes to more bread, olive oil, freshly cracked pepper or grated cheese, napkins, you name it. Tip her well and her humble service will continue!

ATMOSPHERE: Before the service really hits rock bottom (customers come in like hordes of hungry beasts around 6 pm so beware), it's a really relaxing place as I've never been post 6 pm rush. I can only imagine how ?chaotic? it might be after 6 and your Pizza consistency may be all over the place. So look for a 5 pm supper or lunch if you're looking for a tranquil time or get it all hyped up with your crew post-6!

Happy eating to future guests and thank you for having me again!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the patio was fabulous. Service was sort of ho hum. Too many servers working on our table and little communication between them. We waited for what seemed like a very long time. We were offered bread from one server, but had to ask the server who dropped off our calamari if we could have it. My pasta Puttanesca was delicious and my partner had a Gargamelli with sausage, fontina and dandelion. The dish was outstanding. 

Just too many servers doing too much stuff. I miss the old days when one server looked after your table and you could build a rapport with them, and they knew what you needed without having to have four different people make sure to communicate your needs to one another. 

I'd go back because the food is delicious, but the service model requires too much communication that does't even seem possible in such a busy environment. I don't blame the servers for this, they were very pleasant and did as good a job as any server could do under the circumstances. Everything just seemed a bit rushed an impersonal.

More like a 3.5."}
{"text":"This place is known for the pasta dishes but I wasn't very blown away with the taste. I found the pasta dishes bland and flavorless. They also refuse to make any changes to the food, which is extremely frustrating when you're paying for your meal. I've given this restaurants two tries and haven't had any luck."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the quality of the food is always good.  Both the pasta and pizzas are great.  They do a great job of cooking their pasta perfectly.  The warm bread slices and olive oil are also treat.  I really enjoyed the prosciutto + fig app if you get a chance.  Decor is neat.  It's essentially an old courthouse turned into resto.  They bathrooms are the old jail cells and they have a small patio in the back.

They have a BBQ menu in the summer.  A colleague had the lamb bbq dish and everything was overcooked.  Stick to the regular menu.  They also have some great fish/salad dishes I saw.  The halibut in particular caught my eye.  Service is OK, although the last time I had lunch there I felt it was below average."}
{"text":"What can I say? Terroni's is just full of delicious flavour exploding into your mouth.

Been there many times, always get the oyster mushroom salad, its like lightly toasted oyster mushrooms. I never really been a big fan of oyster mushrooms until I had it here.

The pizza, of course is also amazing here. Great thin crust homestyle pizza, full of juicy delicious flavour. 

Other than that, the restaurant also has a great vibe, friendly staffs, definitely a favorite in Toronto!"}
{"text":"So I finally made it to Terroni. I'm a huge fan of Italian food and since moving to Toronto,  a good seventeen years ago, I've been exploring Italian restaurants all over the city in search of some amazing pizza and chicken parmegiana. I can say that Terroni is just another restaurant that I'll add to the list of high expectations that led to somewhat of a disappointing experience. 

Anyway, I visited the location on a snowy Saturday night. The restaurant was reasonably busy for 18hs and I was informed by the hostess that I could have a table until 20hs... It made me wonder what would happen if for some reason I wasn't finished with the meal (fortunately I never found out as the bill was paid at 20hs on the clock and I was out of the restaurant one minute later) 

I read, re-read and read the menu again in a desperate attempt to find a chicken parmegiana dish... It wasn't to be so I settled for a buffalina pizza. 

The pizza came fast and while it was far from being  terrible it was also far from being delicious. The main problem was actually the dough, as I found it extremely and surprisingly difficult to cut and chew. It was definitely miles away even from the simplest pizzas found all over Europe. Not bad, not good, just meh. 

Waitress was polite and efficient. The place looks pretty awesome and the dishes are reasonably priced. 

Overall a decent experience but I can't really recommend it for a true Italian pizza experience (other than the fact that the pizza doesn't come sliced, that is)."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come to Terroni after looking at all the delicious photos of their pastas across social media. I came here on a Saturday during lunch hours, and I expected it to be busy, but the restaurant was quite empty. The restaurant itself is huge with a large number of seats, and the interior of the restaurant is rustic and a great place to take some cute photos. 

The weather was beautiful so we sat at their patio. I liked how they have huge umbrellas so your not under the blistering heat. If your coming to Terroni for the first time, you must order the Tonnarelli alla Norcina. I have no idea what kind of pasta noodles they used, but it was thick and cooked perfectly. It had minced pieces of spicy sausage which gave it a nice saltiness and flavour to the pasta. The dish itself uses a simple sauce, some sort of spicy oil I believe. Make sure you check the mirror after you eat this dish, there may be red oil around your mouth! It is on the pricy side compared to their other pastas, but I highly recommend you try this dish.

I would recommend making reservations if you're coming for dinner with a large group, and try to order their other pastas and all share. They all sound so delicious!"}
{"text":"There are many things I could say about the Teronni restaurants, but basically it all boils down to mediocre food, diners with full wallets who don't know any better, and absolutely horrible service. Here's an example- if you spot a pizza on the menu that you love the sound of except for one thing (maybe you want to take something off because you don't like it or you are allergic) they will not make this adjustment for you. Instead they'll turn up their noses and say that's how the chef intended the pizza to be eaten. Want to dip your bread in some balsamic vinegar? Too bad. That's not how the Italians do it. 
I've had the 'pleasure' of going to three of their locations in Toronto due to events, birthdays etc., and it's the same every time. Look, the food is alright, but the sour taste left in your mouth from the service will overshadow any decent flavours you try . If you like being belittled, please go here! You'll have a blast."}
{"text":"The food was pretty solid.  We both had pizza.  Ambiance on the patio was charming and nice. 
Menu was very confusing.  The appetizers we found at the end and mixed in other sections.  And called apristomaco (don't know what language that is). Even basic ingredients were labeled as complicated.  In fact almost every item had ingredients my itialian guest and I could not figure out.  Probably the worst menu I have ever seen. 

Food turned out to be hot and very good. 
Service was mediocre. And the wait time was reasonable at about 25 minutes."}
{"text":"Delicious place! I really like Italian food and this is one of the restaurants that has decent Italian food, not to mention the size portion is also huge!

I ordered a Fettuccine al Ragu De maiale, which is a special dish from a different menu. It is basically fettuccine with shredded pork cheek.  Very good el dente feel pasta. 

If you can, try to sit outside at the patio section. Sometimes the inside is a bit too crowded and the music is too loud that you can't hear conversations. One interesting fact about Terroni that it used to be a court house. It was later converted into a restaurant, therefore you'll realize that all the washrooms were jail cells in the past."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6 people. The food was good and we had a good wine to match (can't recall name, but it was supporting a social movement). However the service was terrible. Our server was condescending and rude and when we asked to speak to a manager because we had had enough, she adopted the same attitude. She took a long time to arrive at the table and was uninterested in our experience. Quite a disappointment. Will never return."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely terrific and affordable - only problem is staff could care less about service -- long line ups where you get bumped if the servers friends come in."}
{"text":"What a horrible dining experience... it took a half hour to simply order a meal and twenty minutes to receive a glass of wine. The kicker? They gave me someone else's credit card after I started a tab. I wouldn't return here as they don't seem to care about the details of a dining experience. The food itself was just okay."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I don't find the food and service consistent. It is a nice trendy place for Italian food. Atmosphere is very lively and vibrant. It's definitely a place for hipsters. I really like the decor and atmosphere. 

I find the servers kind of snooty, I don't know if they do this on purpose to make themselves posh. But sometimes we do get a nice server. Depending on where you are sitting the seats aren't always comfortable. 

I've had really good food here and sometimes just okay. I remember having a duck breast dish that was really good. This time I tried their special which was a wild boar Ragu with pappardelle pasta. I guess the problem with Ragu is that they all taste the same, which it did. The server said there was some fruits in the sauce which I didn't taste. The wild boar had a gamey taste to it and a smell which I didn't mind but my neighbor did. The pasta was good but not as good as last time. This time we ordered the puzza pizza which had Italian ham, mushroom and Gorgonzola on it. There crust was surprisingly good, not like last time, thin and crispy. The cheese and ham had a strong smell but was tasty. 

Overall pasta good last time pizza good this time. Inconsistent. Service okay. This place is always busy though. They don't allow you to make reservations during the popular times. But people are in and out pretty quick cause they are all hip and have places to be! The washrooms are so nice, must visit!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Terroni is probably the impossibly fresh chopped chillis that they serve as an accompaniment to their pizzas and pastas.  As for the pizza, it was alright.  We were about to leave the line that went out the door when we were called for an upstairs table.  We were served by a harassed waiter (probably not his fault for his I'm-cooler-than-you-attitude as he was incredibly busy).  In retrospect, it was kind of funny that I almost mangled the pizza trying to cut it with my dull dining knife as it comes whole, with a tough crust, on a slippery ceramic plate."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start, an outstanding experience.. great location and patio. 
The food was exceptional.. we were there for a staff lunch of 10 people and everyone was happy with their dish.. the quantities justify the slightly more expensive prices and the server was superb..
I will definitely come back and encourage everyone to try it!"}
{"text":"This ambiance of place is hard to categorize. The building has a modern exterior, while the three floor restaurant is a mix of wood, leather banquets, 60s basket chairs, teak and leather upright chairs, country cloth napkins.... You get my point. It was disjointed. The same could be said of the clientele: young families with screaming toddlers, young hipster groups of guys and girls, first dates, date night, bar crowd. Speaking of crowds, was it ever! Not a table free at 6:30 on a Sunday.

However, it's rare that I go to a restaurant and after a quick glance at the menu not know what to order. Usually that's because nothing appeals to me. In this case everything on the menu was described deliciously and I wanted it all! Here's what we went with:

Apps: Fiddleheads (daily special), Tagliere di Formaggio, Frittura di Calamari. Fiddleheads were fresh and cooked perfectly but nothing really extraordinary. Cheese tray seemed skimpy for the price ($19) and it would have benefited from the house bread rather than the thin toasted baguette slices that came with it. The calamari had a lovely light tempura batter. It does not come with sauce, only lemon slices.

Mains: pappardelle alla iosa , rigatoni arcobalena, spaghetti al limone. Decent portions. Pasta cooked nicely. The rigatoni had the equivalent toppings to a Margherita pizza. I was looking for a lighter pasta and it satisfied. The zucchini added to the mix had a nice crunch to it. Others at the table similarly enjoyed their pastas.

Dessert: this might be the reason to go here. No dessert menu online. Ordered the croissant with gelato and whipped cream, butterscotch pudding with salted caramel sauce and Bombe (doughnut) with custard filling. Croissant big enough to share. Nice pastry and interesting combination. The pudding is for 1. And you won't want to share. The caramel was the perfect amount of bitter and the salty notes were heaven. The doughnut was large, hot, creamy, dreamy.

So overall Terroni delivers a solid rustic Italian food experience despite its confused identity."}
{"text":"After having dined here a couple of times already, I decided it was time for a proper review. 

Food: 3 stars

I actually like their salads and love their butterscotch pudding, however, I had the worst beef tartar I have probably ever eaten which was disappointing. It was crusted in a thick coating of black pepper and accompanied by the thickest dijon dressing on my arugula that left me aghast. The meat did not taste fresh at all. The carpaccio di manzo was also nothing to write home about, as well as the frittura di calamari. Bland. 

Ambiance/general aesthetic: 4 stars 

Beautifully decorated. Popping patio in the summer.  Don't expect a romantic candle-lit dinner; this place gets loud. Familial group gatherings, Rosedale housewives and budding fashionistas galore. 

Service: 4 stars 

Perhaps that might differ if you are dining downstairs vs. patio. No complaints on my part. No reservations, but you probably won't end up waiting long for a table unless you're in a big group."}
{"text":"Not that it wasn't great, it was. I just can't help but compare to my 1st Terroni - Queen St W. The decor here is more modern, there is less wait time, and the food is equally comparable to a degree of somewhat, and the water glass are even branded with the Terroni name which is a nice personal touch. But, just not the same...... I enjoy eating my Tomato Mozzarella Salad out of a wooden bowl, not from a plain white plate. The pasta with sausage+mushroom was tasty and delicious, but for some reason just lacking a bit of uniqueness I usually get from Terroni Queen W.   Great place and would still recommend it, but just not the same...."}
{"text":"I have been to Terroni Adelaide many times and every dining experience has been great. It is definitely a preferred spot and I often recommend it to people. I love the décor/ambience and what they've done with this old courthouse. True, who cares about décor if the food and service don't deliver.  Whether I've had pasta or an entrée (there is usually something appealing on the Specials menu), my meal has never been a disappointment and the same goes for my dining companions. I have enjoyed any wine and the desserts are great.  I read some of the recent reviews and the comments on bad service and food quality really surprise me. I've never had bad service or food issues here (it's true they don't do substitutions but I'm over it and understand the authenticity angle). I don't care that the wait staff are dressed casually; it goes with the vibe of the place. I don't find them pretentious and they are always attentive but never overbearing. They check-in to see if you are satisfied with your food and ask if you need anything else, with good timing and without being overbearing. Another simple meter is that they always make sure you have enough water; even when your carafe is low they replenish it without being intrusive. I hate being in a restaurant where the customers have try to flag down their waiter for any reason, or to constantly ask for more water. It does get very busy so don't expect to be seated immediately if you just walk in. If you have definite plans, make a reservation. They have a cool bar area at the front and you will find that busy too. Downstairs there is a large room for more private functions. Upstairs it's also common to see large groups (e.g. birthday or anniversary celebration) and that always seems to go well. It's a very family friendly place, albeit pricey as it all adds up. Being so busy, it does get noisy but you can still have a conversation. (I'll try to remember to update this review should I end up having a negative experience in the future.)"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now and honestly, it could be a million times better. 

The tables are so close together that I feel like I'm have a conversation with my table neighbour. The last time I was there with my husband we barely said two words to each other during the entire meal because the tables on each side of us were deep in conversation. I know the life story of both couples now! I've had this experience downstairs and upstairs as well. 

On all occasions the hostesses are lovely and take their job seriously. They are well organized and are always smiling. The servers on the other hand are not so awesome. On more than one occasion the server looked annoyed with my friends and I because 1.) we asked for recommendations and then 2.) asked for a little more time. This beats another experience where no one even came to our table for 20min. I'm not joking, we timed it, 20min just for the server to come over and take our drink order. 

We wait what feels like years for drink refills and to have our order taken. The food takes almost as long. 

The food is good though. I've gotten the cheese board which I love and the crispy calamari which is also delicious. The warm mushroom salad came highly recommended and it was a good choice as well. I always get the same pizza - walnut, pear and gorgonzola. That flavour combination is awesome and is hands down, one of my most favourite pizzas ever. The chili pepper oil they give you for the pizza is amazing. I had to ask for a second bowl last time. I would put that on everything if I could. 

One thing I really dislike, WHY DON'T YOU CUT YOUR PIZZA?! Honestly I feel like I'm going to knock everything off the table as I try to cut the pizza into slices. It drives me bonkers. Just cut the pizza for your customers. They're paying enough for it!

The location is nice, the ambiance is great too. Love that there's a DJ all night long. 

Will I come back? Possibly, but it would have to be because I was in the area. Between eating almost on top of my table neighbour and the garbage service, there's many other places in the city I can choose to get good pizza."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very special decoration. However it was way too busy and noised. You better make reservation in advance. The pasta is good but not great! I have better Italian food . However their home made spicy sauce was very impressed and special. 
Please also note that the restaurant are not very flexible since they are not willing the switch the types of the pasta in the menu items. :("}
{"text":"Terroni deserves its high ratings and ubiquity in this city (I also hear they opened up an LA location). It's not exactly revolutionary or exotic food, but that's not what you come to Terronis for; you come for casual and rustic Italian dishes and the bright and lively atmosphere. 

I have been going to the Queen location for years and have been to the Adelaide location a handful of times because I work nearby. Both locations are bright, busy and serve tasty (though not amazing) food. I find the service to be good most of the time despite how busy it is. The Adelaide location feels \"fancier\" because it used to be a courthouse. The ceilings are high and the general vibe is a bit trendier and more upscale than the more chalkboard, jars and knickknack feeling of the Queen location. 

Call me a narcissistic but I used to frequently get the Natalina pizza. The Queen location has a nice big patio which is always a bonus. One last random tidbit is that they do not serve diet soda, balsamic vinegar or caesar cocktails."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that there is a Terroni's uptown. I no longer need to venture downtown or way east to get myself a yummy oven baked pizza.

I ordered the Puzza, which is a white pizza with mozzarella, mascarapone, gorgonzola, mushrooms, and italian ham. As a cheese-lover, this pizza was absolute cheese heaven. There was the balance between the mozzarella and the sweet mascarapone and pungent gorgonzola. Mmmmmmmm. One little downside was that both the Puzza and the Napoli were quite salty. I guess it's hard to cut down on the salt with so much cheese and ham!

Will be trying their pastas next time."}
{"text":"I've had much better food at other places. This restaurant just isn't worth the hype nor the high prices. 

It's an OK place to take a date, but again there are more authentic places for Italian food than Terroni. The waitstaff wear grungy clothing which doesn't really add to the 'high end' appeal they are trying to achieve. Our waitress had her 3 day old unwashed hair tied up into a ragged bun. Gross!

Plus my pasta was not cooked long enough, and my fiance's pizza was overpriced. 

Not worth it."}
{"text":"We're back on the HUNT for Toronto's BEST! Stop #3 of the pizza pie tour: Terroni

On a hot summer afternoon we made the trek up Yonge Street to a restaurant that I've heard plenty of great things about. By the time I made my way in, I recognized why. Terroni has beautifully casual interior design, giving you just about as much as you could ask for in terms of a cool, definitely not fancy, restaurant environment. You'll be able to enjoy its three or four (don't quite remember) floors, and be able to bring just a friend, or the whole crew. I can't speak to the other two locations, but this one sets the standard.

I flipped the script this time around and ordered a white pizza; the Bomba. It was their daily special, and I trusted the enthusiasm of our strapping waiter. Since this pie isn't on their regular menu, I can't tell you every ingredient on it with certainty, but I can say that you'll get plenty of white button or crimini mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, mozzarella, (possibly) chorizo, and two cooked eggs. Their pizzas all start with very thin crusts, and they're served uncut. I mean nothing overtly negative about this, but despite its name, the Bomba is no bomb. It's a solid white pizza that doesn't leave you wanting marinara sauce, and everything on it was appetizing. It was just far from an A+ bomb and more like a ... B+ firework. I will say though that I was intrigued by the two eggs on the pie, that aren't 100% cooked. I personally love my yolk uncooked, but hey, maybe you're on team no-yolk, in which case this would turn you off.

Aside from that, I also tried the Focu Meu, which I'd describe simply as pizza reminiscent of the classiest Chef Boyardee that I've ever had. My childhood was warmed.

All in all, Terroni is a fantastic establishment, with OK pizza. I've heard that they have amazing pasta, but we'll leave that for next time. Come to Terroni to chill out friends, but not for the best pizza around."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for work and this was recommended.  It is a really neat environment and the food was great.  Service was really great too.  I had the gnocchi which was awesome, the meat and cheese tray for an appetizer and the molten chocolate cake.  All were so yummy!  \"}
{"text":"Looking at the place I was impressed, reading the right ups I thought it'd be good, on arrival I realised it was to be a nightmare! The lighting is poor, the noise sounds like a kids classroom, the menu is indecipherable and the service was rushed! The main course was cooked too quickly so they just tried to take our half eaten starters away..! The food was pretty good and the price wasn't bad but..."}
{"text":"this is a really great restaurant.  I've tried a bunch of their pizzas and they r all REALLy good.  thin crust, all delicious.  But the dish i think about randomly is their Ravioli di Zio Paperone -homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano. MELT. in. your. mouth goodness! actually SO good but the portion is a bittt small for my liking.  I'm always down to come here."}
{"text":"I just ate there for my birthday dinner with friends and I have to say it was one of the best meals I have ever had. We ordered my favourites (Fungi Salad, Carpaccio, San Giorgio Pizza) and ordered a great Monkfish special, and two fantastic pasta specials, one with Truffles that blew our minds. We ordered one for dessert! Terroni, you know I love you!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a lively atmosphere. We take our young kids to an early seating and they love it. Funghi Assoluti is wicked awesome."}
{"text":"After my friend suggested checking out Terroni's I'm so glad that I did.

Their pizza is great. I like the pizza dough, which was thin and had great texture. Soft and doughy, with just the right amount of crispiness. The pizza is pretty big so it's easily split between 2 people. I also had their truffle pasta special. It was a little too al dente for me. But the flavor of the sausage paired with the earthy flavour of the truffle worked really well. 

My only complaint is that the tables are way too close to each other. There is barely enough room for one person to get by. But the decor of the place is cool and it was pretty busy for a Wed evening. So I suggest if you are going during the dinner rush hour get a reservation. I was too full to try out their dessert, but hopefully next time.

It's a great place if you are looking for Italian food in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Italian small plate restaurant. Food is pretty good - fried calamari, mixed green salad, gnocchi, seafood pasta, panna cotta dessert. Why I'm giving it 2 stars is... Service was so-so. It was hard to hail a waitress since we were put in the dark corner in the front lobby area (yes, and I made reservations). Not going back if I'm ever in Toronto."}
{"text":"The restaurant is housed in what once was an old courthouse, so the facility is actually huge. There is a shop where you can buy groceries and accessories, an event space, and the restaurant which spans 4 different levels! This seems to make for very differing reviews form others, but I'm here to tell you about my experience.
We stopped by just before Valentines Day, so the placed was jammed. Fortunately, the place is so large we were able to get a table without a reservation. Service was attentive and friendly. The wine list is comprehensive with an excellent selection of Italian wines so you have lots to choose from. We started with the Calamari all Griglia - grilled squid - and the Purpietello - sauteed octopus. Both were superb, not overcooked, wonderfully flavoured, just so delicious with a glass of Prosecco! For the mains we had the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese - housemade pasta with meat sauce - and the special of the day - mixed grill. The mixed grill was very good. Some lamb, sausage and skewered beef properly cooked, tender and very good. But the star of the show was the tagliatelle, and in particular, the sauce. Those who have had a real Bolognese sauce know that it takes plenty of effort and time to create that richness and melt in your mouth flavours, while not being greasy, heavy or filled with fillers or substitutes. This sauce is the real deal. Just dunk me into a vat of this and leave me alone for a week.
After the red wine and all that food, I didn't have room for dessert, but there will definitely be a next time, so maybe then?"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and Terroni did not dissapoint. The spaghetti in canna mare was divine.  It's almost as if the pasta was soaked or cooked in a seafood broth and then covered with seafood and tomato sauce goodness. The portion was also great as we ended up taking it home, and me oh my was it just as good the next day. The grilled calamari was perfectly seasoned, and almost melts in your melt at each bite. Our waitress was a sweetheart, and recommended some great white wines to compliment with the seafood we ate (wish I just remembered which it was lol). Can't wait to go back again to try the other dishes. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It isn't amazing and it isn't terrible.  Each time I've come here my food has been good.  BUT, it seems like around every bend there is a stop sign.  They don't have Diet Coke.  I don't even drink it, but someone I was with was super disappointed....because they had regular Coke.  Then my friend asked for a particular pizza without the olives....but just a heads up, they don't do ANY alterations to their menu (i.e. not putting olives on a 4 topping pizza).  And a grilled panini?  Just another FYI: it is a sandwich.  Pressing it does not mean it is a panini.  

What is the deal?  Things like that are so minimal.  They pressed the panini in the end but you're a restaurant.  If I wanted lip about how I like my food, I'd go home to my parents' house.  There are not huge, out of control requests.  I also heard from a friend that they got scolded for asking for parm to add to their dish (although this could be hearsay).

The food is good but not amazing, the service not so much and there are other better Italian restaurants for the same price with less BS.  And if you just have to have Terroni?  Go to Adelaide."}
{"text":"Disastrous take out and pretty unapologetic about it. Very busy place -- lots of moving parts so unlikely that any one part will receive any serious attention or consideration. Toronto is a resto town but easy to get caught up in neighborhood regular spots -- not Worb getting complacent!"}
{"text":"Massive restaurant and charming space.

Service: like others, can be a bit shoddy.  The hostess sat the two of use promptly directly under a skylight at noon.  The sun was uncomfortable and I asked to be moved to a shadier table and she made a comment that could be interpreted as snarky- something about how the sun always moves or shit.  But whatever.  
They offered a couple other table options and we were agreeable to both, but we waited for them to direct us to one of the two options.  they didn't.  Instead the hostess commented on moving us to one table and the waitress to another table.  we continued to wait until there was a difinitive \"tell- me-which-table-to-move-to\"

Then the waitress came back and was like, \"uhh... do you want to move to that table?\"  And I kindly acted like it was MY mistake that I hadn't already moved and said, \"oh, we weren't aware that the other table was set up- of course\" [moving with a smile].

Whatever.

Once we were seated it took a VERY long time for a server to come.  This was a bit annoying as they had taken away our menus from the last table and weren't given menus at the new table.  So the new server was confused and asked us uncofmortably, \"uhh..did you seat yourselves?\"
We explained the misup and she gladly went to get us menus.

Once that fiasco was done with everything was a-ok.

Food:

Both of us asked the server to reccommend something and the server seemed very knowledgable and off-hand reccommended two dishes we were already eyeing: the natalina pizza and the duck mushroom ravioli.

The dishes came and both were spot on.  they weren't AMAZING.  I wasn't sitting there wondering where Terroni had been all my life, but I was far from disappointed either.  
the garlicky pizza on the thin crust was lovely.  And although I'm still not a \"thin crust\" pizza kinda girl, it was still very satisfying.  My dining partner said the same about the pasta.

The serving sizes dont' look like much, but food is rich and it is surprisgin how filling it is.
In fact I could only finish half my pizza there -but did delve into the leftovers almost immediately when I got home = P

If not b/c of time I would have ordered the \"to di for\" choc lava cake that everyone on this board raves about.

But it is likely I'll be back, if only for the cake and espresso- 

post-cafe
had a double long espresso and they did it perfectly.  espresso was nice and strong but sweet with nice crema.  no milk or sugar necessary, which is a good sign that they have excellent espresso.

Star rating:
Perhaps I would have given it a 4/5 if the initial confusion didn't happen.  Or if people didn't RAVE about this place being the best restaurant in the city.  Or even perhaps if I liked italian food more (not even in my top 5 of cuisines).  but all in all a good place that I would consider on my regulars list.

Price:
at 15$ dish average I wouldnt' even say this place is expensive or a pricey indulgence.  But it's not one of those places you'll go a couple times or week or even once a week.

next up I'll try the Queen west location to see if there's a difference in service, as many seem to think there is."}
{"text":"I visited the one on queen twice, both times i had a good experience there with the food and drink. the only thing that did kind of bother me is that they do not accept or tolerate any changes to the plate they serve, so you cant ask for more of this or less of that. you get what they serve and that's it. Don't get me wrong, i loved the place and the food but sometimes you might have some special request and the restaurant should be more flexible in accommodating customers requests. Other than this the portions were great, variety was good and i just fell in love with their cheese variety. i intend on going the next time and just order a mix of cheese and Italian cured meats. Also worth mentioning that i loved the fact that you can do online reservation without any worries and it is pretty accurate with availability.
Love the place and the environment"}
{"text":"The 6 of us went to Terroni for a birthday dinner. Everything was great until we got our main course dishes then the service took a turn for the worst when we asked for parmesan cheese for our various pasta dishes. The waiter simply refused to provide any parmesan whether grated over pasta or on the side stating that it was against Terroni's policy to serve parmesan with the seafood pasta then took his cheese and disappeared on us. This ridiculous cheese policy coupled with the waiter's demeanour has prompted me to sign up for yelp in order to write my first and only review. I normally don't care about mishaps during service and always tip generously because i come from this industry but what happened here was out of line. 

My guests and i have dined numerous times at Terroni's at its many locations both in Toronto and Los Angeles, that will not only stop going forward but we'll also stop recommending the brand altogether to our guests, family and friends.
One advice, \"Bring your own grated Parmesan\" if you're the type that enjoys cheese with your seafood pasta."}
{"text":"Love the slice it yourself pizza idea. Excellent use of ingredients and lots of respect for their no substitutions policy. Shows a lot of confidence in their menu and it delivered. If you have never had a burrata you are in for a treat, soft cheese wrapped in chewy cheese. Pasta was simple and spot on. Fabulous wine list. The jail cells down stairs add a touch of nostalgia."}
{"text":"Still till this day my fave spot to grab Italian food. I went here with my fam and ordered the seafood pasta, gnocchi tomatoes pasta, pear and white sauce prosciutto pizza as well as the tomato sauce one. Delicious! All the pastas are done in house so the aldante texture is surely there. The sauce is flavorful and thick not watery at all.

 I have had the pear pizza before so I knew I had to get it since it was so good. The caramelized pear thinly sliced on the pizza gives it that sugary and honey flavor. I highly recommend that pizza! It's not your everyday pizza. If you are a fan of things pizza you will surely love it.

The service as usual was excellent! Friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I know I am very picky about pizza and admit it.  I need it to be thin crusted, bubbly, and the cheese has to be top-notch.  If the setting is rustic and homey, that's a plus.  This place did the trick.  I had a great lunch here with friends I hadn't seen in years.  When you move to NYC and only visit Toronto twice a year, it's hard to keep in touch with everyone.  

Pizzas are huge, and every combination looked good on the menu.  The one I ordered was a special, with parmesan, sausage, truffle oil, mushrooms.  I am craving it now a few days later.  My hubby had a nice squash ravioli, my friend, the calamari salad that she enjoyed.  

I had visited the location on Queen West several years ago and remember liking that experience as well.  For a chain, I must say that I find this one more reliable (and tolerable!) than most."}
{"text":"Wasn't the way I had remembered. Hadn't been here for a while and this time the quality was not what I was hoping for. The seafood pasta was a bit bland and very little seafood. Even had a shell with nothing in it. Not worth another return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had high expectations so perhaps that is why I was disappointed. It has a lovely space, and well decorated and clean. But the service was terrible, took inordinately long to take our orders, as well as come back around so we could get the bill. A drink order got forgotten, and the server was never around for us to remind her. I'm patient, but we were not looked after. 

I ordered the ravioli, with fig, oyster and mushrooms and thought it was disappointing. It was not as good as I expected, entirely uninteresting presentation. I could not taste fig or oyster. To be fair, I tried a bite of someone's pizza and that was amazing, but my experience was sub-par. Expensive, and not worth it."}
{"text":"This is the place to be. The courthouse makes an amazing setting for a restaurant. There are little off-shoots of rooms that are perfect for larger groups, and the whole place feels like an art gallery. If you go use the restroom in the basement they use old jail cells for wine storage and there is a private room for parties. Everyone that works there is passionate about the food and the space. I highly recommend their home made pasta and the margarita pizza. Soo delicious and great for sharing. They also have house made gelato as you walk in the door. My kind of place."}
{"text":"Delicious pasta that I could eat!!!
Having a gluten sensitivity, I typically cannot enjoy a nice no gluten free pasta dish. However, since Italian flour was used, I was in luck! 
Came here on a Sunday evening and enjoyed the patio and a great meal. I ordered the spinach tortellini stuffed with ricotta. It was superb! My company had the porchetta ravioli that was cooked perfectly. 

Service was excellent as well. Check this place out of you're looking for an authentic flavourful Italian meal and overalls great atmosphere and patio."}
{"text":"Terroni is by far one of my top 10 in toronto! 

If you are looking for delicious Italian food thats consistently fantastic then this is your spot. 

I used to think the best pasta was the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese its super delicious and is comprised of traditional bolognese ragù, parmigiano, I was in love with it and had to limit myself to once a month for fear of becoming a blimp. 

But them my wife introduced me to their Canna a Mare
its become my fave, here is the breakdown its Spaghetti in fresh clams and mussels, with calamari, scallops and tiger shrimp, in a light tomato sauce to highlight the delicate flavors of the shellfish \"following ancient italian tradition\". 

Add Terroni Sauce (yup I coined that) its their spicy chili sauce, add that to any of their pastas or pizzas and it instantly goes from great to spectacular. 

I cannot count the number of times I've been to Terroni, if I'm taking people put we go to the one on adalade, if its just us day time we do the patio on Queen, and we use queen to do our togo orders. 

they also have a kids pasta which Chearlee loves!"}
{"text":"They may not allow you to change things on the menu but the food is fantastic. 

The calamari appetizer Frittura di Calamari
deep fried lightly floured calamari
16.95 is amazing!  It's light and fluffy, add a lemon and it's good to go! 


If you are a seafood fan you have to try the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare
fresh clams and mussels, calamari, scallops and tiger shrimp, light tomato sauce (this pasta is not served with parmigiano to highlight the delicate flavours of the shellfish; following ancient italian tradition) with the chile sauce and you have to order extra everything (for some reason they don't give a lot of seafood or sauce) but this dish is heaven! 

Desert is flower less chocolate cake and an Terroni blend tea. 


Again this is one of the best Itallian restaurants in toronto! 

Highly recommend this place either on queen or Adelaide."}
{"text":"I love the space and the vibe. I hate feeling cramped in restaurants and so this new location is SO much better. The food is just a delicious as I would expect and enjoyed the calamari and the seafood pasta. Pizza was a bit soggy and a bit too salty (from the them ham) BUT I was most unhappy with the very disinterest waitress that seemed overall very miserable and really was not attentive. We had to ask for water and also the bread, and also we had to flag her down after we were done to let her know we would like to see the dessert menu. I would expect these things to come automatically if the waitress showed interest in her job. 

What really bothered me was when it was time to settle the bill I asked her if she could break my $100 bill into smaller bills and she looked at me as if I was an alien from outer space. Then she asked me to repeat myself to \"explain\" what it was that I wanted....then after I did she tells me \"we can't do that, we only have small bills\" Are you frickin SERIOUS a busy restaurant making $1000/hour didn't have few twenties to break up my bill. I have never felt so awkward asking for something so simple. I hope this girl quits as its obvious that she is not cut out to be a waitress."}
{"text":"This place is quite a scene.  The food is fine.  The service is better than at most Toronto restaurants.  The selection of wines is very good.  Its clientele is a mix of quality and those who want to dine with quality, and perhaps that's what makes Terroni Terroni.  I'm not opposed to going here, but I can't help but feel that it never lives up to its own hype."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my parents out to eat, heard great things about Terroni so decided to take them here.

The ambiance, the decor, and the service was fantastic. 

It was a bit difficult to order at first because the name of each item was in Italian. The description and ingredients were in English though. However, this caused some difficulties when ordering, especially for my parents who haven't eaten Italian cuisine much.

We all ended up ordering pastas, none of us expecting what exactly we were going to get. 

Bread quickly came out after we ordered. The bread was fantastic. I just thought it was a bit weird that they brought exactly three pieces, one for each of us.


I ordered the zucca which was your typical butternut squash ravioli. I thought it was pretty good. My dad ordered the Rigatoni alla Norma which I thought was my favourite. I could really taste the quality of each single pasta, and the sauce was fantastic. My mom ordered the Spaghetti al Limone At first we got a bit nervous because it looked extremely small portion. However each pasta was filled with cheese which made it dense. In the end, we each enjoyed our pasta.

We ended off our meal with a dessert. It was a croissant filled with Nutella, gelato, and whip cream. My mom absolutely loved it... I just wanted a bit more chocolate :p"}
{"text":"My family and my mums friend we went there for lunch.the food was great. Me and my sister wanted to share the bolognese and the gnocchi but my sister didn't want tomato sauce on the gnocchi so we asked the server if we could get it on the side but it wasn't possible.

Bolognese: it was good, the meat sauce was great. Big portion for a little girl.

Gnocchi: it was amazing I would definitely have that again. The tomato sauce was nice but the gnocchi in there was scrumptious. It's topped off with some good ricotta.

Barrata: it's a cheese kind of like boccocini it comes with toasted bread and tomatoes and basil it was a great appetizer.

Bresaola: it was amazing... It had the perfect amount of salt and Parmesan cheese little bit of capers and it comes with a lemon. 

NO SUBSTITUTIONS  other than  that  it was pretty good.
Casual, nice price.
I would prefer going to gusto 101"}
{"text":"Some of my favorite italian in the city. I go for the Fried Kalamari and Tonarelli with Truffle pasta. Unlike a lot of higher end italian in the city the portions are actually generous so I don't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"I love the location, the old courthouse is amazing. There is always a little bit of a wait but the food is definitely worth it. The pizza is definitely fresh and well cooked. I had something called li pecuri pizza- amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing. It was my fitst experience in Terroni. It was a stunning place, the interior design is very interesting, in a regular week night it was packed xo you better make a reservation.

They have selection of Pizzas, Pastas, drinks etc. I am not sure how southern itallian the options are but I loved, pizzas. We ordered the pasta with truffle, it was fantastic and I ordered 3 meat special which was sausage and steaks and grilled veg. We had Hazlenut and chocolate gelato which was good too. Only 4 choices though.

Usually for two people it becomes 100$, but you will nerver forget the date night that you went to Terroni."}
{"text":"So far, best pizza I've had in Toronto and very authentic. While on the expensive side,($14.95 for basil, mozzarella and pepperoni) I'd still come back to try other versions of this.  

A family friend in northern Italy makes pizzas in his outdoor pizza oven that are the best I've ever tasted.  While the pizza I had here today wasn't as good as that, it was surprisingly close!

The staff were friendly and welcoming and we didn't experience any of the negative stuff I'm seeing in the reviews here.  Susan suggested that may have been due to the fact that it was lunch and not dinner."}
{"text":"Best pizza and I love the salad !!!

It's an exciting busy bustling but wonderful atmosphere.

I have been there a few times with friends and would recommend it anytime!"}
{"text":"I ordered a margherita pizza - probably about 12 inch diameter. It wasn't cut into slices. So I asked the waitress about it - thinking that maybe this was an oversight and she said \"Oh we don't cut the pizza because we serve it whole like that. You can use your knife to cut it yourself.\" This is one of the most ridiculous things I've heard this week and I've heard some ridiculous things lately. Terroni you deserve to FAIL. The only reason I don't fail them is because the pizza tasted ok."}
{"text":"Don't confuse this location with Terroni Di Bar Centrale (http://terronicentrale.com/) a connected, but different resto all together. Not sure why they have to confuse everyone. 

If you're looking for the Terroni's near St. Clair, it's THIS ONE, and it's no where near St. Clair, even though this is what Google shows you. 
This is actually 3 streets south of Summerhill, at Price and Yonge Street. 
(I was a little annoyed when I called the Resto, and he told me this - where the hell is Price Street!)
It's hidden on Price Street, next to Bar Central Terroni, a different restaurant. 

I love the decor here. There was great attention to detail and with 2 levels, it makes for a different feel. There is a rooftop, I wonder if they have seating there during the summer. It's a rustic feel, and yet feels sophisticated and homely at the same time. 

With our large group, we were seated upstairs in a semi private room with a dedicated server. He was there basically the whole time, and you'd think he would do a better job.

I asked for separate bills, but I was told by my friend who organized that it was their \"policy\" that they don't do this. I understand it's difficult, but it would be nice that they can be flexible. I did ask them to do it by tables (we had 18 people!). 

We got bread (that wasn't fully sliced), and I asked for balsamic vinegar. The answer was \"We don't do that. But the olive oil and peppers (points) are really good\". Um thanks. 

When we finally got our food, it did come in a timely manner, but he did not come around with cheese or ground pepper. When I asked, he came and gave it to me, but didn't ask anyone else. A little weird. 

Although our water was always filled (small carafes on the side of the table), it was strange that when friends on the next table asked for more water, he just gave them a half full carafe from our table. Same for dessert menus, just gave them ours. 

Food wise, it was mediocre at best. There are much better places in Toronto that serve better tasting Italian food and pasta. It was bland and not flavourful, and some were not unique. Their price point is too high for this. 

The menu has lots of choice, but is not very diverse. No substitutions so you know basically it's cooked in a giant pot and probably at the beginning of the evening. They also do not have Gluten Free pasta as a choice - if you're looking for this, head up to St. Clair at the Il Fornello - better tasting too). 

I got the Parpadelle pasta with mushrooms, shaved percornio and spicy sausage in olive oil. ($17.95) I really felt that it was so bland, that I had to add peppers to it. I had a total of 3 small mushrooms, and the teeniest bits of ground sausage. It was also quite dry. 
There was another simliar item on the menu, Garganelli, same ingredients but no mushroom and another type of cheese, it was better tasting, but simliar to the macaroni my mom used to make at home. 

AT had a ground lamb pasta ($17.95)- it wasn't terrible, but if you replaced with ground meat, i would not have known. 

One of the better tasting one was a spinach ravioli with duck confit in it. (in general, I'm skeptical of ravioli because you can never tell exactly what's in it)

Dessert was not bad ($8). The tiramisu was hard to mess up and the simplest to serve in bulk. It was coffee soaked biscuits served with the tasty cream on top in a bowl. 

I was asked how I would rate it. For a 3 star, I would say I'd actually come back here if In the area, but honestly, i would skip it. Maybe a coffee or lunch. 
I probably would veto other Terroni locations, I've been to a few and never was too impressed. 

Free parking one street south.

Because we were such a big group, gratuity was added (15%) but on the total including the taxes. (see photo). This is so wrong.

----
Note: Maybe I'm being too subjective, but Charlotte W was with me, and she loves the place. I encourage you to read her review and try for yourself if you're skeptical!"}
{"text":"This place is good. I enjoy the pizza quite a bit.

They have a lovely patio with the names of Italian wines written on the walls. Just be sure to beat the lunch rush."}
{"text":"After hearing amazing things about this place I was not fully wowed- that's hard for me to even say just because I have been a manager in the industry for a long time now and usually can look past the small stuff... our server was not really attentive- a party of 12 should never be taken by 1 person who also has 4 other large parties going on all at once. The food is good, the drinks were okay. Was very disappointed we were there celebrating a special occasion and not even a manager came by to say anything nor did the server - and they all knew it was for a surprise 30th... always take the time to thank your guests for choosing your spot as a destination in this industry! Maybe I'll try again?..."}
{"text":"We ordered a white pizza and a saucy tomato pizza for flavour.  The Al Salmone was a white pizza with in-house smoked salmon, Italian cream, mozzarella, capers, red onions, and fresh tomatoes.  The Smendozzata had tomato, mozzarella, homemade spicy sausage, gorgonzola, and red onions on it.

Both pizzas had a very thin crust and were largely portioned!  I was so excited to try it.

The smoked salmon on the Al Salmone wasn't evenly distributed so sometimes when cutting up the pizza, you might get a slice that didn't have any smoked salmon on it.  Otherwise, I liked the freshness of the smoked salmon and thought it was really high quality.  If I were to ever eat another smoked salmon pizza that was this good, I think I would be fine with it, haha."}
{"text":"I am aware that I might have given out too many four stars. 

I definitely like this place better than a 3 star but  I am not a fan of it.

Although I did celebrate Chinese New Year there lol and got drunk ......

The food is very good. ( Please bare me that I can't recall the Italian name so have to describe it) Love the mushroom salad appetizer. and LOVE the Tiramisu. Actually I consider it as the best Tiramisu I ever had.

I had the grilled fish once too. Very tender and fresh.

I am not a great great fan of the tradition style pasta ( Why you are going to a Italian Restaurant then? You might ask, but ... sorry?)

So that all the pasta choice I had was not very attractive .
Plus the price is tend to be the expensive side.   

But~ Good place to check out"}
{"text":"Terroni is a really a mixed bag when it comes to service and food. And frankly, it's more often than not erring on the mediocre side of things. The wait depending on the night can vary between brisk to outright mental competing against the crowds on Queen West. 

And for what really? Well, Terroni's operates like a brisk and at times brusque! commercial operation, ushering diners in and out quickly, no substitutions or reservations thank you but come on down anyways and have our middle of the road fare. Not unlike a finer east side mario's with their requisite fine ingredients on the menu and the quirky decor of fellini posters and modern italian adverts. 

Their cheese and meat boards are beautiful and vary regularly in terms of selection. One night I sampled a beautiful assortment of pingue proscuitto, breadsticks, foccacia fingers, nuts, cheese, honey and a poached pear-outstanding. Their pizza's are terrifically thin crust, a crisp cracker consistency that manages to be among the best thin crust pizza's in town even with Libretto now in the mix. Although I do think that Terroni's is slightly better because it isn't as soggy as PL's . And the atmosphere here and on Adelaide is lively and boisterous making this a nice to place to share food with friends. For tiramisu lovers-Terroni's version is top notch, there's plenty of marscarapone but not too much so that the lady fingers are crushed or crumbling into tatters as is often the case at other places.

However that being said, there's always a few irks at Terroni that limit me to only a few visits a year. The service though usually efficient and pleasant enough may come only after 20 minutes have passed by before you're noticed. Or several requests for fresh pepper go unanswered. And the pasta is not their strong suit, what I've had has come across as pastey, doughy or gummy. Not something you'd want to wrangle your choppers through when you can achieve a better result at home! Accompanying sauces though simple verge on blandness in some dishes.

All that being said, I will still come here once in awhile to sample what's among the best of Toronto's pizza's."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere but they refused to give us balsamic vinegar to go with our bread for some strange reason. Very strange. Service was pretty bad overall"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I've visited Terroni several times in the past year. Authentic Italian food and arguably the best Pasta in town. However, the service is very inconsistent. On a couple of occasions, our severs were rude, arrogant, and impersonal. For example, my mum accidentally knocked her glass of water. She profusely apologized to our waitress. In return? Get's a skinny napkin thrown at her and reprimanded: \"not my problem, you can clean it up.\" LOL, seriously? Last Sunday, my pint arrived after our appetizers were cleared and mains were served, despite politely reminding them once. These things wouldn't matter if I was at McDonalds, but I'm spending $50++ on a dinner here. On a brighter note, the ambiance is electic and fun!"}
{"text":"Yup. Do it. Terroni is delish. I've been to two of their locations and have left satisfied every time. Their pizzas are a delight, thin crusts with a variety of toppings. I have also been tempted on occasion to trade my soul for a helping of their gnocchi. 

As with most things in Toronto, overpriced, but delicious and service is decent."}
{"text":"Great, delicious and always consistent food.  Priced just right, with a great wine selection with most bottles that can't be found at the LCBO.  Service is usually very helpful with selecting daily menu specials and wines/liquors."}
{"text":"It's good pasta but not great pasta...

Pasta is always one that's tough to please the masses.  Everyone thinks they can do it better themselves at home.  And traditional Italian pasta is very simple and flavourful... So, in North America, great Italian places are few, far and in between.

I had the LINGUINE AL FRUTTI DI MARE.  Aka Seafood pasta.  This is one of my favs in Italy, but fresh pasta is a must.  They didn't go too bad, it was an enjoyable dish with Scallops, Mussels, Calamari, and Shrimp... in tomato sauce, which was good.  I felt like it needed a bit of fresh basil...

The other parties had the PAPPARDELLE ALLA IOSA, which was flavorful - you can taste the saltiness of the sausage and the flavour was unique - I would recommend this dish if you want something different.  Someone else had the GNOCCHI in TOMATO SAUCE.  The gnocchi was over cooked and the sauce was really average - tomato... etc.... nothing really special.

Good thing is - service is really fast.  I didn't even know how they could make the pasta so fast!!  The portions were just right, may be small for some people, it wasn't the \"American special\" portion, the \"lumberjack\" special, or the \"supersize\" me order.  

Anyways, wasn't the worst pasta in the world.  But it wasn't the best either... It was somewhere in the middle.  The atmosphere was great, good vibes.  I heard the pizza was a great option - maybe I'll try that next time around?"}
{"text":"I miss the Terroni when it was back on Victoria street. Now that it's moved to Adelaide it's become more glitzy more glamorous version-though I have to admit the decor is beautiful. However, I feel that the tradeoff has been at the expense of the food (not as good as Queen West) and the service. I was here last with my co-workers in May for a goodbye lunch and the service was awful. Server snapped when a colleague asked for a pizza recommendation and was rudely told to 'i don't know read the menu'. Food took a long time to arrive and when it did one of our co-worker's pizza was late. When it finally did arrive, she discovered a piece of newspaper (!) underneath the toppings while eating! This was not handled well by the server at all-no apology given only that we were given two options now 1) new pizza 2) taken off the bill. Quite likely this was the most haughty service I've experienced in Toronto."}
{"text":"I had two build your own tonics that were delicious. Other than that, the food was bland, meaning they don't use any Italian seasoning for the food, not even in the marinara sauce. You need a ton of Parmesan, salt and pepper unless you prefer bland food and the service was slow. The EVOO is not quality either."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite Italian restaurant in the city!!

My go to dish- the spaghetti in canna mare (seafood pasta), with mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops in a tomato sauce.

Appetizer- you can never go wrong with calamari, or the Carpaccio di Manzo (trade beef tenderloin, arugula and parmigian)."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service. Cool atmosphere. Celebrated a birthday here and had a wonderful time. Recommend the C't Mang pizza and the to-die-for tiramisu. Loved."}
{"text":"Terroni is located in converted courthouse on Adelaide. The vaulted ceilings, modern lighting, and clean woodwork gives the restaurant a chic feel. The restaurant is busy on most nights so make a reservation. 

Terroni also has a gorgeous patio in the back. We took advantage of the warm weather and asked for a table on the patio. 

To start, we ordered the carpaccio, octopus and caprese. All of the starters were freshly prepared. The standout was the caprese. The tomatoes and mozzarella were fresh - whch is what you would expect from a restaurant like Terroni.

For the main, we ordered ravioli di zio paperone and tagliatelle alla bolognese. The pasta was made in house and you can taste the freshness of the pasta. The tagliatelle was topped with truffles which was a nice taste to the dish. The ravioli was stuffed with duck confit which paired well with the the mushrooms that came with the dish.

The desserts at Terroni were sinfully delicious. We would recommend making room for dessert. We ordered an ice cream croissant sandwich and a chocolate flourless cake - great way to end the meal."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and our server was alright (maybe a bit annoying) but the patio was fantastic! I went here for lunch and shared the grilled calamari (delicious) and the \"giuggiolosa\" salad (nothing special). 

I would definitely go back to try their pizzas and their beverages."}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch there, ordered pasta of the day, virgin olive oil, cherry tomatoes, artichokes, mushrooms, tiger shrimp and sprig of mint on tagliatelle like flat noodles.....

Not good, very bland and tasteless, even the mint leaves (which usually has strong smell n taste) was a bit dull taste wise

Partly i feel the ingredients didn't work well together, the individual tastes did not compliment each other, not to mention could have added a bit of salt?

All for $33.....

Gave two stars only for the excellent and friendly service with a smile from our waitress

I wouldn't return"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Terroni.

Having dined at the three locations in Toronto, I would have to say this one is one of their more beautiful locations. Their upstairs patio is amazing and is the perfect stop for summer. With plenty of light, room, and wine, Terroni is a great place to go with friends, family or just to stock up on some pepperoncini. 

Would highly recommend trying their specials, they never seem to disappoint."}
{"text":"I don't get the big fuss. Terroni really isn't all that fabulous. I can list ten other incredible Italian resto's while spinning upside down and blind folded. I swear I'll do it.

A few months back I went to the Terroni on Adelaide and it was lack luster. One of those forgettable meals, and that never happens to me. I decided to just call it a 'fluke' and head to the original Queen St location for a dinner with friends last month. 

The ambiance is relaxing. Great spot for a date, or a dinner with friends for catching up. On many occasions I've turned a blind eye to 'poo poo food' for a really good ambiance. The service and the food that night were just shameful.

I was running late, and the moment I sat down a man in a plaid shirt, sporting a serious hipster mustache came over to take our drink orders. He was a little out of it and not spot on. After he left, we didn't see him or our drinks for another 15 minutes. I started making jokes that maybe he was just some joe shmoe off the streets who decided he wanted to be our waiter. Someone else delivered our drinks and our waiter was no where to be seen again. After another 20 minutes we finally tracked him down to place our food orders.

We ordered to share:
The Caprese with Bufala Mozz - We paid a little extra to get the real Bufala but what a disappointment. They were the same texture and taste to boccocinni. They can't fool me. Really disappointing and for a price tag of $16, huge ripe off.

Warm Mixed Mushroom Salad - The mushrooms were delicious. A little crusty and dry, but that didn't stop me from trying to steal more than my portion.

I can't remember my main, but it was an olive oil pasta with capers. I asked the waiter if the capers over powered the dish and he insisted not at all. I couldn't  taste anything but capers, but how would he know any better...I mean, I'm not even sure he works there.

Our mains were delivered by another waiter and he was nowhere to be seen for the rest of the night. Could it be possible? Was my theory coming true? Could a random stranger just walk in and pretend to be a waiter?

Sidenote: They don't give you balsamic and the olive oil has no body. It taste like generic grocery store brand.

The evening was wrapping up. Tables we're clearing and we were ready for the bill. A waitress was kind enough to bring our bill, as our disappearing waiter was up to his antics again. As we were paying, guess who suddenly appeared. THE WAITER! How convenient. I'm still not sure whether he worked there or not, but I know I won't be running back to Terroni for his service or their food."}
{"text":"Went here for a Birthday recently and we opted for a family meal style option, was surprised there was no salad or dessert, just Pizza. Pizza was pretty good, service lacked in some areas for a 20% automatic tip which is included in the Bill because this snobbish establishment is one of the few pretentious restaurant in the city that does not split up bills."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and was surprised how busy it was for a weekday evening. I'm glad we made a reservation for our group of 8;  our table was ready and we were seated quickly. Service here was great. He was friendly and actually refilled our waters even when the bottle was in front of us. When we were ready to order, majority of our party got the pastas and two had the pizzas. The pizza did come in a reasonable size and smelled delicious. On the other hand, I felt like my spinach pappardelle dish was considerably small for the price I was paying. I guess at least it did tasted yummy and fresh. My fiancee got their ravioli and I thought it tasted average. The sauce was tasty but the filling in the ravioli was a bit disappointing. At the end, I don't think I would purposely make a trip downtown to eat here unless my friends insisted here again. I guess next time I could try the pizzas - which had double the choices than their pastas. If you want a tasty Italian pasta dish though, I suggest you head to Tostos in Vaughan."}
{"text":"If you're willing to endure the line and the wait, it's worth it. 

The patio is really charming during the summertime, the food is delicious and the wine menu is extensive (if you're shopping by the bottle). I haven't yet tried the dessert but one day I won't stuff myself to the point of non-movement."}
{"text":"I've been to the Queen st. location however, yesterday was my first time at the Adelaide location. It's much larger than I anticipated but holy packed! I had a 7pm reservation - we got placed at one of those tiny tables, where you're practically touching the pair next to you. After my exhausting day, we made a request to be seated elsewhere. After a not-so-pleasant look we made our way upstairs into the lounge and what a more appealing choice! We had a spacious booth with live music. It was so nice! 

My friend had the margherita pizza - which he made no complaints about (but that's always an Italian classic..can't go wrong) and I had a pasta with braised lamb which was so incredibly tasty. I've had similar dishes that lacked flavor. This one was very nicely prepared. 

Our server was really pleasant and made a great wine recommend when I stared blankly at a list of choices I'd never heard of. 

I'd definitely return here on a Wednesday after work -- even just for drinks to enjoy that nice vibe on the upstairs floor. The Portuguese (I think) singer was really soothing with a glass of wine. ;)"}
{"text":"Yeahhhhhh pastaaaa! I never really ate much Italian food nor am I connoisseur but this place really hit the spot. I had the meat platter which had yes, many types of meat like proscuitto...some other tasty named meats that I totally forgot once the waiter put down the plate because I was so mesmerized...Anyways! My main was the truffle pasta. Oh my, it was so good. The pasta portion was perfect, not too much and not too little. The truffles were thinly sliced and just delicious. Our server was attentive as well and friendly. It was super packed though when I came with my boyfriend. We had to duck into a nearby bar and wait for a text message that it was our turn to have a table. I really recommend this Italian joint for first Italian cuisine timers. It was a really good experience for me and I enjoyed the ambiance as well. Nice decor, nice servers, nice food. No complaints."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing. The meat and cheese board selection is also great.

The pasta, not so much. My seafood pasta was overcooked and mushy the last time I came here. I'll probably just stick with the pizza next time.

The atmosphere at Terroni is also why I love this place. It's a great place to go on a date, catch up with friends, or even host a small gathering. It's one of my go to places when I'm downtown :)"}
{"text":"No substitutions and no reservations. How do I know this is their policy? It was written on the bus boy's shirt. Yes, I assure you it was. Now anyone who thinks they are this good better be really good, so read this review with that in mind. While I don't think I'm unfair in my review, Terroni opened the door to this level of criticism with their smug policies so all is fair. 

Let me say it's a brave step for a restauranteur to suggest their menu is so perfectly put together that they refuse to substitute any ingredient, so you'd better get it right. Unfortunately, Terroni doesn't, so the novelty is lost and just seems pretentious. I almost think they are trying to make customers think they are that good by saying they are that good. Almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The wine list, where do I start... You know that one person who just tries so hard to be different it's obvious they are trying hard to be different? That person that has the phrase, \"You laugh because I'm different, I laugh because you're all the same\", hanging on their tongue so they can say it the exact moment they are criticized? Well that is Terroni's wine list. What a complete mess. I often find it difficult to order wine inthose Italian restaurants that are too Italian for their own good (thus refusing to stock French or Californian wine) but this was just awful, and when I did happen to pick one, it was nothing special at all.

To top it all off, the wait staff was less than accommodating for our large group."}
{"text":"Had to send back the carpaccio because the edges were dry and stale, it had obviously been sitting on the plate in the fridge for a day or more...then the salad arrived with rusty ends on the lettuce....the pizza was good but of the 3 basil leaves  that were used as garnish, 2 were rotten black!...
Service was friendly but qualitatively average....
I doubt I will ever go back, what a shame!..."}
{"text":"This place tries way too hard to be \"authentically\" Italian and misses the mark in spectacular fashion

While seated at the bar enjoying a glass of wine - that by the way I had to wait a good 20-30 mins for since the bartender was completely ignoring us - was asked to leave my seat for a couple that had just come in and wanted to eat at the bar. If this place took bar reservations that would be one thing but they do not and so I was asked to rudely vacate my seat because this couple were clearly the bartender's friends.

 I have never in my entire life seen a restaurant have such disregard for their customers. From the time you try to book a reservation and having them tell you in no uncertain terms that unless your whole party shows up at the same time you will not get a table, to the just plain rudeness of the staff, I was literally flabbergasted. Specific examples of their poor service from last night alone:

1/ My friend ordered a glass of rosé wine but referred to it as blush wine. Rather than the waiter simply clarifying what he was requesting, he rudely asked my friend what he was talking about, that he did not know what that was and ultimately in a very condescending way said \"you mean rosé?\"

2/ I sat at the table for a good 20 minutes without even so much as an acknowledgment or someone offering to take my drink order - I had to call the waiter over.

3/ This same waiter actually rolled his eyes when I changed my mind about the bottle of wine I wanted - clearly going back down to the cellar was extremely inconvenient for him even though that is his job!

4/ When the bread came to the table we asked if we could have some balsamic vinegar for dipping. We were told that they do not have any and that they simply do not offer that, no exceptions. Side note: they really seems to have an issue with balsamic vinegar going so far as to highlight the items on their menu that would traditionally have this ingredient but do not at Terroni

5/ My friend also asked for some butter for his bread preferring it to olive oil - again when we asked we were told they do not serve that. At this point we called the manager over who, rather than try to satisfy her customers, repeatedly kept saying that it is their policy not to serve butter. Policy??? What if my friend had been allergic to olive oil? When we suggested they bring some out on the plate from the kitchen she once again referred to their \"policy\".

6/ The one thing the manager did do right was assign a new server to our table as we expressed our displeasure with the service we had been receiving. Wanita came in and somewhat salvages the evening - she was very nice.

I get that Terroni are trying to offer an \"authentic\" Italian experience and that they have a brand image they want to uphold but guess what Terroni, they eat butter and balsamic vinegar in Italy! The customer should ALWAYS come first. There is no place for this level of pretentious attitude in a city like Toronto where there are a plethora of restaurants to choose from.

Enough about the service. The food was not memorable. I found the menu lacked creativity and variety especially with respect to the wine list. The pricing for what are in essence simple Italian dishes is ridiculously high for the average quality of food served.

- No dipping sauce for calamari - the batter also smelled and tasted like KFC

- Friend's seabream was overcooked - on a positive note they did take it back and made him a plate of pasta. However they did not give him a spoon to help him twirl his spaghetti

- The wine list is ridiculously small and only features one wine from Puglia in southern Italy! For a restaurant that touts itself as an \"authentic\" southern Italian experience, it would have been nice to feature other southern regions such as Sicily, Campagna, Calabria or Salento.

- The gnocchi was completely lacking in flavor and required the addition of a substantial amount of salt to bring out any flavor.

- The agnelotti were good but again under seasoned and did require the addition of salt at the table

There are much better places in Toronto for authentic Italian food, where the CUSTOMER IS KING."}
{"text":"The Spaghetti Canna A Mare is an absolute must-order item! You don't need parmesan as the menu suggests so the delicate flavours of the seafood really shine. Pizza is always a great choice too with its thin crust and crispy crust. Great place to celebrate any occasion with big groups as long as you call in advance for a reservation! Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day with my friends from work. The ambiance was nice and modern, it does not have that corporate tone that many other restaurants around the area have.  Initially me being me, the second I saw chickpea on my dish, I asked the waitress if they can remove it. As I hate chickpeas. The waitress kindly encouraged me to try it as they won't change the dish. I've order the Purpietello
sauteed octopus, escarole and nduja with fried chickpea on chick pea puree

It turns out that I loved the octopus and the fried chickpea and purée. It was an amazing marriage of the three items. This dish provided me a new perspective on how chickpeas can work into a dish. In order to do a comparison and to satisfy if I have made the right decision between ordering calamari vs. Octopus so I can be sure what to order for next time. I took a piece of my friend's calamari. It was way less flavourful then the octopus and I was glad that I didn't order the calamari dish. Moving on to my main, I love truffle, to the degree that if I was missing in action, If you light up a truffle infuser, I will come running. So of course I've ordered the following dish. 
Tonnarelli alla Norcina
Italian black truffle shavings, homemade spicy sausage, pecorino, garlic

The pasta was not bad, I would have preferred a little softer. However, I did not taste the spicy to the sausage. Overall, the octopus was amazing. I will definitely go back for more and recommend the octopus to my friends!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times in a week! the pizza is absolutely amazing...and this is coming from someone who doesn't particularly love pizza. the first time i went with my sister and we shared the san giorgio and don corrado....both incredible. the next time i went with my bf and we tried a prosciutto pizza and spicy sausage one. the crust is thin and prefect. an appetizer worth trying is the mushroom...mmmmm....

the ambiance and service were great. its a little cozy, two story restaurant. i would suggest making reservations because its popular!

perfect place for a date!"}
{"text":"I had read mixed reviews about Terroni before booking a table here. Most said good food but poor service. We booked a table for New Years Eve and had a very positive experience overall. We ordered fried calamari (the best we've had so far in Toronto), caprese and carpaccio for starters - all very delicious. We were also very happy with our main course selections - pizza, pasta, and steak. There was nothing wrong with the service whatsoever. Overall, very tasty food, great service, good ambiance. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I went to Terroni mostly because of the good reviews. Vastly disappointed with service and food. Our food was brought to us within 2 mins of ordering and both dishes (pizza and pasta) were cold. Clearly they were not freshly made."}
{"text":"Loved our dinner here. My octopus starter was cooked so well, pastas and pizzas were all delicious. Service is a little frosty but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place is NOT suitable for a casual group gathering. No separate bills.. What's with that? Yes, the atmosphere is nice and the food is pretty good..but the service is terrible. Our waitress was not attentive at all! Plus, we were charged an 18% gratuity bc we were a 'large' group. Awful! We left the restaurant and did not even get as much as a thank you from the hostess or waitress as we walk out. 

To make matters worse--One of the members of my party forgot her pizza leftovers at the restaurant. We call shortly after to pick it up and the hostess told us 'My guess it was probably thrown out but I can't leave where I am right now so I can't find out for you.' What???????

Overall, OK food (albeit slightly overpriced) but TERRIBLE service. Too many options in the city..I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow didn't expect this place to be so big inside! Came with a large group and got the papparadelle - it was pretty good and very filling! Appetizers were great too - but salad could be more flavorful and I wish the bread was warm instead of cold. Service was prompt and she was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here. Sat at the bar and shared a pizza that was quite tasty! Enjoyed our cocktails too. Overall great experience, ambiance and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Terroni has the perfect formula, good food, cool interior design, not too fancy or overpriced but not too informal.   Perfect for a date or hang out with friends.   It's a bit loud but it is expected and part of the ambiance.   The only uncomfortable moment is always when you get your bill and the 15% tip seems too little, and the waiters get a bit upset with the small tip.   The 18% option should be removed from their machines and leave it up to the customer to add their tip."}
{"text":"Traditional southern Italian cuisine? I don't know if I'm conversant enough in Italian food to distinguish one region from the next. What I do know is that Italians know food. I have quite a few Italian friends from different areas of Italy so at least I know better than to contradict an Italian in food-related areas. 

The fare here is true to Italian tradition in that all the ingredients are simple and fresh. Things change here all the time and menu often fluctuates as the seasons change. My favourite part of the whole affair was the vino but the pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good and each time I have gone for dinner the service has been exceptional."}
{"text":"Amazing patio! You really don't feel like you're downtown Toronto. And the greatest gnocchi ever!! Succulent Panna cotta."}
{"text":"We can always rely on Terroni for consistent great Italian food. We come here regularly and still our favourite Italian restaurant in town. 

I love their fried and grilled calamari. Seafood pasta is a must try but honestly, I haven't had any had food in his restaurant."}
{"text":"Always great food and service.

Best gnocchi and the mushroom salad app is to die for."}
{"text":"2nd time here, 1st to this Location. Went here for a friend's birthday dinner, family style dinner for $45/person. Overall meal was pretty good, but I'd only give it 3.5 stars if I could. Personally I don't think food quality is any better than other Italian restaurants for less. I'd go there for the nice atmosphere. Oh, and draught beer prices are crazy expensive. Their pints are 7.50 for only about 8oz."}
{"text":"I really do think that this is one of the most overrated restaurants in Toronto. I've been twice and both times I left extremely unimpressed. I think people give it a pass because it is very stylish and they like the aesthetic. However, the food is extremely underwhelming. Especially considering the price. The pizza isn't good. It's soggy, bland, and they don't even cut it for you. They don't even give you any means to cut it. 

Also, the portion sizes for pasta are quite honestly pathetic. I eat a normal amount of food for my height and I'm at a healthy body weight. It's not as if I have an out of the ordinary appetite. I left feeling cheated and hungry, and it tastes no better than something a below average cook can make at home.

All in all, I wouldn't recommend the pizza or the pasta. The calamari was okay, but it was nothing to write home about. Also, they do not give you dipping sauce for the calamari. Normally this isn't a problem if the calamari has great flavour on its own. But it didn't, and they really should quit being so pretentious by withholding something so simple that could make the dish much better. They haven't earned that right because their food just isn't that good."}
{"text":"Had a send off lunch with our office group and the decision makers made Terroni as the choice partly because very able to accommodate our large group of almost 20 - especially during the upcoming holiday season. 

If I had to rate the restaurant only on atmosphere, Terroni would get a 5/5. However we go to eat in a restaurant. The checkin was super quick even though it was during lunch time. We got to seat at the upper level and although good, but not as good as the main floor. The bar section is super good and classy. 

The orders were taken quickly and were served bread, olive oil and oil with red chillies. The bread was OK, but the chillies and were super good. Not very spicy, but very flavourful. 

Ordered a Marinara pizza, has no cheese. Comes with Tomato Sauce, herbs, basil and garlic. The crust was good, the sauce lacked flavour. My palate isn't strong so could hardly taste garlic. The pizza was just plain. Regardless of how one orders a pizza (a vegan option) and as it was on the menu and I didn't omit cheese, the pizza should pass the taste test. It didn't. The experience of fine dinning regardless of the dish ordered needed to be there and it wasn't. I have vegan dishes at many places and they all passed with flying colours (O&B, Drake, Liberetto to name a few)

Service was very good. They got an extra star for the atmosphere and service.

Updated 07-Feb-17

Went there last week and had a Vegan Penne Arrabbia. The sauce a bit spicy, however would have liked it with a bit more sauce. The service good and the sitting area in the main floor very nice. The ceiling 20+ feet high."}
{"text":"My go-to Italian restaurant to go to along Queen Street. This restaurant gets pretty busy during the weekend so reservations are recommended. The food is always delicious! One of my favourite dish to start is the Funghi Assoluti and perfect to share for two. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Terroni QUEEN before and really enojoyed it, so I thought that Terroni Adelaide would provide a similary experience.

However, Terroni adelaide isn't  quite as good: the food was served cold and the service was poor: we often had to get our own menus and cutlery because our waitress wasn't able to handle the entire patio.

Not much more to say."}
{"text":"This place is the go to Italian place for a lot of people and I don't really see why. There are many better ones in this great city of ours.
Decor is nice and the ambience is pleasant but it's about the food and in that regard they underwhelm.
Pizza is bland and nothing special and the wine is over priced. 
Inflexible menu which means no changes.
In a pinch they will do (if the waits weren't so long) otherwise keep looking."}
{"text":"Someone should tell these folks the way people eat in \"southern Italy\" has nothing to do with the taste and delivery of the food here...
It's all arrogance, by the way cut the pizza for god sake....
Buy some cheese to serve with the pasta...

This is someone's idea of what they think people in Italy eat, anyone that has ever been to italy will tell you not to eat at main stream restaurants because they skimp on everything and are very expensive."}
{"text":"If you are the type of person that asks to substitute, exchange, customize or want things served \"on the side\" this is not the place for you. Based in a strong, some would say rigid set of family rules and traditions, don't expect to \"have it your way\" at Terroni.   

Eating here with my Mother in-law and family, was almost comical. I think we broke almost every \"rule\" in the book. 

Asked for steak cooked well done; chef will not cook it past medium.

Asked for balsamic vinegar with bread; chef will not permit it. 

Asked for no olives on salad; they needed to take it to executive management to approve the removal of 4 pitted olives from the salad. 

Asked for dressing on the side; not going to do it. 

Now I'm all for traditions and eating it how \"momma used to make it\" but this place takes it to the extreme (we are talking about 4 olives) . So much so, that it turns me off from wanting to eat here ever again. 

If the food were out of this world fantastic, I'd feel differently and more accepting to their rigid code, but frankly it's just not that good. 

The pizza was tasty, but served cold, and the salads were standard greens, doused in a can of tuna and oil and that's about it. 

Remember, some rules are just made to be broken. Like reducing olive quantity from 4 to 0. 

-SZ"}
{"text":"Nice place for drinks, but not for food. They had rules to eat your pasta....cannot substitute for a different pasta and put parmesan cheese on my sea food pasta dish?! Food was bland, would never come back.  Sticking to my go to pasta place Grazie!"}
{"text":"Great decor, very friendly bartender, quick service, best gnocchi in Toronto

I loved it here"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The server was really friendly and gave nice food suggestions. The patio was very cool and had good shading. I got the grilled calamari appetizer which was pretty delicious but felt that there was not enough salad to compliment the calamari."}
{"text":"Terroni is alright. Their pastas are good. Even better than their pizzas.

Service here was not the best. They were slow and got confused with our orders. We were a big group for a birthday so not sure if this would have been better with a smaller dining group.

The restaurant is huge with lots of seats available, but we went at a later hour so you may need reservations during peak dinner times. It is also very dim in the restaurant that I can barely see my food. Prices are fine for the portion you get.

There isnt parking available except for street which you may have to pay for.

Terroni is a place that everyone seems to be okay with choosing. So next time your group is indecisive and can't pick, maybe suggest Terroni."}
{"text":"I usually lower my expectations a bit when dining at a chain restaurant but I must say that Terroni impressed me. I recently came here for a family dinner on a weeknight, I was craving some pizza and this place delivered. I got to try a few dishes which went as follows: 

Ricotta stuffed zucchini blossoms (appetizer): This was delicious; it was perfectly fried in a tempura like batter, not greasy at all. I am not usually a big fan of ricotta (it's a great way to ruin a lasagne IMO) but it actually gave this dish a great creamy texture which I loved.  This appetizer was also accompanied by a couple pork ararncini things which were ok, but a bit heavy. 

Al Salmone pizza ($17.95): this was a white pizza topped with Italian cream, capers, red onions, tomatoes and house smoked salmon. This was a fun play on the traditional combo of smoked salmon and cream cheese. First off the house smoked salmon was piled on generously, it was smoky and tender. Some of the best smoked salmon I have ever had. All the other ingredients worked together to balance out the salmon, the bite of the onions and the capers were especially nice. 

C'T Mang pizza ($16.95): White pizza with mozzarella, gorgonzola, pears, walnuts, prosciutto and a drizzle of honey. I only got to try a slice of this but OMFG it was one of the best flavour combinations I have ever had on pizza. First off the prosciutto, MY GOD THE PROSCIUTTO! It was of a very high quality, so smoky and the saltiness was not overwhelming. I'm going to say it, everybody seems to have a bacon fetish but I for one will take a good prosciutto over bacon any day of the week! Anyways I digress... the walnuts on the pizza added a nice crunch, pears and the light drizzle of honey provided the sweetness to off set the salty prosciutto. This pizza was damn near perfect. It should also be mentioned that the pizza dough at Terroni is delicious; both pizza's I tried were baked to perfection. 

The food at Terroni is obviously thought out and well executed. This location is pretty big and located in an old court house which gives it a nice ambiance. The portion sizes were generous and definitely justified the price tag. 

Where these guys lose points is in the service, our waitress did her job but didn't really give off much personality. The restaurant is very loud making dinner conversation difficult. They are lacking any sort of selection in the beer department which was disappointing (especially the fact that they had no local beers on tap). The food was slow to come out of the kitchen and these guys have a strict no substitution policy that they abide by, which is just kind of douchey.  

Overall I enjoyed my meal at Terroni, the good food was definitely enough to overcome the shortfalls in service. 

*3.5 stars"}
{"text":"My daughter chose this place for my Birthday Dinner.  As soon as we walked in it was like we were in Italy.  High stone walls, large old doors and a huge map on the wall.  Very rustic.  Great place for large groups.  I had the lemon salad with mushrooms and the spinach stuffed ravioli along with a Bellini.  Portions were a little small on the pasta side.  But, really we need to learn to eat smaller anyway!  Was very surprised they had herbal teas.  Many restaurants do not carry any!  The place use to be an old courthouse."}
{"text":"I went here during the summer with a friend after work for dinner. We decided to get two different types of pasta and shared - I would say they both were really well done but lacked a \"wow\" factor and I do not think the premium price paid on the dishes was really justified. After finishing the pasta, I wasn't entirely full so definitely be prepared to order more dishes if you want a full meal. However, their gelato is great and I would definitely come here again to perhaps try out their other dishes! The service was very attentive throughout the course of the meal. 

It seems like Terroni is a very popular destination for pasta around the area and I can definitely can see why. Their pasta specials are a good choice for a quick and yummy dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here 2-3 times since it's super close to my office. I've ordered the truffle pasta (Tonnarelli alla Norcina) and it didn't disappoint me. The portion didn't look like big but it was very filling (I couldn't finish the whole dish and had to split it with friends). 

One down side is that you can't change anything listed on the menu. For example, if you don't like basil on your pizza, you cannot take it out... 

The sitting area is pretty cool and spacious. It's always a good place to catch up with friends/coworker since it's convenient location."}
{"text":"Nice ambience--very authentically Italian atmosphere. Amazing pizza and pasta. I personally always have the pizzas--I'm a big fan of the Natalina, with spicy salami, olives (delightfully warm, baked with the pizza), and roasted red peppers. I also love that they serve Coke in the small glass bottles, and bring you a large glass of ice--it's so much better, and terrifically cold even before you pour it over the ice, so refreshing!

Their desserts are amazing--I love the salted caramel butterscotch budino. I came here once with colleagues for an office Christmas lunch (there was a lovely private dining room upstairs), and when people were torn on desserts I gave a small speech on the magnificence of the budino--almost everybody ordered it, and they all said it was one of the best desserts they'd ever tasted. The butterscotch pudding is velvety smooth, with just a hint of butterscotch without being overwhelming; the caramel is even more velvety, and it's topped with a lovely little cookie that's best enjoyed dipped into the pudding. It's also a very picturesque little cup--I always hate to dig in!

Coffee is, as you'd expect, impeccable. I love their Lattes--I don't know if they still do it, but they were serving them in Bodum double-wall glasses, which are wonderful--I use them at home--as they retain the heat of a drink well, don't get hot on the outside, and look great.

You can also order (at least their pizzas) for pickup/takeout, there's a cash register on the side by the kitchen for these orders. They also have a small grocery aisle as you enter with amazing pasta, olives, chocolate, etc., and Terroni's hidden gem, \"Peperoncini\" hot peppers--these are the most delicious peppers ever, but unfortunately they're outrageously spicy, so it's always a pain/pleasure experience eating them. I can't stay away from them, though, and always buy a small jar to take home--you can bring it to the table and add it to your bill, or pay separately off to the side after paying for your meal.

I took a star off an otherwise 5-star review because of their poor customer service in their strict refusal to make any slight modifications to menu items. I don't like the roasted red peppers on the Natalina pizza, which is otherwise my favourite, as they're soggy and mushy--I'd love to get the pizza without them, but they make the pizza with it anyways and I have to leave them on the side to get thrown out. What a waste of food. Their management team needs to grow up and get over themselves in this regard."}
{"text":"This was an odd one...
I booked a reservation for my girlfriend's birthday, just the two of us. When we arrived they seated us upstairs (not as nice as other areas) and although the place was mostly empty, they stuck us right beside a mother and daughter. The daughter (maybe 15ish) was reading loudly from a book and the mother seemed indifferent to the excessive noise.
We asked to be moved to a quieter and nicer spot in the restaurant, but the hostess just seated us one table over, clearly still within earshot of the loud girl.
We got up, grabbed our coats, and walked out. We don't plan to ever return. Granted, I had been to Terroni before and it was good... but if you're that oblivious to a couple that wants a nice quiet dinner, you don't deserve our money.

***We then wandered the area and found a great little pub called \"P.J. O'Brien Irish Pub & Restaurant.\" Settled into some Irish pub food and pints - had a great time!***"}
{"text":"PROS:
1. Great interior, very cozy and interesting.
2.The seafood spaghetti was the best that i tried. The pizza tasted better as a leftover-totally subjective opinion haha. Overall, great Italian food."}
{"text":"The mushroom salad was soo good! Everything from our dinner was delicious from pizza to spaghetti. My only complaint is the three desserts we ordered were all too sweet (can't recall the names). Will definitely be back for that mushroom salad though!"}
{"text":"Right from the get go, got my reservation wrong, waitress should have bit of manner to deal with clients, I took a walk to check the venue, went upstairs, it had a private party rude staff members from hostess to everyone when I ask few questions about functions, food was mediocre Pizza soggy, pasta with seafood , busy place but so do Tim Hortons
We were still eating and the busser wanted to take our plate while we eating, what a disappointment of a night, we end up going to Carisma for real food 
And waitress hair make me lose my appetite,"}
{"text":"Excellent food; from appetizer to dessert. Also a nice customizable gin+tonic menu!
Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Ordered 2 pasta dishes with a nice Italian chianti, everything was great service included. Will return."}
{"text":"If you want to know if Terroni serves great Italian food, just try and get a seat there at dinner time any night of the week. I guarantee you'll be greeted by a lineup. 

Luckily, the service is quick and you'll probably seated before too long. At that time, you'll be able to salivate over all the delicious southern Italian fare they serve up on a daily basis. 

If you can, get a seat on the big but covered back patio. It's truly beautiful and almost makes you could be dining in outside quaint Tuscan villa! 

My other suggestion is to order their pizza and to split it. They are actually GIGANTIC so make sure you come on a full stomach. My favourite is the smoked salmon pizza and the arugula and sun dried tomato pizza is also very tasty. I've also had the gnocchi (which I believe was a special of the day) and it was so tasty and filling. 

I love Italian food and this place does a good job of serving up satisfying and flavourful cuisine from the region. It's not cheap, but it's not as a expensive as its counterparts and the food is actually quite a good deal for the price. And even though there's usually a lineup, the service is so good (lots of refills!)  it's what keeps me coming back, time and time again, Well that, and that tasty this crust pizza!"}
{"text":"Waiter said to my Jewish friend \"no, you can't do pork on half. The chef won't change his orders because he's put effort into this and this is how it's meant to be experienced.\"...you're making pizza. Relax."}
{"text":"Beautiful building and delicious food.  We had to wait a bit since it was packed.  The pizza and two appetizers ordered were fresh and just well-done.  Considering we came in a group and split it, it wasn't overly expensive although I can see how it could become expensive.  Service was quite good although we were the youngest in the whole place.  The staff was really friendly/nice to us."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a huge favour and make reservations in advance, at least 2 days beforehand. You could call in or book online, which is very convenient when the phone lines are busy with others trying to make reservations. If not, walk-ins should expect to be waiting up to an hours wait for 2 people on a Saturday during prime dinner time. 

With that being said, testing your patience and the will of your stomach is definitely worth the wait! The service is pretty good, waiter service have good knowledge of their food & wine and the food comes out relatively quickly.  The atmosphere is industrial looking but cozy, like you're eating in Grandma's pantry in her modern loft in trendy Liberty Village. 

I suggest that you book well in advance (emphasis on the \"well in advance\") and come with a group of friends so you can eat family style. You'll be wanting to try everything on the menu because it's all so delicious! The portions are good sizes too, which can be easily shared. The prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality that you'll be getting, however your bill can really add up because you can't just go to Terroni and not have a 3 course meal with drinks. So save up! Downside is, they cannot separate your bills so practice your math skills people or else you'll be sitting there for as long as you've been eating :p 

My growing list of things you must try are: 
Funghi Assoluti - oyster mushroom & arugula appetizer
Ravioli di Zio Paperone - duck confit ravioli

{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Wednesday night and it was packed! I did find it odd that when my friend called to make a reservation we were told we weren't able to do that, but the wait was reasonable.

I absolutely love gourmet pizza and they had some of the most unique combinations. My friends ordered pasta dishes and we all loved our food and left the place stuffed!

And how could we leave an Italian restaurant before having gelato; it was aboslutely delicious!"}
{"text":"still happy with my terronis experience months later.  the quality still generally up to par.  you  cant go wrong with a terronis proscuitto pizza with wine, beer and good company.  unfortunately for.my boyfriend he was just informed that the more rare beer selection they once had no longer is being represented.  otherwise terronis is a decent spot with good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dining solo always can bring precarious dinners, even in the best restaurants.

The bar/waiting area...lovely, busy, with the feel of the main dining area, however I was sat in the basement...with the bad kids at the wedding it seemed.  I was first sat at the worst seat in the house I assume, and asked for a different table...in the basement.

I went for the Burrata appetizer, which was really wonderful.  Huge portion of a lovely cheese. My waitress tried to sell me the 20 dollar glass of wine and I  told her that if she sat me upstairs with the adults I might buy it.

The Cosi pizza was tasty,but not mind blowing.

An app, the pizza and two glasses of wine with tip, $85. If I had sat in the lovely dining area, ok.  As it was, just alright.  Thankfully I dined alone at Canoe the night before and had at least one evening on  my business trip where I was treated like a princess.

Note to Terroni.  Solo diner at your place, not so satisfied, $85.
Solo diner at Canoe $200 dollars and thrilled...use your little tables better.  Sometimes the solo ladies have money at home yes?"}
{"text":"3.5*

This was my first visit to any Terroni location. It was a place I'd meant to go but just never, ever got around to it. As someone who grew up on southern Italian cooking, I wasn't sure if I'd be bored with the menu or it would remind me of home. Luckily, it was the latter. The back patio was beautiful and hidden away and was almost an oasis you can spend hours in on a nice day. We shared a pasta and pizza and both were delicious. We also had a beef carpaccio as our appetizer which was okay but nothing to write home about.

One note: Terroni, your hostesses are useless. I work in the restaurant industry and once got a resume from a former Terroni hostess. I remember thinking \"I hear that's a well run place! I'm sure she'll be a good candidate.\" She was the worst candidate I interviewed. I tell this story not just as a fun aside but because every interaction we had with a hostess at Terroni was almost laughable. The one at the front had our reservation but when we requested patio she just gave us complicated instructions to get to the patio hostess. Not a big deal but could you not bring us there? The patio hostess, wearing a baggy hoody, ripped jeans, and running shoes did not make eye contact with us, greeted us with \"2?\" and then sat us at a cramped table with bird poop on it. When we requested another table, she sighed loudly because she had to clean that one and - without making eye contact again - let out an elongated \"Suuuuuure...\" I don't know who is running this department as our server and a busser we encountered during our experience were both lovely. The hostess job is not a hard one. Being friendly and well-presented is almost literally the only job requirement. Maybe work on this, Terroni? Sad such a small thing can stain an otherwise lovely experience."}
{"text":"Went to Terroni last night for dinner. My friend and I had a reservation for 7:30pm. 
I hadn't seen my friend in a while so were busy catching up and the server kept on asking us if we were ready to order which I found rude. 
We then ordered, we decided to share a Quattro Stagioni and the Ricotta Gnocchi. Before our meals came, complimentary bread was served. The bread was extremely dry and the dipping sauce had spilled all over the bread. 
The food was excellent, the pizza was a bit too runny but the gnocchis were delicious! 
The server kept on asking if we were done with out dishes when there was clearly a lot of food left on it. It seems like she wanted us to leave as quickly as possible . 
Overall, the food is excellent and the service is bad."}
{"text":"What's better than excellent service, great food at an accommodating restaurant? 

I mean everything Terroni was not. 

Our group of 15 got pretty confused when we were told to head to the second floor for our reservation when it was really on the third floor. 

If you like your bread with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette, you are out of luck! Only hard breads with olive oil available. 

I got a Spinoza cocktail, it was so so. 

We had two orders of calamari's. To be exact, four  pieces each at $17 an order. They tasted like Costco calamari's that I can easily make at home. 


Pizzas were good but we were told that their policy doesn't allow extra cheese on the pizzas. Sharing was difficult because they couldn't provide a cutter - and couldn't be nice about it. 

When everyone's main course arrived, we asked for some ginger ale and Coke. And...... No Coke! On a Saturday...... That's cool. I asked for some black pepper for my way undercooked pasta- will attach a photo. 15 minutes later, I asked for it again because clearly no one enjoys black pepper with their meal. Especially bland undercooked pasta. 15 minutes later, I finally get my black pepper. 

Ginger ale arrives after 30 minutes after being ordered. 

Because of the fact that they didn't sell full-sized cakes, we brought our own. But be prepared to pay a whopping $60 just for bringing your own cake. Yes, for the cake and not booze. 

Some of us felt sick after eating undercooked pasta or from funky smelling water. Will we return or recommend? Nope. 

Did they still make us pay 18% tip? Yes."}
{"text":"Terroni is an Italian restaurant that sits in what used to be a courthouse building! So, you definitely have to check it out. For this review, i'll probably be talking a lot more about the place. ;) 

It has interesting pictures,deco and not just the main level eatery area. But as you head downstairs towards the restroom, you are pleasantly surprised not by 1 but 2 wine storages, and these are the old school kind of storage. And, in one of them resides another cantina - one that you can actually eat and sit in, while surrounded by barrels of, yup, that's right, beverages that make your head spin and puts a smile on your face. :) 

Food: 
Pappardelle alla Iosa 
Taglatielle alla Bolognese 
- Served with a glass of house red. 

My dinner mate and i started off on our own respective dishes, everything was quiet as we were busy enjoying our food, we swapped, then swapped again.. all in all - great meal. :)"}
{"text":"I've decided to quit my job, move to Toronto and eat exclusively at Terroni.  
Went here on a suggestion of a co-worker while I was in town for business.  It was around the corner from my hotel.

Starter: Funghi Assoluti - baked oyster mushrooms, parmigiano, bread crumbs, extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, arugola -- INSANELY DELICIOUS/must get.

My dining companion had the Bolognese - a suggestion from the server and licked the bowl clean.

I had the Pappardelle alla Iosa -- spicy sausage with peas and mushroom -- again, INSANELY DELICIOUS.

Our server was friendly, suggested the perfect wine and his eyes lit up when we asked him for suggestions.

My only complaint was that the restaurant was almost too warm - stifling, but so it goes, when EVERYONE IN THE WORLD IS IN THERE EATING BECAUSE IT'S SO GOOD.

The huge airy space partially open kitchen was a nice touch to the overall atmosphere. 


Desert: tiramisu and affogota espresso
Perfect portions.  Perfect restaurant.  I think I'll go back tonight."}
{"text":"I love Terroni. 

I usually visit the location by Trinity Bellwoods - but on a recent rare occasion that had me venturing north of bloor, I decided to stop in here for lunch. 

Best part: unlike the original, they take reservations!!

The same great menu (highlights for me are the pizza and the nizzarda salad) with similar decor. They have a huge dining room on the 2nd floor. 

While you're in the neighborhood, stop in at Nadege for dessert and stock up on the best wines from the Summerhill LCBO."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere at this restaurant. I never visited the other locations, but from what I hear--- this is one of the bigger ones that can seat more people on a busy Saturday evening. 
We made reservations  and still had to wait for awhile for a party of 5. 
We were seated in a booth and ordered some good appetizers to share. 

They did not have bruschetta but something quite similar to it. It was delicious! for a person who is not a fan of cheese and would not normally enjoy cheese --- I did enjoy dipping my mini bread into the cheese ball and topping it with the fresh tomatoes. It was quite delicious, I must say!
Also ordered some calamari to share -- typical breaded style calamari... 

My meal was the famous pizza -- sweet pear and some other salty topping on a thin crust. To my disappointment, I had to slice my own pizza with Such DIFFICULTY!! felt like a work out and a battle while doing so --- the pizza was as big as the plate and so as I was trying to make the cut -- pizza was just sliding off everywhere.
I've always been a HUGE HUGE fan of the sweet/salty pizza like the one from IL fornello Fig Pizza.. Hands down still my fave!.  This one was not comparable. not the tastiest crust and topping flavor was .. meh... ok ~. 

my dessert was pana cotta and Ive enjoyed better. It tasted a lil bland to me.. i've had better pana cotta with more sweet/rich flavors

I did get to try a spoonful of tiramisu from my friend's plate and OMGOMG --- delicious.. It was bursting with coffee flavor, but with enough sweetness at the same time. After that bite --- all i can think of was how they made it so that I can make my tiramisu taste the same way. It was dry enough so that the cake would still taste like a cake, rather than soiled lady fingers.... I dont even know if it was lady fingers that i was eating ... but it was delicious!!!!

best of that night was the appetizer and my one spoonful of tiramisu~~~ 

maybe i shall try the pasta next time??? (didn't look as pretty on the plate when my friends ordered it.... flavors were ... ehh.. okk.. )"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with this place and will have to include them in the list of overpriced Italian restaurants in Toronto. The party I was with was seated at the lowest level of the restaurant which was nice since it offered us a little more privacy. The service was a little slow and confused but, being a big party, its understandable. 

What really made the experience bad for me was that it took so long to get the bread out as we were waiting for our meals. The server also didn't offer to get us anymore bread once we ran out. The dish that I ordered was a seafood pasta which was pretty underwhelming as the noodles were al dente (which I don't necessarily mind) but you can definitely tell were not made in-house. At a supposedly authentic Italian restaurant you would think that they'd at least made some pasta themselves. Nope. I will not be coming back nor will I reccomend this place. If it weren't for a friend's birthday dinner I would have made all of those things at home myself minus the non-fresh pasta and the 20% gratuity included with the bill.

Edit: Forgot to mention the poor person sitting across from me who had their steak taken back two times because it too well done and then too rare. They didn't end up finishing their steak because their appetite was gone."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am VERY picky about pizza. It takes a lot for me to like a pizza. It has to be non-greasy, non-doughy, and completely non-American. I will go running for the hills if you give me a slice of pepperoni pizza. 

My bf swore up and down that I would love the pizza at Terroni, and he was right. There was a long wait the night we went, but we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks while we waited. Their wine list is extensive and there is a wide variety of reasonably priced wines which are very good! The building this Terroni is located in is beautiful, so it's worth it to go and have a few drinks at the bar before dinner. Great atmosphere and ambiance. 

We shared a starter... I think we had the Tagliere Mezze e Mezzo? Or did we have two starters? Anyway, we had a board (or boards) of a variety of things to share. By this point, I had several drinks in me, so details are a little fuzzy. I do remember that everything was delicious though. We also had the C't Mang, which is a white pizza with mozzarella, gorgonzola, fresh pears, walnuts, speck and honey. It was amazing! We also shared the duck confit ravioli (the Ravioli di Zio Paperone). I rarely ever order pasta at restaurants, but this far exceeded my expectations. It was rich, but not heavy.... absolutely delicious! I would definitely order this again next time I am at Terroni. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome staff.  Tornnarelli allá Norcina, unbelievable!  Lasagne allá bolognese awesome. Buratta, Funghi assoluti, and the mix antipasto excellent.  One of the best Italian food I had in a while!  Looking forward to trying it in LA."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the setting perfect but the staff is super fake and condescending. With these prices and location, it wouldn't hurt getting them trained better and keeping them happy, so they can actually care about the customer."}
{"text":"I really like this place !
At work, I entered a raffle for a gift card to Terroni and ended up winning. With my sister visiting Toronto, I decided to use the card for a nice dinner on Queen West,

I made a reservation for 6:30; good thing that I did as it was packed on Boxing Day night. The decor is southern Italian nouveau with a little shop at the front of the restaurant, which sells olives (amongst other Italian goodies). Service was excellent; our server was very familiar with the menu and took time to explain menu items along with offering recommendations. We ordered a bottle of Rosé, which was flavourful with scents of strawberry and melon. The appetizers (calamari & mushrooms) were amazing. Finally, our mains (pizza) were fantastic - take a look at my photos as a picture is worth a thousand words.

Can't wait to come back to try other menu items.

Good for: pizza, pasta, dinner"}
{"text":"Was responsible for planning a birthday dinner. My first choice didn't have any tables available for tonight so I went on to Plan B.

I don't want to sound like a broken record so I won't go into the decor of the place. 

This place is PACKED. I was certain that I read on the Internet that reservations were a no-go here. Anyway, I didn't want to wait around for a table tonight so I called on Friday to ask when my party should go to the resto if we wanted to avoid a long wait. To my surprise, this place DOES take reservations. On Saturday, I was told, reservations can be made for 6 PM and 9 PM only. Reservation making was a quick and painless process. I gave my name and number. Reso was made.

We were seated in the Cantina area (basement). Close to the washrooms and spacious, I would recommend that you try to sit here. The volume level isn't to the point that you can't carry on a conversation. 

Service was absoluuuuuutttteeellly fab. 'Nuff said.

Menu is extensive, but I would highly recommend the pizza !! Yum, yum, yum.

Imma be back."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this restaurant and chain. I really like the quality of the food and fresh ingredients. It's family friendly and great for a romantic evening out. Last year I organized a private party for a birthday and I was so impressed with their team in handling the group menu, options and wine selections. My last visit here was on Wednesday at around 6:00 pm. It was just the right amount of people on the restaurant not overly crowded. We ordered the mezzo mezzo appetizer, carpaccio manzo, lasagna special, Mediterranean Sea bass and wagyu steak. Everything was prepared well and tasted really fresh. Our server was friendly and attentive. They have a box of books for little ones. We had crema gelato for dessert and my little one loved it. I highly recommend trying the gelato here. It really tastes wholesome and deliciously homemade. Overall great experience at Terroni and at this location in particular."}
{"text":"Nice space.. love the old building with all the beautiful details!!!
antipasti was great.. wine was great... nothing to complain about..
my complain goes to my less than average seafood pasta.. was quite boring.. and the clams and mussels weren't cooked properly..
desert was also disappointing, i ordered tiramisu... was not bad, but def not anywhere near it should have been.. cheese cake was good.. but that's about it..
wouldn't be in rush to go back there.."}
{"text":"Just paying the bill.. Was here for a surprise birthday party in the basement. Love the rustic furnishings and atmosphere. Music was surprisingly great. Food lived up to the hype for sure and more some. Our server was the mayor of awesome town (Cliff). Service was reasonably quick. The anti pasto exceeded our expectations. Pricing was reasonable as well and the clean ambiance was great too. Good wine selection. Will definitely be suggesting this place and coming back here."}
{"text":"Came to Terroni on Adelaide St E for dinner with four, and was excited to eat here becaues I hadn't been back here for a long while.

We decided to split a couple of appetizers to start: the grilled calamari and the fried squash blossoms. Both appetizers were relatively good; the croquette on the plate of fried squash blossoms being my favourite, but nothing stood out in particular.

As for mains, my girlfriend ordered the pappardelle alla Iosa pasta, and I went for the pizza of the day: a white sauce pizza, with (I believe) smoked prosciutto, spinach, mozzarella, and a fried egg in the middle. Her pappardelle was good, and we can't complain about anything. My pizza was a tad on the overcooked side, where the crust of the pizza was equivalent to some crunchy cardboard, and my fried egg in the middle was basically cooked all the way through.

In addition, our server must have been quite busy, because she never came to check in on us after serving the mains, until we managed to finally flag her down to grab the bill. Up until that point, other members of the staff silently collected our plates before shuffling back to the kitchen.

Overall, my meal at Terroni was okay. Service aside, at least the food as a whole was alright. The appetizers were solid, especially the fried squash blossoms and the croquettes that came with it. However, my pizza was a bit of a let down, and it made me wish that I had ordered a pasta instead."}
{"text":"Terroni has always been one of my favourite restaurants...especially this location. I find the food to be better at this location (as opposed to the adelaide one)
I ordered the fried calamari, pasta a la limone, and prosciutto pizza.
The pizza a la limone is not heavy at all and has a very nice, light taste. One of my favourite dishes.

Highly recommend you make reservations or you will be waiting for a very long time.
One of my criticisms of this place is that it personally way too dark. I could barely see what It was a bit tough to read the menu.
Aside from that, great place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This review is 3.5 stars.

We decided to head here for dinner on a wam and pleasant Tuesday evenining.  Although they now accept reservations, we didn't make any but were able to be seated within 10 minutes of arrival.  

We started with the tagliere del salumiere, which came with a selection of 4 or 5 different types of cured meat and some olives.  The cured meats were flavorful and well made but I thought the olives to be on the bland side.

For the main course, one person had a pizza while the rest of us ordered pasta dishes.  I ordered the Papparadelle alla Iosa, which came with spicy sausage, mushrooms, peas and Parmigiano cheese.  I found the dish to be well flavored with a good proportion of each ingredient.  The pasta was handmade and I found it to be a little too al dente for my taste.  Otherwise, the dish was fine and something I would recommend to others.  One friend loved her Ravioli di Zio Paperone and could not stop raving about her dish.  She said the dish was rich but oh so good and could have easily eaten another serving.  Another friend ordered the Pappardelle Larghe al sugo D'Agnello and enjoyed it as well.  He didn't say much about the dish but finished the entire plate so I can safely assume he liked it.  The pizza ordered was the Affitisciuta., which my friend really enjoyed.

The setting is an old courthouse and a trip to the lower level is a must.  The wine is stored in a couple of the old jail cells and the restrooms have some interesting decor.  I can only imagine what it's like down there when it's dark and late at night!

Overall the service was friendly, effcient and attentive. The restaurant was packed (for a Tuesday!) and the high ceilings didn't do much to dampen the noise level so be prepared to fight to be heard.  It was a little too loud for me, personally.

Overall, a good place for an fun and lively Italian dining experience."}
{"text":"I had a team lunch here yesterday; first time I ever had Terroni's and it won't be the last.

As this is the 200th review, I can't add much new.

Yes, it is noisy and yes, it is in a really cool space.

I had a pasta dish involving long, flat noodles, sausage, mushrooms and olive oil.  It was certainly some of the best pasta I've had in a long time.

The bite sized sample of pizza I was able to talk myself into was equally delicious.  

I found portion size to be fine but if you are more interested in price or portion, there are better choices for the North American take on Italian.  This place is more about atmosphere and quality.

Service, in my opinion, was excellent.  

Recommended!  I see this place working really well on for a 2nd-3rd-4th date, the kind where you are going to a nice dinner on a Friday or Saturday night but still getting to know one another.  It could also work as a lunch date place.  Given the amount of pizzas on the menu, it would be fun to decide on two pies and share them.  The noise level, for me, means this place would not work for a super special date night (anniversary)--but hey, that is just me.  There are lots of office workers in this area so it totally works as a lunch/dinner place with your office pals too."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Terroni and I'm so glad I did. We sat outside on the patio and it really reminded me of the patios in Rome, Italy. Service was quick and our waitress was amazing. Even better, was the food! I got the Rigatoni Arcobaleno to eat and I can't find words to describe how great it tasted. 

I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great food, service is bad. I called this place up last week to make a reservation for a birthday dinner, and I requested a patio seat. The lady didn't guarantee one and she said it depends on availability at the time. She put a note down on my reservation for a patio seat. So I made the reservation anyway, and I got a call on Monday to confirm my reservation. I arrived the restaurant in the evening and was told the patio is already closed for the season. What????! First of all, the last could have told me they were closing the patio by this week, but she didn't. There's no way they didn't anticipate that, unless they just one day decided not to seat customers outside anymore. Secondly, they could have told me over the phone in the morning before I arrive for my reservation. I would have changed venue had I known the patio is closed. I really wanted to dine in the patio. 

Well, it was really busy for a Monday night, and the food was amazing. The service was horrible though. We waited 30 minutes for dessert, and 30 minutes for the bill. Everything took so long. 

The food was amazing, and the ambiance in the restaurant was fantastic. I would come back. But I'm really disappointed for not getting notified earlier about the patio."}

{"text":"I have a good memory of this restaurant, because it was one of the first that my boyfriend and I went to when we were first dating. It's a pretty happening restaurant, which isn't that big (they should really think of expanding!).  

I ordered a vegetarian pizza, which was absolutely delish. The crust was really thin and light, none of this Pizza Hut mumbo jumbo! My boyfriend ordered some kind of seafood pizza, which looked good as well.  If Pizza Pizza, Mama's, 2-4-1, Pizza Hut or Pizza Nova is as far as your pizza tasting has gone, you have to, have to try Terroni. You haven't had good pizza until you've had some from here!"}

foods are amazing
the timing of serving is absolutely muched with the timing when we wanted to have next plate!

{"text":"Great service by Jordan! Hostess was rude. Food was great. This restaurant is a great GO TO place with decent prices. Busy Monday night with local regulars.  Dinner for 2,  3 courses and a glass of wine each - $130 including tax and tip."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Always ask for hot sauce and The Beaus lug tread IPA it's the best beer they have."}
{"text":"I had a different experience than the last reviewer on here that discussed dining solo; I, too, dined alone at Terroni while in Toronto on business but enjoyed it very much.

I was drawn to the restaurant from what I could see of the interior from the street - much of the old courthouse is still preserved, and when you're eating alone, it's nice to have an interesting space to provide some visual interest. The waitress was very helpful, giving me a very appropriate wine recommendation (which was incidentally not expensive) when I described what I liked, and generally making herself available for other questions/needs.

I ordered the Bucatini all' Amatriciana, and it was delicious - the guanciale was perfectly smoked and the pasta was obviously fresh.  I was so impressed by the pasta that I splurged on dessert, and it - the caramel budino - was equally good.  For the quality of the food and wine, the pricing was fair: $40 for an entree, dessert, and glass of wine (as well as complimentary bread with olive oil).

Very nice experience all around!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Terroni's for years and years, but lately, it really hasn't hit the spot quite the same way. 

I went on Saturday with a group of 17 and the food took an hour to get to the table. Then, we were charged 18.5% tip on top of our bill. Children were not served first and were very hungry.... but the server didn't automatically bring bread over and need to be asked again and again. Plus, I don't understand why they don't serve bread with vinegar or butter even. Just oil.

Food was fine, but it is expensive here. So I think that with all the other great Italian choices opening up in TO, there are more places to try."}
{"text":"While the service is sub par, it is something worth putting up with for the amazing food. The staff is very nice, but delivers slow service, to no fault of their own I think they're just under staffed and management should hire more servers. On to the food! The freshness of the ingredients is what really makes the food amazing. Theit calamari is the best I've had and their pastas are simple yet delicious. Would recommend to anyone who loves Italian food!"}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this review. I have been a Terroni lover and supporter for years. Always making a case for them whenever my friends and family would complain that \"they don't cut the pizza!\" or argue \"how can they not just remove 3 olives?!\"

My love for Terroni has come to an abrupt end. 

A few nights ago my husband and I went for dinner. We orded apps, wine, and 2 pizzas. To be honest, my pizza was not the greatest. It wasn't hot when it came out, and the mozzarella was not melted as it usually is. Making it even more annoying to cut.  

As per usual, i was dousing my pizza in the spicy oil with peppers. Towards the end of my meal, I began dipping my last few slices (yes, I ate the whole thing) into the oil.

On my last bite, I dipped my pizza and noticed a dead fly (wahhh) IN the dish with the oil. It was upsetting. And gross. And most likely had been in there the entire meal. 

I had a few bites left, but left the fly dipped slice on my plate. When the server came over, I told her about the fly. Her response was \"ewww gross. It looks like a gnat. Sorry!\" She then took away my plate with half the slice I did not finish eating. 

I assumed they would remove the $13 Margarita pizza off the $90 bill. They did not. 

I didn't want to complain, but I did. 

She offered nothing, and I asked to talk to the manager. He came over, and was very unfriendly. I explained to him that there was a dead bug in the oil that I dipped my entire meal in. His response: and??? 

Shocked and appalled, I explained to him that I thought normally when someone finds a dead bug in their food (and almost ate it) the restaurant would be more apologetic. I understand this kind of thing happens, but just make it right. 

He goes \"ok - a dead bug on your last bite. You know it's summer right? You should see the patio\" and grabs the bill off my table walks away. Returns, and tosses the new bill back down with the Margarita pizza removed. What a jerk. If I had a dead bug in my wine glass, would I be expected to just suck it up and drink it, because it's summer? 

Not sure what Summer and a patio has to do with the fact that I was dipping my pizza in oil with a dead fly floating in it, at a restaurant. It's just gross. 

The whole experience was bizarre and handled so poorly. 

You lost a longtime supporter and fan, and it really is a shame."}
{"text":"We went to Terroni for a quick weekday lunch. I had an amazing pizza - the Bufalina - which was great, a fabulous thin-crust pizza with lots of cheese. My friend had the Scaloppine di Vitello which she said was very delicious (I will have to try that next time but I LOVE pizza).
Service was excellent. The seating area on the second floor is just beautiful - in fact, the whole restaurant is an architectural wonder - but is also slightly cramped with the tables so close to one another. They have a huge space in the back end of the second floor, likely for large groups or special events. The bar is also quite nice. I can't wait to go back and try something else for lunch."}
{"text":"A downtown classic. Consistency is key in terms of food and service here, not many changes so you always know what you're getting. A good cozy spot for dinner with friends."}
{"text":"I liked the whole set up of this restaurant, and the atmosphere. Really intimate and cozy setting. We came here randomly on a Sunday night and were able to get a table right away. We were craving some pizza and there were lots of options to choose from. However, we could not change any of the pizza toppings which was something that we aren't used to. My fiancé tried to add prosciutto to our Margherita pizza but was told that they were unable to alter the menu offerings. Instead, they brought him a side of cold prosciutto and advised that he could put it on the pizza himself.  Furthermore, when we got our pizza it was not cut, which is pretty odd. We've been to Italy numerous times and this has never been an issue so I don't know what kind of theme this particular restaurant is going for. Everywhere from Venice, to Florence, to Rome cuts their pizza. If Italians aren't above cutting their pizza, why is some \"authentic\" Italian restaurant in Canada against it? Uncut pizza is basically just an added inconvenience. Overall the atmosphere was good and the pizza was okay as well (3/5 stars for the pizza) but it could be a much better restaurant if they let their customers change certain things, and if they cut the pizza."}
{"text":"Still our all time favourite restaurant!!! Love the atmosphere of this location and the menu. Our favourites are the pappardelle, bolognese, and the fungi Assoluti (please never remove those from your menu), but really you cant go wrong on anything you order. Pizzas are thin crust and spectacular. Just wish you had a location more north! 

(PS been to the Terroni's on Adelaide a number of times and it's never as good  - wont be returning to that one again)"}
{"text":"I don't know of it's the chefs here but the quality of the items just don't compare to the Queen street or Price st locations. When we order our favourites (calamari,  pappardelle, bolognese, etc) they just dont taste the same, and we leave regretting that we didnt make our way a little further to the other locations. My 8 yr old will always polish his dishes and ask for more at the price st location but will never finish his place when we come here."}
{"text":"So I googled this place and seemed like it had decent reviews. Decent is not a word to describe the food at this place and the service. Our servers name was Nathalia, she was very sweet and attentive to us from the beginning. To be honest we were done with Toronto because all of the places we went to had awful service so she definitely saved our perception of the city. They had a special menu so we decided to get half of the burrata served with tomatoes and crostinis. It was amazing, Nathalia brought over these red peppers soaked in oil that enhanced the experience. I ordered tonnarelli norcina for myself which was so perfect with the homemade sausage and pecorino. My gf got the tortelloni ricotta that is filled with butter, sage and riccotta. I tried her dish and I almost ate al of it because it was so light but yet so rich. We paired all of this with a merula rosé which was recommended by our server and was again perfect. We loved this place and recommend everyone should try it if you love fresh Italian food and great service!!!"}
{"text":"A group of my work friends and I dined here to celebrate a friend's birthday. She had been here before and had raved about their delicious pasta. 

We arrived before 5pm and even then, a number of the tables were occupied. Thankfully my friend had made a reservation for us. 

There is a good selection of wine and spirits as well as non alcoholic beverages. We ordered the olive and bread appetizer which is not very big but it allowed us each to have a few olives and bits of bread as we were saving our appetites for our main meal. 

I was torn between the butternut squash ravioli with Gorgonzola cream, and the duck confit ravioli with butternut squash and mushrooms. I ordered the latter. It had a richness to it as one would expect from the duck. The mushrooms and cheese added texture and flavour to my perfectly al dente ravioli. Unlike my friend's butternut squash ravioli which was sweet, my ravioli was definitely more savoury. The spaghetti al limone was light and fresh tasting with definite lemony brightness without being sour in flavour, and had big pieces of shaved Parmesan cheese on top. The birthday celebrant ordered the tonnarelli (think thicker version of spaghetti) alla Norcina, which had a meatiness from the slightly spiced sausage as well as a distinct truffle Aroma and flavour from the generous shaved truffle pieces.

There is a nice selection of Pluck teas, as well as cappuccino and espresso. For dessert, we ordered the deep fried Nutella fritters with hazelnut gelato. This was really yummy, with a generous amount of Nutella in each fritter. The gelato was amazing with a strong hazelnut flavour and a very rich mouthfeel. It was an awesome way to end our delicious meal. 

So why the 3 star review? I think the pasta was very good but the prices are a bit steep ($18-26, although the latter includes truffles in the pasta). Desserts likewise range from $8 for gelato or affogato to $20 for a cheese course. 

Disclaimers are placed in the menu for things like \"This (caprese) salad is not served with balsamic vinegar\". They clearly state that eggs and Italian flour are used in all pastas. I don't recall seeing any gluten free options for pasta on the menu. Like others have mentioned, one is left with the impression that this is one of those places where the chef is right (rather than the customer has the right to ask for substitutes as they wish). Nonetheless the food was quite good and I would likely return to try their pizza and other pastas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto.  Any special occasions I have gone here with friends and my wife.  The food is consistently good and the warm chocolate molten cake is incredible."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times over the last year and I'm pretty split on my findings.

One thing that I have to admit, I'm not the type to normally be impressed by salad... But their Funghi Assoluti is 5 star salad. I mean I don't even typically like mushrooms but I could destroy this salad without hesitation at any point of any given week. On the other hand, all the mains I've had were 3 star at best. Pizza was pretty decent, but was mostly made better strictly because of the hot peppers you can order on the side, they are really good peppers! One thing that let me down last time I was their was the Rib Eye Steak. It was a sketchy piece of meat, rather stringy and fatty and really underwhelming.

In summary - mixed feelings, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Had a gift certificate to the place and got a bunch of dishes to share.  Most of the food was relatively bland tasting and the baked pasta was cold.  Not the best italian to have in toronto.  Somewhat overpriced for what you get.  The only thing that was tasty was the tiramisu dessert.  Probably won't return - there are better restaurants in little Italy or Vaughan."}
{"text":"Oh Terroni... what happened to you?  Once upon a time you were a place to take a date for delicious, Italian food with some nice wine.  Or maybe a dinner party with a few couples where you could enjoy conversation over a nice meal in a wonderful ambiance... 

I had not been to this Terroni location before and had not been to a Terroni in almost a year so I was surprised at how crazy this place was.  It's a massive restaurant that was just brimming with children running around the restaurant. It felt like I was at a chucky cheese with kids running up and down the stairs. 

Maybe there was some birthday parties going on?  I don't know.  

I'm giving it 3 stars because the food was delicious...  and served surprisingly fast.  Here's a weird note: I asked for parmesan cheese on my pizza and the server refused to provide the cheese due to the instructions of the chef... I found that odd.  He tells the servers which food he feels should have parmesan and which shouldn't... If I want to put peanut butter on my pasta, who cares?  Why deny a guest of your restaurant parmesan cheese for their pizza?  I'm paying for it right?  

Would I visit here again?  Probably not... I might try the Adelaide or Queen Street location again."}
{"text":"Of all Terroni's locations, this one is my favorite. The space is beautiful -- super high ceilings, fabulous decor, and just an all-around interesting place to explore. The food is excellent -- on my last visit, I had the wild boar pappardelle: the meat was braised to perfection, and the pasta was fresh. The pizzas are the closest to real Italian that I've had in Canada. Service has been decent, too. Personally, I'm not a fan of Terroni's \"no reservations\" policy, so I only go at off-peak times when I won't have to wait. 

The only down point is the olive oil they serve with the bread basket. It's bitter and not very good quality. Save your carbs for the pizzas or pasta instead. :)"}
{"text":"Swung by tonight half starved and craving pappardelle, only to find that this location is closed/moving until 2011, a change that isn't reflected on their website or anywhere else. NOT COOL. UPDATE YOUR WEBSITE, TERRONI. Grr."}
{"text":"Its all about the pizza! I love this place!

I checked out Terroni's on a weekday around 7pm, there was no line up and we were seated immediately. But it got busy shortly after, and people were waiting ~10min for seating. They don't take reservations. It had a casual rustic feel, I felt comfy in the booth we were given near the door.

Pizza choices are endless and delicious. We went with the Al Salmone and C't Mang, both AMAZING. It was a tough decision, but I enjoyed the Al Salmone slightly more-the combo of fresh tomatoes, mozzarella and smoked salmon came together really well. C't Mang was a great combination of salty proscuitto with sweet pears and honey..mmm...

Serving sizes are appropriate considering the cost of each pizza is around $14-17. One pizza is enough to fill up an average sized person, I ate about 3/4 of mine. The dough itself is light, leaving your stomach room to keep consuming.

My friend had the Rigatoni Arcoboleno (she is vegetarian) and noted it was very tasty. 

I skipped on dessert (a tragedy I know, but I had already stuffed myself with pizza). My friend went with the Ricotta cheesecake, noting it had a unique sweetness level to it-not as sweet as a traditional cheesecake yet still very delicious.

All in all, it was a great casual dining experience that I will be sure to repeat. Service was SO FAST, it was 5-10min between ordering and being served. Not sure why, but they don't slice the pizzas, one small snag that is easily remedied yourself :)"}
{"text":"Why ya all gotta be f@&$ing man parts? Keep the olives.  Add some cheese. Do whatever the customer wants. Smarten up."}
{"text":"4 stars for an Italian restaurant in Diana's Yelp collection most likely means classy vibe plus solid food (fresh, house crafted with TLC, fine quality ingredients), but shitty value.

Food- 4/5. I've been here 3 times so far. The first time I ordered A Fagiolo salad (pescatarian, $14), which I highly do NOT recommend since it tasted exactly like the ingredient list: beans, onions, and tuna. No thanks. The second time I ordered the Farinata con le Barbabietole salad (vegetarian, $14), which comes with one small chickpea pancake that was really hard and crusty as well as some salad. Too small, I was so hungry afterwards. Tonight I ordered the Calamari alla Griglia (grilled not fried calamari - yay!) (pescatarian, $17), which luckily comes with a decent amount of calamari. I felt full afterwards, but definitely have had better grilled calamari elsewhere in Toronto. I was told that the pizzas here are overrated since the dough itself doesn't taste that great, but was also told that the pastas are great since they are handmade daily and egg-y, perfectly al dente. Next time! 

PSA... Complimentary housemade bread! And it tastes delicious, not your generic store-bought crap :)

Value- 3/5. I got only an appetizer for dinner (no drinks, no nothing), but including tax my meal set me back $22. Yep. The cheapest reasonable meal options (i.e. appetizers that can double as meals) are at least $14. I've ordered the $14 chickpea pancake salad here before and it was tiny. Salads are not terrible value since for example the Nizzard salad (contains heavy ingredients - eggs, tuna, olives, etc) is only $14, but substantial size and contents. Most economic options are vegetarian pizzas or pastas ranging between $14-20.

Service- 3/5. Fine, but we felt so rushed. I guess there were a lot of people coming in, so they wanted more outflow too. At least we got the food and bill very FAST.

Venue- 4/5. Huge, multistorey, and has a patio option apparently (I didn't see it today). The washrooms are in the basement and kind of hard to find since the narrow hallways down there are like a labyrinth. But the washroom sinks are so cool - lion head fountains, kind of like Roman fountains. Venue lost 2 stars for being too dark and cramped. There are usually A LOT of customers at peak meal times and the tables are super close together. It's hard to find some privacy, but it's surprisingly not overly loud. The crowd ranges from don't-care (me!) to very well-dressed (suits, dresses), but there is no strict dress code."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here! Got the pizza and pasta and split it and it was more than enough food. The wine was also very good. The interior is really amazing and sets a nice ambience. Would recommend going here!"}
{"text":"My Fav place. 

I come here at least every 2weeks. ups: amazing food you cant go wrong with any selection. Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.. If you are particular about where you want to sit they will find a way to make it work. Amazing service, its fast, the place is always busy. 

Its has a lovely ambiance to the place, perfect for entertaining your friends, tell them all about the history of the building etc, its a great story; if you dont know it, then look it up"}
{"text":"It's not often I write bad reviews, but this was a very disappointing experience.  Poor waiter and pretentious attitude about the place.  Food is over priced, very small portions.  Customer service is not a priority...

They have a 'we don't do that' attitude...

- No substitutions allowed
- No separate billing
- Poor selection of mixed drink options
- Balsamic vinegar is 'not allowed' at the tables
- Very limited menu

I asked for a cranberry and vodka drink, not exactly rocket science.  They told me they don't have cranberry... (what?)  they only have juice that they make themselves on the premises.  Uh... ok?  Is that supposed to impress me?  So I asked for orange juice and vodka... they were out of freshly squeezed orange juice... only had blood orange juice available... no thanx, just bring me a Coke.  Then they bring me a Coke the size of a shot glass.

I don't know who these guys are trying to kid, but this is not authentic Italian.  Their gnocchi was good, but the portion wasn't enough for my 5 year old nephew, let alone me.  Word of advice... Italians like to eat!  So don't skimp on the portions.

We also ordered an antipasto plate they refer to as 'mezzo mezzo' meaning half meat, half cheese tray.  That was brutal!  The only meat was prosciutto, couple of slices, some 'crumbs' of cheese, olives and breadsticks.  My parents are from Italy, I would have been embarrassed to bring them there.

Basically I left the place hungry and annoyed."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and simply love the food here!! It's ideal to make reservations as it gets super packed especially on the weekends when we went. Staff were friendly the food was fgantastic as usual! I ordered a bottled coke and the C't Mang which is a white pizza with mozzarella, gorgonzola, fresh pears, walnuts, speck (smoked prosciutto) and honey. Definitely an interesting combination of flavours of both sweet and savoury with the saltiness of the prosciutto and the sweetness of the honey. I would highly recommend this pizza if you decide to order pizza at Terroni. The pizza is large enough to be shared amongst 2 people but is filling enough for one person. Overall, a great dining experience if you are looking for a good night out at an Italian restaurant. Definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I came here for a celebratory catch-up. We split a great bottle of wine, and I got the duck confit-filled ravioli. It was incredible. Highly recommend. One friend asked for a different type of potato for her side and they were able to oblige. This place is luxurious and great for a fancier occasion. However, I was disappointed with the dessert (a lemon sponge cake thing) - felt like it was a let down after the incredible meal. Good thing we all split one dessert! 

Can't wait to come back here, though!"}
{"text":"Came in for a visit for my birthday and had the Pappardelle alla Iosa. Pappardelle was perfection! We also had the Calamari alla Griglia - very tasty and delicious. Absolutely loved the rustic aesthetic and je energetic ambiance here and the staff were really friendly as well. Definitely looking forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"Okay so they won't cut your pizza or put Parmesan cheese on you seafood pasta.  Apparently this enrages people enough to mention it in every negative review. 

The fact is they make some damn good pasta and pizza. There are many imitators out there now but Terroni is the OG in Toronto and still does it right. 

I'll admit their service can be hit or miss but I'd say it's good 8 times out of 10.

The building is beautiful and I've enjoyed the bar area for a few cocktails too."}
{"text":"Food is great and consistent.  I've been to all the Terroni's over the years but the original at 720 Queen West many many times.  It's expanded at least twice since I first went there nearly 20 years ago.  It used to be cheap for lunch but not any longer.  The place used to be known for great food, nice atmosphere and really snobby good looking female wait staff.  It was consistently this way and was kinda fun to go there and get abused (like they did this on purpose).  Those days are gone and now the staff is generally friendly and helpful.  The other thing that has changed a lot over the years are the prices.  Used to get lunch for four for $100 with wine.  Last year I took a few friends, ate a lot, drank two bottles of wine and the bill was $275.  Typically there is a line-up on Thurs Fri and Sat nights."}
{"text":"Terroni, you can never do any wrong. A winner every time. Great patio at this location but also the busiest one with always a lineup. Worth the wait but it can be annoying."}
{"text":"Terroni, you can never do any wrong. A winner every time. This location is stunning and a great place to go if you haven't made any reso's."}
{"text":"I used to not be into Terroni because of their strict no changes policy, but today when I went in, I ordered a pizza and didn't expect them to allow me to make a change but they did! Anyway the pizza was soooo so good, and I only have one ingredient removed. It was perfect, I had leftovers but ate them shortly afterwards because the taste was just everything! It's a white pizza with pears, walnuts, gorgonzola, and honey. Sooo good, the tastes!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this Terroni (I have previously visited the Rosedale cafe location, which I don't know that I reviewed).  Terroni has long been a trendy place to visit in Toronto.  It's not a regular haunt for me - I have always been a bit turned off at the fact that they refuse to modify their menu items.  I don't like olives, ok?  Sometimes, you just want to ask them to hold the olives.

I met a friend for dinner who really likes this particular restaurant, this particular location.  First, the place is HUGE and beautiful - definitely has atmosphere.  The service is great, from the hostesses, wait staff, even the security was welcoming and lovely.  

We started with the burrata.  The cheese was exceptional and the crostini was perfect - crunchy and tasty but not so hard that it cut the roof of the mouth.  I love balsamic vinaigrette and find it a bit laughable that this place is so against it that under the caprese salad listing on the menu, they specifically say \"this salad is not served with balsamic vinaigrette.  OK TERRONI, I get it.  You call the shots.  Anyway, would have appreciated my complimentary bread or my burrata with some goddamned balsamic.  

My previous visit to a Terroni location involved an amazing pasta dish, so this time I opted for pizza.  I'm not a huge fan of these thin crust pizzas (shout out to the food poisoning I got at Pizza Libretto), but I wanted to see what the fuss was about.  I ordered the Foca Meu pizza (fried eggplant, mozza, njuda sausage) and wow, wow, wow.  It was so good.  Absolutely delectable and filling and the crust had that taste....a fresh, stretchy, clean taste.  Not sure how else to describe it.

It was really loud in there and rather hot (we were on the second floor).  Add these to my balsamic complaint and you have a solid 4 stars.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to Terroni for the first time because I heard great things about them. I have to be honest, the whole experience was underwhelming. I agree with the rest of the recent reviews, they're really lacking in hospitality. I made reservations for 7pm on a Wednesday night for 5 and we didn't get seated until 7:30. We waited for half an hour even though we made reservations 1.5 weeks in advance. They also didn't tell us anything about our table until 7:20pm. 
Once we were finally seated someone introduced themselves as our waiter and then didn't end up being our waiter for the night...not confusing at all. 
I think the absolute worst hospitality item about the night is how rushed we felt. I'm certain that there was not going to be a table after us that night so I have no idea why they rushed us! Appetizers come in and swept away as soon as we've portioned it. Our entrées fly in and as soon as you take your last bite there's someone hovering behind u to swoop in and take the dish. The bill we didn't ask for comes out with dessert. Someone is standing behind you as you're paying with the terminal which makes me feel uncomfortable as I'm entering the tip option. How can we enjoy our dinner when it feels like we're always on a go go go atmosphere? Terroni seems like a place that is meant to bring people together and allow them to have an intimate dinner but I really did not get that experience.
The food is great and you can tell it's made with authentic with a flare. Good food with mediocre service is what lands them on three stars with me."}
{"text":"Quick Summary:
1) We made reservations for 6, however they placed us at a table with 4 chairs/plates/cups. The server brought the chairs out quickly, however failed to provide plates/cutlery until we mentioned it twice.

2) The service was quite slow and rarely did the server come back and ask if we needed anything else.

3) Food came out very slowly... and they decided to bring it out separately. One of the girls dishes came out a lot later, I had finished almost half my dish.... (The group started eating as  we didn't want to eat our food cold)

4) Food quality was just meh.

Overall- I would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I go here! Great pizza and pasta. Everything is fresh. Be aware - no substitute!"}
{"text":"Great food but arrogance is ridiculous!I asked for grated cheese on my pasta and the management said we don't do that?! Seriously, spending the money we did...:)"}
{"text":"Always happy with the food. As a started, I love the Funghi Assoluti. For mains it is always a toss up between the pasta and pizza. Both equally as good. I either get the San Giorgio pizza (very flavorful, not too spicy) and the Tonnarelli alla Norcina pasta. I've tried this location and the one by George Brown College. Food wise both great. Ambiance is more intimate and the service is better at this location."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city.  Great food, great service and great vibes.  I love the shelves of imported Italian goodies, and especially their patio in the summer.  Terroni is mine and my wife's go to spot for a date in our area. 

 I always start with a beef carpaccio and my wife has the ricchia salad.  Both appetizers use high quality olive oil and parmesan, and although the ingredients are simple, they are incredibly flavourful.  

Next we will usually split a pizza and a pasta.  My wife is a vegetarian so we usually get either the mushroom pizza or the one with goat cheese and roasted red peppers, and for the pasta we love either the funghi or the agnolotti as our go to.  We pair our entrees each with a generously poured glass of barolo--but we sometimes go ahead and get the whole bottle.  The pizzas are some of the best my wife and I have ever tried, hands down.  The pasta is excellent as it is made fresh in house, none of that boxed crap, and always complimented by a tasty, rich sauce.

Terroni, thank you for offering authentic Italian food and constantly delivering outstanding results.  I promise to continue coming to you as long as I'm alive (and as long as you're open)."}
{"text":"Visited Terroni on Adelaide on a Friday night.  I was a part of a very large group (around 20 people) for a friend's birthday party, and I had a below average dinner experience.

Four things weighed into my evaluation of Terroni: the food, the service, the setting, and the price and everything weighed my score down.

This Terroni restaurant is built on a courthouse, and they have some pretty impressive decor.  I am not a design expert, but I can see that a lot of effort went into the decorations, looks and feel of the restauraunt.  Unfortunately, thats where the good ends (for me).

For my dinner, I ordered a Branzino alla Griglia (grilled sea bass fillet).  The sea bass was seasoned well and grilled well, and served with a side salad.  I enjoyed the sea bass, but the portion was far too small.  I understand that quality is important for a high end restaurant, but I feel there is a problem when I clean my dinner plate then feeling less than satisfied (you know that feeling - like I could go eat a McDonalds cheeseburger?  In this case, I could have gone to McDonalds and ordered 2).

We were a large group sitting in the second floor.  There was a DJ mixing music nearby and the music got louder and louder as the night went on.  I generally don't object to music, but eventually I had to shout to speak with my girlfriend, sitting beside me, or to the person across from me.  Again, this contributed negatively to my experience.

The service was ok.  Whenever someone from our party needed something and asked a server, we were brought what we requested.  Otherwise, they servers left us alone.

Lastly, I was pretty unhappy about the price.  Normally I don't talk about price in my review, because I feel like I get what I pay for when I go to a restaurant, but that is not the case for Terroni.  I ordered a single main course (no drinks, no appetizer, no desserts, nothing else) and got hit by a water charge (yes-they charge for water) and by a 20% gratuity (they add in gratuity for large groups).  I ended my night paying over $40 on my bill and still feeling hungry.  

Overall, I paid an expensive price for a tiny portion of good food, average to below average service, and I did not enjoy my experience.

1.6 / 5.0"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. Why? Because in the end the food is pretty decent for the price and some people don't mind bad service.

It is just downright atrocious sometimes. They employ a wait-in-line only policy which is ridiculous. I can agree with a restaurant that chooses a no-reservations policy. But honestly, how hard can it be to take a paper and pen, right down a name, number and party size, give an \"approx\" accurate wait time, and call the party when the table is ready. Not hard, makes good business sense and would ease the traffic nightmare that is ruining it for your current diners. 

Nope, instead they've decided to employ an arcane system and just piss everyone off prior to their meal with a 40-60 minute wait despite over promises of seating in 15-20 mins. Unbelievable.

So, why come here? Because the food is pretty decent. Good selection of pastas. The antipasto was well constructed and the pizzas can be quite tasty with a crispy thin crust.

Would I ever step foot in Terroni's again? Nope. Not unless I have no choice because my friends are already there and seated or I'm going at a time no normal person would eat, say 3:30PM.

Service is an important part of any meal and they will soon realize that their horrible lack of it will eventually catch up to them. 

Then again, they occupy a great niche in Toronto, well-priced Italian food made from quality ingredients in a casual setting. Someone needs to fill this void."}
{"text":"This is a great interior with a perfect set-up for entertaining large groups. The long tables and Italian decor make this one of the more eye-catching tables. The food as always is adequate but unimpressive. The caprese is bland and the pizzas were sparse. I still prefer the Queen/Victoria location for it's coziness and food."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a weeknight dinner. I've been to this location many times and the service keeps getting worse. I visited back in March 2016 for a Bachelorette Party. The service was very slow and I had to physically walk from one of the back dining areas to the hostess to ask for my bill.

This time, the server was very short, did not offer bread, did not ask us how our meals were and generally ignored our table. Food is good here. But you can get similar quality of food and better service at Libretto on University."}
{"text":"I'm not a ravioli person at all but Terroni's take on this pasta, Ravioli di Zio Faperone, completely changes my stance. It's so very rich with flavour! And, righteously so when it's made with figs, roasted butternut squash and sauteed with oysters, button mushrooms, and parmigiana

Also, definitely, definitely, definitely do the Torte Caldo (flourless chocolate cake)."}
{"text":"delicious delicious delicious pizza. when my husband and i briefly lived in rosedale, we were here about once a week. at certain times, it gets VERY busy (think: 30 min wait and your back up to someone else's table). the pastas here are very good too. only complaint, as usual, is the price, but it's not even too bad since we used to just come in and share a pizza between the two of us."}
{"text":"It was an okay restaurant. They don't serve Parmesan if you order any dishes with seafood in it."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal and loved all the dishes! Everything moved quickly and got food in timely manner. Then the waitress that waited on several tables near us never checked on us. The manager told us he was putting us at the best table he had at the time (we had reservations 7pm) but needed it at 9, no problem right? 8:50 we walked out. Most plates were removed from our table before we were asked about dessert and feel waitress should of checked back sooner. Another small annoyance is that any restaurant that has a bar should have at least cherry and vanilla syrup. If one wants a flavor added to a Pepsi that should be easily accomplished. Food was outstanding and outweighed the service but can't say if it was a staff issue or bad night. Would return again."}
{"text":"This was all bad. I went to this restaurant because of my love for Italian cuisine, and most Italian restaurants are closed on a Sunday.  What a mistake:(

Let's start with drinks and bread service: I ordered a bottle of water and proceeded to get a $20 glass of wine, I politely asked for a sample, the bartender said No, we don't do that here?  I was immediately turned off, but I wanted to enjoy my evening, may I have bread service, please(this was after I ordered and saw her bring it out to other guests, but for some reason I had to request it.) The bread is accompanied by olive oil, which was decent, and upon my request for a little cracked pepper and cheese, she refused me once again.  She said I couldn't add anything to it because it's fresh from Italy. Huh?

Side note: I have been to Italy and shipped olive oil home, but that doesn't mean I don't like a little cracked pepper and cheese on top.  Yet again, I was disappointed. The manager said I could order a glass of wine and if I didn't like it, send it back and they would get me something else? Why would you prefer to waste a glass over a sip is beyond me.

Food was very mediocre and the lack of service irritated my soul. Please avoid. Not worth the time it took for me to even write this."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal here with my wife last Friday night. A great date night spot. We had the seafood pasta and the spinach ravioli, both were delicious.  Only disappointing part was that there were no tables available so we decided to pass on the 1 hour wait and we ate at the bar instead. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"One of my friends was craving for some pasta on a Wednesday evening and after browsing around on yelp, we decided to play it safe and come to Terroni,

This is probably my 4th time at Terroni and everytime I am here, I leave with a happy stomach and a big smile.  The pasta here is one of the top ones I have had in Toronto area, all their pastas are homemade and each one are done absolutely al dente!  I never had pasta this chewy before and the texture just WOWs my mind.  For people who are into softer pasta, this may not be your thing.

I ordered the traditional Tagliatelle alla Bolognese and I was very satisfy by the flavoring and the texture of the pastas (It smelled SOO good when it was on my table)!! My friends ordered the Pappardelle alla Iosa and the daily special Lobster Pasta (forgot what the fancy name Terroni gave it).  They were all very well made!

Previous visits I also ordered their pizza Affitisciuta and it was great too, thin crusted, right amount of toppings and great portion for one person.

You may ask, why an Italian restaurants be given 5 stars when they are supposed to specialize in pastas and pizzas?! That is true, if everything else were bad besides their pasta and pizza, I would of given it 4 stars.  What blew my mind is how good their desserts were as well!!  You MUST try their Tarte al Cioccolato and Panna Cotta!  I LOVED them and if you still got some room left after the main course, dessert is a MUST!"}
{"text":"It was one of the most rushed and frustrating dinners I've had, considering this is supposed to be a nice sit-down restaurant. We were seated on the \"patio\" which is a loud and crowded indoor space with a sky light. It's like an echo chamber in there, and we were practically touching elbows with the couples seated on either side of us. Our pasta dishes (I had bolognese, my partner had ravioli) were served before our bread even arrived. I had planned on ordering a glass of wine with my meal after finishing my cocktail. I had barely taken two sips of my negroni, which tasted watered down, before my plate of pasta was thrown down in front of me. Our server seemed confused. The food was just OK. Overall, it was a pretty unpleasant dining experience. I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"My friends love Terroni way more than I do, and since I work near it and they don't, we often end up meeting here for lunch. Oh well. It's not the end of the world. It's just nothing special for me.

The service is always just OK. Nothing special. The food is ok too. I don't know if the quality of the competition has improved in Toronto, or if their quality has declined, but I just don't like Terroni as much as I did 5 years ago. The pizza used to be so good? or was it that there was nothing better around? I don't know.

No reservations, which is kind of a pain. No substitutions on the menu, which bothers other people more than me, but I am not a picky eater either. No slicing of the pizza by the kitchen. DIY, dear.

The nicest thing about this Terroni is the outside patio in the summer."}
{"text":"I would say that their pasta is a lot better than their pizza. We ordered the seafood Linguine and it was indeed very tasty, but some of the clams had sand in it (yuck!) And for the price you pay, you think they can be cleaner. Their pizza is okay, nothing really special. The selection of their pizza is not really an exciting selection to me. It's either there's a lack of vegetables on the pizza choice or lack of meat, nothing that seemed like a good balance. And the meat selection pizzas were mostly of salty hams. Plus they charge a $4 plating fee and 20% gratuity for parties more than 14 people (little by too much imo)."}
{"text":"We found this place planning a going away for a friend when the only time we were all free was breakfast on a weekday. Most breakfast places only served on weekends, weren't open early enough, or had more of a fast food/diner feel. 

This review is mostly based on weekday brunch, tho I did have an off-peak weekend lunch here and the flat bread with porchetta was delicious!

For weekday breakfast, they do a great steak & egg with a truffle potato cake/patty? There were actually a few shavings of black truffle, not a lot but considering most places just use truffle oil, it was a nice touch. It's only on their weekday breakfast menu i think. I've also had their delicious Scandinavian pancakes many times that come with homemade jam and Nutella. And their breads are delicious.

I've also never had a bad coffee here, latte, cappuccino, iced coffee. All have been much better than most breakfast places and on par with the high-end coffee shops which is unusual for breakfast places. I find most breakfast places rush on coffee instead of taking the time to steam the milk. Even their iced espresso came with a side of steamed milk. 

The atmosphere is very chill, none of the rushed, bustle of a weekend brunch. A great place to chill on your own and work or read or a great place for meetings, catching up with friends, etc. 

I've never had the bad service that others mention, but I've also never gone during a very busy period. Tho one of the things I really like about this place is the chilled, not rushed atmosphere so maybe the service is a bit slow and I didn't realize..."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Southern Italian Cuisine
Location: Queen Street West, Toronto, ON
Menu items: Funghi Assoluti + Pizza C't Mang + Torta Calda al Cioccolato
Drink Pairing:  Red Negroamaro

A friend of mine introduced me to this place almost 6 years ago. Since then, most of our dinner rendez-vous take place at Terroni.  I highly recommend the Queen/Bathurst location, after all this is where it all started and the location never disappoints. 

Our meal started off with our favourite appetizer, Funghi Assoluti

I am not sure if its the combination of balsamic with parmigiano, or the baby arugula; but this oyster mushroom salad dish has been a fixation of ours for 6 years. There has not been a time when we don't order this to kick-start our meals.  Well, I take that back, red wine always takes precedence.  This time I had a great Negroamaro, which is a very well known grape from the region of Salento.

For our Primi we decided to try a different kind of pizza. We usually get the Puzza, but we discovered not so long ago the lovely C't Mang and once again we fell in love with Terroni. 

C't Mang is a prosciutto with pears pizza; which combined, offset the strong taste of the meat. The pears along with the mozzarella also serve as an opening ingredient to the Gorgonzola (Italian blue cheese). And right before you can say \"still too strong\", the honey drizzled on top of the pizza just makes all of the lovely strong, sweet and salty flavours come together. Buon Appetito!

To finish off the night, and make it a traditional visit to Terroni, we order dessert - Torta Calda al Cioccolato

I am just going to go ahead and describe it, because is that good! This is a warm flourless chocolate cake drizzled with white chocolate ganache. As you can see form the picture, the cake is soft and moist. Once your spoon digs in, there is not stopping from than moment on."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????!"}
{"text":"Are they serious with those prices? $30 for a fish - that's not even a whole fish but just a filet!! Mind blown that this is possible in a city that has some of the best tasting and reasonably priced food joints. Oh and service is not up to the standard- with those prices the service should equate with Four Seasons not Jack Astors. Good atmosphere and good music - I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Have only been here once before and many many years ago, so I wasn't sure what to expect. My friend suggested Terroni as it's one of her favourites, and it did not disappoint. 

I thought it silly to make a reservation for 6pm, but I'm happy we did as it was already busy and bustling by the time we arrived. Smells good and sounds lovely as soon as you enter, but not in an overwhelming way. 

I had a martini that was very nicely prepared exactly as requested, and then came the feast. Two of us shared the meat and cheese assortment and it was a great starter. Then it was onto mains. My friend's pasta looked delicious and my Puzza white pizza was fantastic: thin crust with enough toppings for flavour but not to mask the fresh pizza goodness. We both wanted dessert but just could not physically make room for more food as the portions are quite generous. Next time!"}
{"text":"My favorite terroni location in toronto. Decoration and foods are very good. Today i had salmon served with arugula and eggplant , it was a little bit dry but side dishes were amazing. I like their breads, very Italian, and charcuterie plate."}
{"text":"As a pizza lover, Terronis is my go to place for Napolitain pizza.  Excellent crust, very tasty, quality ingredients and nice atmosphere.  Not as noisy or as pretentious as that other overrated hipster place on Queen St East if you know what i mean."}
{"text":"We had a large group at Terroni (12+ people), and the food was decent.  Prices have gone up.  Service left a little to be desired at times, as drink requests had to be repeated a few times and our server confused who ordered what dishes.  We did have a large party though.

The booking process was annoying, as it was difficult to book and confirm our table.  

There are better places to go for pizza (such as libretto and Queen margherita), and you will get less attitude..."}
{"text":"Make sure you make a reservation! 
Amazing homemade pasta apparently done from scratch each day. I tried the agnoletti alla lilli with spinach, ricotta, parmesan, sage -- and lots of butter. Just perfect pasta, I love that about proper Italian places. The wines are very expensive and the prices for half a bottle make no sense given what a glass costs, but I couldn't commit to a bottle so I tried a tequila and lemon cocktail that was quite nice. The service was friendly and prompt; the food came quickly, and there is a tremendous variety of seating. A fun, family-style, high-end Italian restaurant using quality ingredients. I look forward to trying the pizza another time."}
{"text":"So when we arrived on a Sunday evening there was a 30min wait to be seated. Be prepared to wait. We were seated at the bar and ordered the Smendozzata pizza and the ravioli stuffed with duck.

We found the pizza to be pretty good for Toronto standards and did remind me of the pizza we tried in Italy. I found the topping tasted good but hoped for more of them. 

Our favorite dish was the ravioli stuffed with duck. Tasted amazing. 

I'd recommend trying out Terroni but don't think I would come on a regular basis do to the price. Each meal was about $20 and not the biggest portions."}
{"text":"Love this place! Doesnt get more authentic italian than this spot. Came here for mother's day and they had delicious mimosas and a great ambience for a nice lunch. We shared the caprese salad and ordered the peppino pizza which had zucchini, eggplant, roasted red pepper and parmagiano... delish! We also ordered the lemon pasta that comes with capers and spinach... it's my all time favourite pasta dish. Flavours are spot on. One of us also ordered the paparadelle with spicy sausage and it was hearty and spicy. The stars of the meal was the dessert. Highly recommend getting the tiramisu and budino which is a butterscotch pudding with light cream on top. Soo good!"}
{"text":"So - I miss the old mid-town Terroni - and I know these guys are opening a full restaurant soon, so will keep that in perspective.  Packed and full of cool Summerhill / Rosedale crew.  Nice wine list and some very tasty items - my issue is that the price to WAY TOO HIGH for the quality and there are some pretty chintzy servings.  Went with a girlfriend and our 'snack & wine' came to over $200 - there is a touch of that Terroni snobbishness too, with aloof waitresses and lack of flexibility...still good place for a glass of wine...maybe avoid trying to make it dinner and stick to the pastas."}
{"text":"A friend and I checked out Terroni after a Raptors game and it was the best decision of the night! The place had a buzz when we walked in and that's the atmosphere you want on a Friday night. We shared the calamari as our app and it was cripsy and tender, cooked perfectly without too mich grease.  My friend order a pizza which had goat cheese and sundries tomatoes and I got the ravioli with duck confit, fig and butternut squash. The pizza's crust was thin and flaky while the toppings were generous.  The ravioli I had was the best I've ever had so far.  The topped it with a white wine sauce and oyster mushrooms...yum! I've already planned to make another trip back for my girlfriend's bday. Great food, great service, great place!

Food- 5
Service- 4
Buzz- 4.5
Price- 4"}
{"text":"It was a debate whether this should be 3 or 4. Why 4? Trendy ambiance and awesome croissant ice cream dessert that my sister has decided should be her wedding cake. Why 3? Service is unattractive. Apparently that's the new trendy restaurant thing - super casual but still seems unhelpful to me? I actually loved my main dish! The truffle pasta! But you must love truffle. My sister got the duck confit ravioli. I liked it, she didn't love it but liked it. My other sister got a pizza that I also thought was good but she just wasn't blown away. It might be that this just didn't live up to the hype given the many recommendations for this place after we asked: where is THE place to eat in Toronto?"}
{"text":"I've been there 2 times and every time i came out happy. The place is nice and you can stay there for a long time without anybody bothering you. 
The food can be a little pricy for Italian but the service and quality make up for it.
Definitely recommend it if you want to have a easy going food experience with a touch of higher restaurant service."}
{"text":"Took my mother here for Mother's Day. The last slice of pizza had a super long black hair. When we told our server, she said we ate most of the pizza and could not get a new one. We were not asking for a new pizza, just pointing out the lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"I am really a fan of all Terroni locations, especially Queen Street, but this one is a favourite too - the building/design are breathtaking. This builing was built in the 1850s and has housed many things, including Courthouse Market Grille, Courthouse Chamber Lounge, Live@Courthose, Adelaide Street Courthouse, York County Magistrates Court, York County Courthouse, Toronto's Arts & Letters Club...

Terroni Adelaide has a cool area at the front \"lobby\" area they've called the \"enoteca\", which is essentially a wine/antipasto bar. In Italy, this would be a stand-alone establishment, not a section of a restaurant, but it's still a really cool idea.

They lose a star because they have screwed up my reservations twice (out of 4 or 5 times), and they are not very proactive about problem-solving. Basically, to get any attention, you have to cause a fuss or become bitchy. It's like they ONLY know how to do crisis intervention customer service or something. The servers are more capable than the hostesses, at least.

This is a great place for groups (seats up to 300 inside), less good for couples (if you're looking for quiet/intimate/romantic). It's loud and lively!

My favourite app is FUNGHI ASSOLUTI - it's baked oyster mushrooms w/ parmigiano, bread crumbs, balsamic vinegar, x-virgin olive oil, garlic and parsley served on arugola. MMMMMMM!!!

The INSALATE RICCHIA is my favourite salad - arugula, mushrooms, and big parmigiano reggiano shavings with some sort of lemony vinegarette.

My favourite pizza (which comes uncut, which is Italian restaurant tradition!) is the PEPPINO - it reminds me a lot of the pizzas I ate while travelling all over Italy - it has tomato, garlic, grilled eggplant, zucchini, grilled red peppers, parmigiano. The BUFALINA is great too - just tomato, mozzarella di bufalo and basil. The pizza is baked in oak ovens, is cracker-thin, and WONDERFUL! 

Interesting fact #1: The wine is kept in the basement's old jail cells!
Interesting fact #2: \"Terroni\" means \"people of the earth\".
Interesting fact #3: All the pizzas are named after the owner's family members."}
{"text":"My sister and her bf suggested Terroni for a dinner during my last trip to Toronto. I am a big fan of the Queen West neighbourhood since I used to live there for over 2 years. There are always great cafés, boutiques and yummy eats. For some reason Terroni flew under my radar!

We were seated upstairs at a cozy table for four. We ordered a bottle of red and some apps- the quatro sampler & the cheese/charcuterie plate. Everything was beautifully presented which felt extra special. We each ordered different mains, I opted for the Pappardell alla Iosa which had spicy sausage, button and oyster mushrooms. I polished off the plate- the portion was standard and the food was delicious.

We shared the tiramisu for dessert which was the perfect ending. Great atmosphere for a date night or dinner out with friends."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.  

Service:  I think our waiter may have been severely under the influence.  Or maybe he was slipping into a diabetic coma.  Whatever the case, our server was awful.  We were a table full of servers so we really tried to cut him some slack but eventually our patience wore out.  He mumbled, forgot everything we ordered, couldn't be bothered to bring us salt & pepper, olive oil, or water (despite numerous requests).  He was plenty attentive when it came time to bring the check- he stood at our table and waited for us to pay the bill.  We were there during off hours- there was no need to rush us out the door.  

Food: Overpriced, mediocre flavor, unimaginative presentation.  The 4 entrees we ordered were delivered piece-by-piece over the course of 5+ minutes.  I ordered the caprese (which, by definition, is tomato + basil + buffalo mozzarella) but needed to pay extra for buffalo mozzarella and came with a basil garnish but was otherwise lacking.  The menu explicitly stated that the salad did not come with balsamic but when the food was delivered, I asked for a side of it.  The waitress told me they didn't serve it with balsamic because the acidity would ruin the mozzarella and because they used such a superior cheese, it wasn't really necessary.  I said I understood, but would still like a side of it.  She refused and insisted that I wouldn't need it.  Imagine my delight when the cheese was no better than mozz from the grocery store.  There is absolutely no reason a server should refuse a request from a CUSTOMER that can be so-easily accommodated.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great place with good food. The carpaccio was great so were the mini donuts with nutella."}
{"text":"Although I will say this is a restaurant not for the thin walleted folk, it is fantastic Italian food. I had the hand rolled Gnocchi and it was fantastic! Also the warm mushroom salad and for dessert the tiramisu. I also recommend their biscotti at the counter they have a little selection there but they are darn good!"}
{"text":"Sat night at Terroni: was highly anticipating this popular restaurant. Unfortunately, I was left a little disappointed. Atmosphere was lovely upon entering, even what is essentially a colossal basement is made to feel nice and cozy. I ordered a ginger ale as soon as I sat down, it never came.  Fine, okay, so I asked for a wine menu . . . it never came. At least we saved money on the drinks as the waitress didn't bring my husbands second beer as well! Anyway, I got the mushroom/proscuitto pizza which was pretty good although very difficult to cut (I was trying to be civilized with a fork and knife as we were among some important guests!). Then . . . the wait began. Waited for everything to be cleared. Waited for the bill (they won't give you separate bills, kind of a pain), waited for the change and were then told they needed the table for the next guests. I was practically asleep at the table from all the mind numbing waiting. Maybe the fault lies a little bit with our 15 person party - perhaps we were a lot to manage. 
Overall, fine. I would give it a second chance but order pasta next time."}
{"text":"Terroni has gone down an ugly path of skipping out on quantity and quality which is sad for a place in which I myself being Italian thought of as a great place to have authentic Italian cuisine... I suggest if you want to have a great Italian experience I would not recommend coming here there are better choices and you'll save your money cheers."}
{"text":"Consistently decent is how I'd describe this.

For appetizer, the Funghi Assoluti, apparently is an really old recipe of theirs. It's oyster mushrooms with breadcrumbs and vinagarette. They were good, I'd order it again.

Gotta have the pizza, for those who don't know exactly what to eat, have the Quattro Stagioni. Basically four pizzas in one. The pizza itself is pretty good pizza. Toronto is going through this thin crust Neapolitan pizza craze, and really Terroni was probably here first. I don't think they do it best, but they do it well.

Fried calamari was nothing to write home about.

I don't know what it was though, service as just ok. I kinda felt like with things we ordered, he wasn't too happy because we didn't take what he may have tried to recommend. 

Might still come back as it's close by and ok."}
{"text":"On our first night in Toronto we headed here on a native's recommendation and weren't disappointed. This place was busy and we didn't have a reservation and they seated us immediately with the caveat we be finished by 8:30 (we got there around 7:00). The portions were good size and the food was awesome. We had an appetizer of olives and sliced meats, and it was terrific. The spicy green olives were very tasty. I followed up the appetizer with a caprese salad and a spicy pizza with mushrooms which was enough for two and both were very tasty. We ran a little over our 8:30 deadline but didn't feel pressured at all to eat fast. The staff was very attentive.  The one thing I will say about this place is that it is targeting a younger trendy audience, you've got a dj spinning as you walk in and the music is loud (not to me, but to some in my party it was hard to hear each other. I would definitely recommend this place if you want some tasty Italian food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Terroni is a place you can find yourself coming back to often. Is has that chill vibe and balance where it's acceptable for both very casual or dressy occasions. Their menu is classic and their service is pretty consistent. You could hang out here for awhile and not realize how much time has past. You get the complete experience ^^"}
{"text":"So after walking past this place way too many times and admiring the interior from the outside and then reading some of the reviews on here (peoples' favorite Terroni, etc. etc.), I decided to walk into this place on a Saturday night with my fiance.  We were told to expect a 40 minute wait -- not bad, we thought, and decided to grab a drink at the bar and enjoy the decor.

The energy of the front foyer was lively and they were playing great music, so we didn't mind at first, but when an hour had passed, we decided to check our status, and we were told \"just another 20 minutes\", so we figured we would just wait.  Not a good idea.  It was another hour (i.e. a total of two hours) before we were seated, and when I made it clear to our hostess that we wouldn't have stuck around had we been given an accurate wait time (which I don't think would've been hard to do, simply my looking at the number of couples ahead of us and the limited number of two seaters in the main room), she simply apologized and didn't offer anything in terms of compensation.

Was the food worth the wait?  No, not even close.  We tried all the highly acclaimed dishes (the mushroom antipasti salad, the duck confit ravioli, and our server recommended one of the white sauce pizzas)...the first two were decent, but the pizza seemed really undercooked and inedible.  Abby couldn't have more than a couple of bites.  Also, the main dining area is not nearly as nice as the waiting area/bar.  So overall, I'm going to have give Terroni a big thumbs down.  Oh yeah, I was also not impressed by one of the girls from a bachelorette party grabbing my ass and then laughing about it as though it were an accident while I was waiting in the main area.  Not my idea of fun, although my fiance seemed to find it amusing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.  Food is always spectacular, bar area is great if your own your own of with a buddy and do not feel like sitting in the dining room.

Food is consistent, yummy, craving it as I am writing this review."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say that this is one of my favourite restaurants, but I won't give it five stars as they do not have Diet Coke.  So maybe it's worth more like 4.5 stars.  

The fresh pasta is delicious.  My favourite is the rigatoni with zucchini and buffalo mozzarella.  The rest of my party had pizza and they enjoyed it very much. 

This time my husband's pizza was pretty badly burnt on one side but he didn't notice right away as he started eating the non burnt side first.  He brought it to the server's attention but felt bad he had already eaten half. She graciously apologized and brought him a replacement just as quickly as it could be made.  She was very pleasant and attentive.  Service was excellent.  Actually service is always great here so I was surprised at some of the other reviews. 

The dessert with butterscotch pudding is my absolute favourite dessert in Toronto. 

Although a bit pricey, please bring me my Diet Coke and the 5 stars are yours."}
{"text":"Every time that I've been to Terroni (at least 5 times) it has never disappointed me. I know that I can recommend it to my friends and they will have a enjoyable experience. The food is great, the ambiance is equally as fun.

I think the major problem with this place is that some of the staff seem to have a bit of an attitude problem. It's really hit and miss. Sometimes you'll have somebody who is attentive and shows a general interest in your meal. Other times you'll just get somebody who seems to have contempt for you. Either way it's a bit of a blemish on an otherwise great restaurant. I don`t know what it is like at the other Terroni`s so I can`t say if it is a chain wide problem or something specific to the Adelaide location."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars 

Overall a good place to grab lunch/dinner (this is for the Adelaide E location).  It used to be an old courthouse so the ambiance is quite nice/cool and it's conveniently located downtown - large space that is good for large groups.

Was here for NYE and our group tried several apps and a few of the mains.  We had as apps:

- carpaccio 
- grilled calamari
- fungi assoluti (mushroom dish)
- giuggliolosa (salad - mixed greens, sweet red peppers, pine nuts, honey)

All the apps were delicious- the grilled calamari was nice cooked - not chewy or rubbery at all (there is an option to get fried calamari if you wish).  The mushroom dish was simple but flavorful - baked oyster mushrooms, olive oil, breadcrumbs, balsamic vinegar for that tartness and served on arugula.  

For my main I was intrigued by the Ravioli do Zio Paperone - duck confit ravioli with figs, roasted butternut squash and mushrooms.  This dish sounded better than it tasted - I found it salty unfortunately.  I'm a person that like a little extra salt but I found this a tad too salty for my tastebuds.  The sauce was really good if only the salt could have been toned down a bit.  

My friend chose the braise lamb dish with pasta and dandelions and that was delicious- deep in flavors and not overly gamey (from the lamb).

My other friends had the snapper (I think it might have been the special that night)and both devoured their meals - they said it was really good (I didn't taste it so I couldn't say myself).

The service was excellent- a little slow but the place was pretty packed at one point being NYE so we expected as much.  Our server was lovely and always patient with us when we were decided our meals.  She came back to check on us frequently.  Definitely 5 stars for her (wish I could remember her name).

I would come back and try a few other dishes as I do like the vibe/ambiance here."}
{"text":"I give this a whopping 5 stars for what i feel is a very very valid reason, and here we begin:

My bf's boss invited me to meet them out for dinner at Terroni. Along with them was a lady from their work who was FRESH from Italy 1 month ago, born, bred and raised lol. The reason we went here was because his boss wanted to know (since he loved it so much) if it was actually authentic italian food, made and tastes the way it does in Italy and we had just the right person to critique it. As she browsed the menu she pointed out that the menu stayed true to authentic italian food, but the key was how it tasted. So we got a few apps to start.

first was Tagliere di Formaggi and Tagliere del Salumiere i.e. meats and cheeses. So i am not a fan of olives OR blue cheese, Terroni turned me. The blue cheese they had there was semi-creamy and not to potenant. The olives were fresh, not drenched in juice or oil and stuffed with peppers and such, they were dry, rustic and sweet...absolutely delish. In fact all the cheese was wicked and she even vouched that the presentation was on point and having jelly with your cheese is very common in italy. It was the start to a very delish evening. We then all got pasta and wine and that was it. I had Spaghetti in canna a mare (seafood pasta) and my bf had Pappardelle al Sugo di Cinghiale (boar pasta). They both were so delish and not overloaded with to many flavours. And when it comes to a really good pasta the key is to have it simple, elegant and key flavours stand out. She gave it a 10/10 when it came to capturing the essence and flavours of home grade Italian food. 

The food is frikkin amazing, and the restaurant itself if immaculate. It used to be an old court house and they have kept it really rustic. The bathrooms are in jail cells in the basement and its just really cool to look around in. This place really takes the cake. The crowd is very mixed and to me that goes to show that its not just the rich that enjoy really good food lol"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience here. This time I got the Stefan pizza which has arugula and prosciutto on top. 
There were six of us which at most places means a slightly longer wait for the food, but the food came out very quickly and tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other Terroni locations, this one is nice too.  We were there for brunch, and wanted a patio seat upstairs....  We took a seat at the bar first and grab some brunch-y cocktails and waited to be seated upstairs.  By waited, I mean, I had to go remind the hostess that's what we wanted at 11:30am, then I had to flag down a server to close up our tab, then go ask the hostess again for a table upstairs...so 3 requests?  Ya, that happened.

We were seated upstairs, only to find that brunch wasn't being served upstairs, and we could  only have the lunch menu.  Lunch was fine, because I just wanted a sandwich, but it was totally different from the downstairs menu...something someone should have said.

I ordered the veal sandwich which was good, but the server wouldn't put cheese on my salad, because the cheese is reserved for people who order pasta.  That also happened.

I'm only giving them 3 stars instead of 2 because I had a good time...we were doings a girls brunch/lunch, and the patio is nice.  But What a Bunch of Pretentious whatevers....not exactly a low key vibe.  The service was borderline a 2.  If you want to be treated well, don't come here."}
{"text":"We were here tonight - (4 fabulous girls) - it was my first time at this location, I've been the Queen west location before (where the mushroom salad is totally amazing)...I had been jonesing for it all day...but it was completely lack luster.  (thinly sliced white mushrooms (raw), thinly sliced cheese, and some greens lightly tossed in a vinegrette.  Boo on the mushroom salad.

I had a pizza with pear and honey (yum - yummier than it sounds), the pizzas here are great.  3 of us ordered pizza, and the other the gnocchi (i love gnocchi).

The prosecco bellinis are tasty.

Word of advice - they don't take reservations, and won't seat you until your FULL party arrives.  Try to get there on time..."}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant chain. Yes it is a chain but you wouldn't know that going there. The service is amazing, staff always know a lot about the food and are very attentive. This specific location has the best decor and atmosphere although all of them have a nice atmosphere. They have a passion for serving traditional Italian food. They use all the best imported ingredients which is why the prices are higher than the average pizzeria. Every dish is worth the price as the food is spectacular. Do not ask for substitutions here or to add things to your dish. If you have an allergy they are accommodating but if you want to add balsamic or swap a veggie on your pizza for something else, you will get a dirty look and they will most likely refuse. Most people would not like that but it's a quirk that I find endearing in the effort to stay true to the traditional way of serving Italian food. Reservations are usually needed, not the place to try and walk in to."}
{"text":"The decor is great and recently, the wait seems to be more reasonable. I LOVE the Santo Stephano pizza here. One of my good friends & I have become regulars as a result. Although limited, there are also quick a few good red wine options on the menu. 

I'd say it's one of the closest restaurants to the downtown core worth frequenting."}
{"text":"I remember when I lived in Ontario that I loved Italian food.. then I moved to Vancouver and really tried to eat anything BUT italian... and now that I'm back.... I'm trying to find great pizza all over again.. probably there weren't very authentic pizza places on the west coast.
And I hear from everyone - go to Terroni.. best pizza.
Well I went, and I must just not be a fan or authentic thin crust. When trying to cut it.... it doesn't cut, or takes way too much effort to the point where the pizza is slipping off the plate.. uncut!

The toppings were very tasty - white pizza with speck, pears and a lovely combination of sweet and salty. but the crust just reminded me of cardboard. I know that sounds soo harsh, but it's true.
We also ordered a chacuterie plate to start which was a nice combination of meats, breads, and cheeses, a pear and some honey. Definitely a variety of textures, flavours, and would fit any one's palette (as long as they love meat and cheese).

For dessert, we got the tiramisu to share - because I love tiramisu and have heard great things. For the most part, I was pleasantly pleased. Very creamy, very traditional.

The exterior is very nice and being an old prison, you will see the jails as wine cellars in the basement. A little eerie, but very cool.

I would definitely come back to check out other foods, and yes even give their pizza another try. Their pasta looked good, but then I've been told to go to Mercatto instead. To each person's own I guess."}
{"text":"If you like to be pretentious, and showoff your \"truffles\" than this place is for you.  The people that go to this place and brag about it are the kind that will try to convince you that their bowel movements smell like potpourri.  The food is average, the prices are ridiculous.  I don't mind paying more for real good food.  
I am going to pick a beef of mine and use this restaurant as as example.  Why do people like truffle?  Its a status thing.  If you like truffle you should also enjoy the fungus that accumulates at the crack of your buttocks.   Just harvest it with a spoon and put it on your pasta. It smells the same and i'm sure tastes the same.   Truffle is the most ridiculous overrated food on earth and whoever ordered truffle next to me caused me to lose my appetite.  Perhaps this is why I didn't give this place a 4 star.  Blame the truffle.   What a dumb item.  My seafood pasta for the first 7 minutes was great and cooked properly until the pretentious dude next to us had truffle pasta and couldn't stop talking about it.  You would think he was describing the  feeling he had when he drained his truffles for the first time."}
{"text":"Great spot - friendly service and even better music and ambience- drinks were unique and delicious and food fresh and well presented-  good spot for casual date night, drink with girls or guys - a lot of fun, feels High end but not stiff-"}
{"text":"Terroni is a solid Italian restaurant. The atmosphere and food is great. This location is pretty big so I don't usually make reservations when I come with a small group since it's a pretty short wait time to get a table. 

The food is great. I prefer the pasta over the pizza. Me and two of my friends all ordered the same pasta. 

Food: Tonnarelli alla Norcina 
(Italian black truffle shavings, homemade spicy sausage, pecorino, garlic)

We devoured it as it was really tasty and meaty. More meat than what I expected actually. I was expecting the sausage to be more of a topping, but there was so much meat that the amount was equivalent to the pasta noodles. The food was great however service was lacking. The server we had barely checked up on us. We had to wave her down to get service for water refills. When she came she seemed like she's in a rush. The service was not friendly overall. I hope to receive better service on my next visit."}
{"text":"Best location in my eyes. It had more variety it seemed. Service was great.. glad I made rsvp it's packed usually. Just wish they changed their rules around no sauce with fried calamari."}
{"text":"each terroni is brilliant.  they are similar enough that i think all locations can be reviewed together...ive been there perhaps more than any other restaurant in the city.  i really wanted to add an extra star beyond the five so here goes:      *

somehow that seemed anticlimactic. but the food is not.  ive indulged in lots of pasta - like the garganelli with peas, parm, proscuitto, or even a simple tomato based seafood one; ive never tried one i didnt love.   i usually start with the funghi assoluti which is greens with oyster mushrooms baked with parm, olive oil and balsamic.  sick.  for a pizza try the c't mange (dont even ask me how to pronounce that-just point to it). what you will be tasting is a white pizza with pear, gorgonzola and drizzled with honey.  did i say sickening?  if you are still not sure, just go in there, hang out at the bar, and order a latte and a plate of olives. - this is the creamiest latte in the city -its all because of the homo milk they use. - and the olives are so fresh, tangy, slippery and varied as they should be.

if i had one restaurant to choose forever itd be this one.  booyah."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving this place three stars is because I did enjoy my meal. But I was not impressed with the service whatsoever. Our waitress was not very attentive, the experience felt very rushed and she was not very friendly either. When we were talking to her and making our orders, she was looking away, distracted by what was going on elsewhere. Not very professional. It's a big spot but a little overwhelming and tight. I did enjoy my food but I like the Adelaide location much better.. better space and service."}
{"text":"My favourite one of all the Terroni locations. Big, beautiful space and great service! The food at any Terroni location is consistently very good but I can't say the same about the service and space."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. Service is amazing. Food is indifferent. Pizza had little to taste. Pasta was stodgy and bland. UGH. Too too noisy. Can't imagine why anyone would go there. Can't talk. It's like being at an auction."}
{"text":"The pizza was great, I ordered the one with sausage ( can't remember name ) my group of 5, mostly age 40 and above, sat upstairs which is a bit less noisy. However, the service is super slow and one of the servers preferred to stare at himself in the mirror behind us instead ( checking his hair ) of making eye-contact and being personable.   

I was also early and asked to sit at the bar while the table was prepared and someone would come get me, no one came and got me and instead my companions texted me to ask where I was once they were seated :/

I would go here for the food again, but with very low expectations for any kind of good service."}
{"text":"This was a perfectly decent experience--the entrees and desserts were good. The service was quick and the patio we were served on was adorable. It was just too pricey, however."}
{"text":"Ok, this place has its own magazine. I don't know what their priorities  are and I am sure my review might generate discomfort, and this is what happened.

I arrived early to meet my party. There was only one reservation under the person's name. I was seated down. I waited for 20 minutes and no one came to check on me. While I was waiting, because I was concerned that maybe I was in the wrong spot - I was seated far away from the main dining room, I asked a manager. He checked and said there was no problem.

This didn't sit well with me and I contacted the meetup group inquiring if it had been canceled. I found out they were all seated in a separate table!

When I told the manager this situation, he didn't express any emotion. I was not even escorted to the table. I went to the table because the meetup organizer met me. To my chagrin, they had already ordered. I hated sitting & waiting for 20 min only to later discovered the entire party was seated together and had ordered!

I lost appetite and nothing on the menu seemed appealing. I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese and it was a basic dish.

The emotionless manager saw me as we were settling our individual bills and remarked how I found my group. I explained what happened and told him the hostess made a mistake. She sat me under the reservation but then didn't honour the reservation and seated the others in a different table. He argued with me and told me she did her job and that another member of the party didn't recognize me and so they sat us separately. I told him it was a meetup group and there was a reservation under \"_\". He disregarded that and blamed the other meetup member for not knowing me. It's a meetup group and people don't know each other.

The hostess didn't seat the person in the table under the reservation. She took her elsewhere. And the manager refused to apologize or even express empathy. Instead, he blamed the other meetup person for not recognizing me and ergo it's not their responsibility. It was our fault. The paying customer's fault.

Refusing to take any accountability is a glaring lack of integrity. I am not planning on returning here."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's b-day dinner.  I was surprised that I was not allowed to be seated until half my party showed up. Great. So now, I have to be standing nearby and wait, and chit chat with the others.  It doesn't make business sense to me because if you sit me, and there's another person already waiting, most likely, I will order a drink, be comfortable and have an animated conversation and most likely order another drink during dinner.

*sigh*

Our relationship with the server began with a rocky start. She ignored us. And then only took half the table's drink order!  And then proceeded to ignore us again for a very long pause. I didn't order my drink until I ordered my meal.  After this, however, it improved.

The food itself was delicious. I had the nizzardo salad (tuna and potato) and the pear, walnut and prosciutto pizza.  I shared both salad and pizza with another girl, and it was a smart decision. Salad was too small a plate to share, but the pizza was large enough to share. The combination of pear and prosciutto is one that I strongly enjoy. Plus, the pizza is thin crust, so I was very happy with my meal choices.

However, I am not a fan of their table seating policy and the rocky start of our relationship with the server."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for a friend's birthday party. This place is definitely for the \"younger crowd\" as most people here were 20-35 years old. The interior was gorgeous and had high ceiling all around with chandeliers and even a live dj when I visited. The service time was great for the amount of people in our large group (20 of us). The price at this place can be upwards of at least $30 of a pizza with a drink. The waiter did a great job of checking in on us to make sure our food was okay. However the food was straight poor to mediocre for the price. People in our group ordered a variety of their large selection of pizzas to pasta and we all felt it tasted average. The interior was also dimly lit which made it hard to take pictures for my friend's birthday. There seemed to be many people there who were celebrating their birthday with friends. 

In conclusion if you are looking for pizza or pasta in a fancy interior restaurant while having decent service, I would recommend this place. If you are not looking to spend too much money at a sit down place, there are tons of other places nearby worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from 2 colleagues. I was in the city for a business trip and wasn't a far walk from where I was staying. I arrived around 8:30 and sat at the bar. Deciding on a red wine, most restaurants will offer a taster to make sure you like it. Especially when you're paying $15 a glass. So I went with the recommended wine by the bartender and he said it was full and complex. I found the wine tart like lemon so I asked for something else. Any other restaurant I goto will always offer something else. He did not. He was hesitant .. so i asked for a taster of the pinot and he said we don't do tasters. It's odd given 2 min beforehand I saw the other bartender hand this lady a taster on the other end. Once I pointed that out, the other guy okay it. Weird. I said I don't want to waste another glass of wine in case I didn't like it. Very weird service. 

Onto the food, I saw rave reviews of the Tonnarelli alla Norcina and had to try it. The pasta was al dente perfectly. I can see why some people think it's a bit on the chewy side but that's because everyone else overlooks it. The fresh truffles were fantastic and they weren't shy about it. The spicy sausage wasn't spicy at all however I did find that it overpowered the truffle taste. 

Even with the wine hiccup I would come back for more pasta. The ambiance in the bar area was really nice. Not too hectic but it was a Monday evening. The seat I was in was the \"elbow\" corner. Some workers were cleaning glasses which is fine however every time they got up, they would swing their chair and hit my chair every time. Never said sorry. They were so oblivious to it each time That's a bit rude I'd say. And be more careful when someone's sitting right behind you! 

I give this place a 3.5/5 overall. Not quite a 4.."}
{"text":"Being completely honest, I was not excited to eat here when I found out a friend made a reservation but I was pleasantly surprised. When I looked at the menu beforehand, I was so confused by how authentic it was and wasn't sure what to order -- especially as a picky eater. I really did enjoy the dinner though! 

Atmosphere wise, it's a cool place with some unique decorations. I feel like you could dress casual or formal and have many different dinners here. We went for a bachelorette dinner. We had a group of 11 and had fabulous service. 

After struggling on what to order, I ended up getting the gnocchi alla simi and I loved it. Originally I thought the portion seemed really small (coming from an American where plates are supposed to be bigger than our heads!) but it turned out to be a great size. I finished the whole thing happily. The meal also included a free bread appetizer. It was decent enough bread but nothing special. I also split a bottle of wine with a friend (the Rosato) and it was delicious. 

All in all, it was a good restaurant and even the pickiest waters should be able to find something. You just may have to step out of your comfort zone!"}
{"text":"Terroni I love you. You are very good to me. Always feeding me delicious pastas and pizzas, trying to get me fatter. I can't hate you for that, you're just doing what you do best. You're only fault is you don't take reservations and think you are too good for it so you make people wait a very long time.

This location is one of my favorites because its an old courthouse. It's pretty cool inside. The bathrooms are downstairs and on your way there, you can view the wine cellars that used to be overnight jail cells. One of the cells are actually used for private dining on busy nights. Upon entering the double glass doors you are welcomed with a gigantic bar with lots of wines, extremely high ceilings, and contemporary but rustic decor. 

Luckily this bar is at the doorway since they don't take reservations it can take some time before you get a table. Across from the bar there is the antipasti prep station. It's cool to see them prep the in house cured prosciutto. 

The service is pretty fast and the waitstaff are very knowledgeable. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food that gets dished out. There is one long communal table here so if you have an issue sitting beside a stranger let the hostess know but for the most part the people at the communal table are up for talking and are pretty relaxed. 

Overall everything on the menu is fantastic. The grilled calamari is done perfectly. Dessert is very good. Bottles of wine are reasonably priced. You get good value for your money here and the service is quick. If you come after 6pm be prepared to wait a long time... a very long time as this place gets packed."}
{"text":"The entrance to this place threw me off.  Call me a neophyte, but when you list your address as Yonge, I expect your main door to be on Yonge.  Anyhow, we were recovered and seated on the new second floor of what is now a full-out Terroni, not just the Bar Centrale spinoff.

My guest and I enjoyed a tasty meal in an average-noise-level atmosphere.  This was a decent spot for people-watching, and service was good.  The seafood was fresh and well-prepared, and the pasta was cooked al dente with a sauce that didn't strike me as overpowering.

Nonetheless, as you may have surmised from my vagueness, two weeks out of my reservation and the food is not the first thing I remember.

I would go again if I were looking for a nice evening out with a couple of friends.  The food was good, the wine was good, the ambience was good.  It's not a place to go if you're trying to save your pennies, or if you're looking for the meal of your life, though."}
{"text":"Been to this resto so many times I can't even count. Great food. Good service. A perfect place for an informal night out."}
{"text":"For a party of 5, with appetizers, main dishes, dessert, coffee, booze, etc., the bill is pretty stiff.  To the point where for a few extra bucks, I'd rather go eat at Scaramouche, where I'm guaranteed great service, unbelievable food, unbeatable ambiance, and where I'm not wanting to go home and drink barrels of water to quench my overly salted and parched throat."}
{"text":"I can't help it, but this place has THE BEST thin crust pizza in Toronto - and the closest semblance to pizza in Italy.  I'm in heaven each time I have their pizza and although it appears they've raised their prices on all items, I still adore the pizza.  And the cute guy who tosses the dough behind the clear glass partition is a real pro.  The Balmoral location is moving down the road to further south of Yonge Street & Roxborough(?) in January 2011, so get your fix south of St. Clair now.  Side note - I've had pizza from Ferraro (most recently - yuck), that fancy place on Ossington (name escapes me at the moment - it was fine but not amazing nor memorable), Cafe Nervosa, etc., and I tell you, Terroni knows how to do pizza."}
{"text":"WOOHOO! Amazing pizza place (But Queen Margarita still has my heart  :D). 

I came here for lunch with a friend. They have a cute wooden setting theme going on and I recommend getting a window seat. 

I had gotten the Al Salmone pizza ($19) and it was sooooo good. I absolutely love thin crust pizza, and the best part was that they layered the salmon on. I wasn't too much of a fan of the capers as they were a bit too salty for my liking, but otherwise it was amazing. 


My friend had gotten the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare ($20) but I was meh about it. It didn't seem like there was much of the seafood going on, more of the pasta part which I'm not too much of a fan of. I guess lucky I wasn't the one having it haha. 

Overall, it was a good place. But there will be another pizza place in my heart (Queen Margarita) and even then, this will only be the second runner up (after Pizzeria Libretto which makes an EXCELLENT thin crust pizza). 

The service was decent, but nothing that stood out too much. Overall everything was just what this rating was.. A-OK. Wasn't bad, but I've had better."}
{"text":"One of the few authentic Italian restaurants in the city. Intimate, good layout, and great for birthdays or private groups. The Tagliere di Fromaggi could be a meal in itself - great selection of cheeses. Pastas are well-portioned but not overly filling. I have yet to try anything other than the flourless chocolate cake for dessert, as it's just too good to pass up."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the arrogance and pretentiousness exhibited by this restaurant really annoyed me.

The server kept going on about how they are a certain type of Italian restaurant so they don't serve balsamic with their bread, then she proudly went on about how there was no pizza knife in the restaurant.  Good for you, now leave me alone while I rip up my pizza with my bare hands."}
{"text":"Good Italian restaurant with great service!! :) It was actually our back up plan since the first Thai restaurant we were gonna go was closed for NYE dinner. But it turned out to be so much better than our expectation!! Great Pizza and Pasta!!!! And Salad and desert!! lol"}
{"text":"For appetizers, we ordered Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo, which had Italian meats and cheese with bread on the side. It was yummy! The bread-sticks paired well with the two.

I ordered Ravioli di Zio Paperone as my main dish (homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano). The first few raviolis were really good but then the taste became bland afterwards. I thought the pasta was way too oily. 
If I come here again, I'll probably order something else. 

Service was okay. 

Also, for those who love balsamic vinegar with their bread, this place doesn't offer it - our server told us they're not allowed to serve it because their olive oil that comes with the bread is supposed to be really good..?"}
{"text":"I do not understand why people rave about this place all the time... I've ate there on a few occasions and I thought it was good, but people make it sound like it's the best damn restaurant in Toronto.

I am a pasta freak. I eat that stuff like it's no tomorrow and when it comes to pasta I have probably ate at about 15-20 places in the city better than Terroni. I admit that last time I went I had this fantastic tuna salad but it cost about ten dollars and I could have made that at home for about three bucks.

I can never quite understand why there's always a line-up to get into this place, but to each their own. If you go you will likely enjoy it even though a plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce costs about twelve dollars. They make their own fresh pasta though, so I guess that's a plus."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service. Packed, it was Friday night. They have very spacious 2 levels. The service was personal and warm. We weren't hungry so we only had one Pasta, which wasnt as good as expected. I felt that the Pasta was fresh but the overall dish was a let down. It was called the Arcobaleno."}
{"text":"Terroni is one of the few restaurants in the city I am willing to line up for a table.  I've been to all the different locations in Toronto but the Queen West location remains my favorite.  You won't have the best meal of your life here but the food will be delicious and you'll have a great time.  We never feel rushed and I just love how chill and relaxed it is. It's definitely a great place to have dinner with friends and catch up!

I usually order something from the special of the day menu and I don't mind the no substitution rule since they have a pretty large menu so you're bound to find something you like!  I am not sure about their bar situation as they don't have gin but I'll get over it."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've given such a low rating. Lots of people seem to like this place so be sure to read other comments, this is just based off my experience. 

First off, it's busy here which is a great sign, but keep reading. Start off with bread which comes with chili in a dish and olive oil. If you ask for vinegar, a very quiet server may respond with ,\"we don't serve vinegar. But I can bring you salt and pepper\".... 

Carpaccio comes first and the cut is really thick and lumpy! I'm thinking I just gotta spread it out but no, it's actually one giant sheet of beef with veins still visibly stuck. There's not enough greens on there for a satisfying bite but I'm glad they atleast shower it with the shredded parmesan. Tastes like carpaccio but just thicker, all one piece and no greens... I'm thinking it's okay, but I wish they would change the price to reflect what you'll be served.  

Then comes the pizza and pasta. Pizza looks great to start and it's thin crust, plenty of greens and prosciutto. My fave! But the tomato sauce was not really there and the mozzarella was horrible! It has a watery texture and didn't taste like anything... By the way, be prepared to slice your own pizza... But that's not the worst.

Do not order their spinach tortalloni with ricotta stuffing in the butter sage sauce. Apparently, not the first time they have served pasta that just isn't done cooking... Really chewy and on the edges, even hard. The stuffing was the most unappetizing part of the meal. It was so watery that everytime I took a bite, the cheese would squeeze some gross water out and over all it tastes like nothing... 

Servers don't care, food is seriously over charged, and default tip is set at 18%. 

Don't come here for Italian food. There's too many other amazing places to put your hard earned money.
Then again...they get tons of people and good reviews so they must do something good."}
{"text":"This location is much bigger than the downtown location.  I came here for a ladies night with a big group of friends and they had us on the 3rd floor in a small room at no extra cost.  They didn't split the bills - but we knew that coming in - but they did allow us to put however much we wanted amongst different cards or cash.

Food is the same.  Decent number of options - but make sure there is something on the menu you like b/c there are NO substitutions.  While I have always found something on the menu I like, that definitely takes a star off for me b/c they go a little overboard in my opinion (i.e. no removing something that a customer is allergic too).  That qualm aside, I have always liked my meal and the portions are perfect.  

Service was great, as usual."}
{"text":"Very well trained and knowledgeable staff. The food is fantastic, and the wine selection is good. I recommend the roof top most of all."}
{"text":"We weren't too sure about this place, because it doesn't look fancy, it's kind of loud, and the tables are very close together.

But as soon as we tasted our appetizers, we knew we were in for a treat. The food here is absolutely fantastic! Easily the best Italian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Have been twice to this restaurant in a month - great food and a very great ambience with the building being an old court house (the toilets are the holding cells that used to temporarily have prisoners or convicted people in). In both instances the servers were very friendly and extremely knowledgeable of their menus and specials - giving out recommendations when asked. I was with a party of 4 so we had the carpaccio to share along with the calamari - both were great and \"spot on\". My main course was a pizza Veloce (button mushroom) which again was up to my tastebuds expectations. And lastly I ordered the flourless chocolate \"lava cake\" with ice cream (the ice cream was a separate order which was sort of a bummer cause you'd expect them to go together) - the desert was great too. So all in all a 5 star for me."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. Pizza was delicious and octopus appetizer is a must have. Good wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Terrific restaurant.  First thing you notice upon entering is the dramatic space.  It's an old courthouse that's been expertly restored, and it's a lovely space.  

Of course that wouldn't help unless the food was good too.  I had the Garganelli Gepetto, which was a pasta with sausage, two cheeses, and dandelion leaves, of all things.  The leaves had a slight bitterness which balanced the sausage nicely.  My companion raved about his choice also. 

Wine list was impressive but entirely Italian in origin, but that's now problem as the selection is diverse.  I found a glass I liked.  Only  quibble is that the wine servings were expensive and quite small; I think it was supposed to be three ounces but looked almost like it could have been two.  

All in all, an excellent choice.  Will go again."}
{"text":"Being a huge pizza fan i definitely had to check out Terroni since i heard good things about it and it was listed as one of the best pizzas on BLOGTO. 

I personally prefer the real deal pizza and that is proper Italian pizza over the regular pizza you can get from a fast food or casual dining place so i have to say i was pretty excited.When i visited Terroni i sat on the patio , what i liked the most is the fact that it wasnt too crowded which made me quite enjoy my meal in a pleasant atmosphere.

Out came the bread first along with some chilli spread and olive oil. I thought the bread was fantastic , it had a fluffy bread filling with the perfect amount of crispness from the crust and the chili spread made it that much perfect !!! I tried my best not to devour the whole thing.

For my pizza i opted for the Pizza Cosí which consisted of
tomato, porcini mushrooms, mozzarella, fontina and prosciutto di parma. 

It was served piping hot ,the cheese was melted perfectly which made it quite hard to eat at the start. The dough had a crispy crust with the rest of the pizza being slightly doughy but doughy in a good way which made it easy for one to eat it folded. The pizza overall was delicious however only thing i would say is that the ham to mushroom ratio was sad , if they put more porcini mushrooms and a little less ham i would have given it a 10/10. The amount of ham on the pizza was a bit too much for me because of the saltiness from the meat. 

Another thing i would have liked is for the pizza to be sliced because cutting took a bit of effort which in turn eventually made the pizza quite cold by the time i was done eating.

Overall , great pizza and i would probably visit again"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Italian must dine affordable joint, since opening in the 90's and being a tiny little trendy restaurant that you were never sure would last or grow, until you tasted the awesomeness of the food. 

Quality has never been compromised and anything I've ever had, I enjoy. The grilled calamari, is the bar I use when eating calamari anywhere worldwide. Not sure how they make a grilled Cali so well, but it's incredible. 

Personally I love the San Giorgio pizza, but everyone who orders a pasta or anything else, raves love for it. 

Terroni may not be the latest hot spot, or not the place to be seen, but that's fine with me. It's about the food, and getting a consistently well cooked meal that delivers what you expect when ordering Italian. So enjoy, dig in and be ready to visit again and again and again."}
{"text":"Went to Terroni on a Thursday night. It was busy but we were able to get a table no problem. 

Had the duck confit ravioli and affogato for dessert. The ravioli was super. My favourite part was the mushrooms. It was advertised as having butternut squash and figs , but I did not detect these flavours whatsoever. 

The atmosphere was lively and lovely

The service was seamless

The dessert ( gelato with espresso and chocolate) was the perfect light and refreshing  end to the meal. 

It is a perfect place to go if you find yourself downtown and craving carbs!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food for such ridiculous prices, ridiculous rules and ridiculous service. I have never been to a restaurant that has told me why and how I have to order my food because we don't do this and you shouldn't order it like that and no we can't sub this and no we can't add that blah blah blah blah blah, they refused to give us balsamic vinegar to go with our bread because they want to keep the authenticity of their olive oil, oh wow that's cool... well can I get some please I like my bread and olive oil with balsamic vinaigrette .. \"No we don't do such a thing... our olive oil is from Italy... CONGRATULATIONS TERRONI *clap clap clap* get over yourself."}
{"text":"A very large, yet cozy, dim-light space. Pretty busy after 6pm.  Italian is usually hit-or-miss for me, but I think this one is a good choice. 

To start: 

Complimentary bread - cold and hard crust. Expected better. 

Potato croquettes - deep fried with potato and proscuitto. The croquette was nice and hot, soft, fluffy creamy potato inside with a crisp coating. Could not taste proscuitto though. Good with the pesto sauce. 

Carpaccio - always one of my favorites, this was thin and good texture. 

Mains: 

C't Mang Pizza - as per recommendations on Foursquare, I opted for this white pizza with mozzerella, gorgonzola, pear, walnuts, proscuitto and honey. It is a fairly light pizza. Crust is super thin, which I like, but it wasn't served hot enough. Cheese was a bit hard and not melt-y (maybe that's due to the type of cheese) and it could use more walnuts, honey and pear to make the flavors stand out more. My favorite part was the proscuitto - flavorful but not overly salty. 

Pappardelle with spicy sausage, peas, mushrooms, etc. - inticed by the homemade sausage, this was crumbled finely like minced pork and was not spicy. I like the homemade pasta itself - not too thick or thin and cooked to al dente but not hard. A light tomato oil-based sauce. 

Dessert: 

Creme Caramel - this was great, not too hard, not too soft - just perfect in between texture with hint of egg and caramel sweetness, topped with a sweet coffee-caramel sauce. 

Tiramisu - lots of cream, the sponge part is on the dry side, and no alcohol taste (more like chocolate). My dad enjoyed this. 

Service was decent. 

Overall, with a glass of wine, $100. Decent Itailan food; the best would probably be potato croquette and the creme caramel."}
{"text":"All I can say is Holy Moly!

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, and the food was absolutely amazing! I ordered the wild boar pappardelle and my tongue and mouth were singing. Oh my god it was so good, and the portions were so awesome.

Heck yeah I'd come back!

The only thing is we went on a Monday night, and this place was packed. The tables were super scrunched together, but they did make it work. The only thing is that due to the large crowd, it wasn't as romantic as I would have liked for a birthday dinner, but you know, you can't have it all!

Oh, I almost forgot! Their tea was extremely weak. The menu made it sound like it would be very flavorful, but I didn't like it at all. They should definitely add more tea leaves to the bag or something. Also, the tea pot was horribly designed. You couldn't even pour the tea into the cup because the handle was scalding hot. I had to take my napkin to pour it, and even then it was still hot. Also, the tea was on the back of the dessert menu. I didn't even realize there was a back except by chance. Also, if we didn't ask to see the dessert menu, we wouldn't have even seen that there was tea available. My personal suggestion is that they should improve their tea, and if the customers say they don't want dessert, the waiter should offer tea. There's huge potential here!"}
{"text":"Like some of the people here, I don't understand the big fuss over this restaurant. It is overpriced for what they serve. I ordered duck confit ravioli for $20 and there were less than 10pcs in an order. Seriously??? My girlfriend had the salmon panini and she said it was pretty much pedestrian. Service is good though quite slow on a saturday morning (11am) so I added a second star for this one."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, decent service.
Had the duck ravioli which was quite good, the filling was nice but the sauce could've been more flavourful and substantial. My friend had the truffle pasta which was okay as well, the pasta had a nice bite to eat.
Had the chocolate torte for desert and that was quite good as well.
The pasta was a good portion size for me, not too much pasta so that you feel too full.
All in all good food and good atmosphere and decently priced."}
{"text":"By the strong word-of-mouth, I was expecting nothing short of amazing. However, after waiting over an hour for a table (no reservations), it was bound to disappoint.

The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't amazing either. I had the buffalo mozzarella pizza (the standard by which I measure all pizzerias) and it was a little lacking. Literally lacking in buffalo mozzarella. In fact, everyone's pizzas at the table were deficient in toppings. Yes, the prices here look decent, but considering the lack of substance, I find it quite overpriced. 

By most accounts, however, the homemade pasta is a bigger success. Just am not sure yet if I will take the time to go back and see for myself."}
{"text":"Always amazing - even with toddlers (early in, early out). The food is expensive, but great. It is always good, especially brunch."}
{"text":"The pizza \"looks\" good, but the crust was very dry - barely edible.  The mighty have fallen."}
{"text":"They have a vegan menu available if you ask (and a gluten free menu on the reverse side).

Don't get the vegan pastas -- the portions are way way too small and the flavor was only about a 3-star.

If you are hungry, stick with the pizza and take the risk of getting somewhere between a 1-star and 4-star pie.  Terroni's is very inconsistent.

Overall, I recommend skipping them completely."}
{"text":"Awesome experience, in the backing a warm summer evening I almost felt like I was in Italy. A bit expensive but it's a really nice place."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and this used to be one of my favorite restaurants. But now the music is so loud that people are literally screaming across the table during their meals and we actually couldn't even hear ambulance sirens going by the windows. My dinner guests and I couldn't have a conversation and couldn't wait to get out of there. Nightmare."}
{"text":"Terroni needs to get over itself.

My husband and I came in over the weekend for dinner and we left wishing we'd grabbed fast food instead.

After scouring the menu I decided to order the shrimp and asparagus fettuccine, which has a \"light yellow tomato sauce\", and my husband went with an eggplant pizza. I was originally eyeing another pasta dish but it had a long paragraph under it that said they didn't put parmesan on that particular dish so I didn't order it and went with the fettuccine instead. 

Once our food arrives I asked for some parmesan. NOT ALLOWED. I was told it is one of their \"Famous policies\" in order to \"bring out the natural flavours of the seafood\". 

Just hold it right there, if a restaurant has a \"famous policy\" about telling grown adults what they can and cannot have on the plate they are paying for then said restaurant needs to step back already. This is not a michelin-starred restaurant, not even close.
Not to mention this \"famous policy\" wasn't listed anywhere on their menu except for underneath that one pasta dish. I was actually in disbelief he was telling me I could not have it. Charge me extra, whatever, but to say I am *not allowed* to put parm on *my* dinner? Which I am paying 20 dollars for?

I also need to state right now that, while I am originally from Toronto, I now reside in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY, one of the most thoroughly old-school pure Italian Brooklyn neighbourhoods in New York City, luckily still untouched by ironic mustachio'd Williamsburg influence. If any Italian restaurant in my neighbourhood tried to pull something so ridiculous they'd be shut down by angry Brooklynites in a matter of days.

Once the server disappeared upstairs to never be seen again, my husband began hacking at his pizza with a butterknife because Terroni doesn't cut their pizza either. 


I took a bite of my pasta and didn't even like it. The pasta was floppy and sad, and the mint and chiles overpowered the non-existant \"sauce\". I stopped after 3 small bites  and waited for someone to come back around so I could order something else. It would be a while, with my husband fumbling through 3/4 of his pizza before anyone swung by.

I sent the dish back and got the only non-seafood/parm-permissible pasta that even remotely appealed to me: plain spaghetti and red sauce.  As the server dropped it off he incredulously asked \"would you like cheese on THIS?\". Yes, I would. Thanks. My husband told him that while he understood it was not the server's personal policy, he found it ridiculous and had never heard of such a thing between living in Bay Ridge or Bensonhurst (even more Italian than Bay Ridge) for 7 years,he'd never experienced such a \"rule\" without at the very least giving the patron a heads-up.

The server told us that the restaurant is full every night and that the owner would rather lose customers than \"compromise the integrity of the food\". Is the owner unaware of the fact that Terroni is a chain? I used to work for Cosimo Mamolitti's brother's tile company before Terroni was a \"thing\". Terroni catered this company's first staff party and it was great then! It's a shame it's become such a needlessly pretentious place. 

Regardless of the owner's idea of the integrity of his chain restaurant food, the food itself was not worth the price. I am an avid cook and food is my main passion in life, and I have had years of experience in the restaurant industry.
 My husband on the other hand knows how to cook exactly one dish, and he commented on the sloppy presentation and poor execution of his pizza. If he noticed it, it must have been bad. The eggplant was certainly not salted because it was chewy and mushy, half-hazardly thrown on the pizza in too-large slices which made it difficult to eat. 
Sick of the attitude and disappearing server act, we scarfed our food down, paid the bill and still tipped well, and got the HELL out of there.

I always thought part of a great restaurant, besides great food, is a good customer experience. Don't make your customers feel Less Than. I left disheartened and frustrated and like we'd wasted a bunch of money. I left feeling judged by the waitstaff. 

Save your money and go find an authentic mom-and-pop Italian joint that will treat you like a human being."}
{"text":"This location is my favourite amongst all the other locations. I have tried different pasta dishes and pizzas here but Margarita pizza and Tonnarelli alla norcina Pasta are my top choices. The Olive oil they serve is simply the best!! The Aperol Negroni is my summer drink. So refreshing. Love love the rooftop patio."}
{"text":"We went to Terroni for a friend's birthday, but I was really disappointed with the food. The only thing bumping it to two stars is the service. The waitresses that served us are very nice and attentive, also tries their best to accommodate our large group size.

I ordered a peach ice tea to start, and eventually ordered a soup as an appetizer and a basic spaghetti as my entree.

The peach ice tea was really good! Light to the taste and not overly sweetened. Well, it was not made from the bar, it came in a can...best efforts on Terroni's part for having this drink!

Now soup. I found out, they only had one soup on the menu (I believe it was a squash soup of some sort), so I ordered that. It was really salty and I had to chug water to get it down.

I was looking forward to the spaghetti and I was thoroughly disappointed. The sauce was salty and I was only able to take a few bites out of it. 

So I tried some of my friends' spaghetti dishes. Apparently all of us thought the sauce was salty, no matter which spaghetti we ordered. At the end of the night, the only dish we liked was one friend's steak dish with kale if I recall correctly.

Maybe it's just us having a personal preference of more of a plain food, but I will avoid this place from now on if I can."}
{"text":"Solid Italian. A bit cramped. Good wine list, Italian meat plate, pizzas and the meat plate entree is good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food time and time again. I wish I could be invincible and eat here every day. All of their locations are consistent and beautifully put together in their own way. 

I particularly like the Adelaide location given its history. Definitely check out the vaults in the basement."}
{"text":"Terroni's is one of the first restuarants that we went to when we first moved to Toronto, based on feedback from our friends who live here. I have nothing bad to say about the place. The place is busy but it didn't take longer then 15 minutes for us to get in. The dining room is casual and just a fun diining experience but if you're there during the summer, try and get seated on the patio. 
As for the food, I was in love! The pizzas are large and taste amazing. I have been to a lot of well known pizza joints in NY and Chicago but Terroni's is my favorite so far. 
If you are in Toronto for a visit be sure to check them out. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to Terroni on Queen Street West and love it! I love the ambience and the decor - perfect for dates or hangout sesh. Busy and lively, but not too loud for conversations. 

For appetizer, I had the Margherita pizza for appetizer which I thought was okay, but nothing too fantastic. I had the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare for my main course. I thought it was okay and had decent amount of seafood and fantastic flavour - but again, nothing spectacular. 

I also tried the Butterscotch pudding for dessert, I can only take a bite out of it - it was too rich and sweet! 

I'll definitely consider coming back and try out other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food, great service and the old courthouse truly is an amazing place!"}
{"text":"My brother really wanted to have some good Italian food considering the fact that he came to visit us from Hong Kong. He was getting a bit sick of all the Asian food we were having when he came back.

There were two stipulations among my family:
1) Non-Asian food
2) No waiting (my dad hates waiting in line for food)
3) Cheap
4) Good parking

I was trying to think of a place to eat that evening - and I was really craving Terroni (on Adelaide). Luckily, I found out that there was a new Terroni opened near Rosedale, that had AMPLE seating, takes reservations via OpenTable AND has a great parking lot down the street.

Hurray!

My family and I ordered the following: 
1) RAVIOLI DI ZIO PAPERONE: Absolutely delicious -- the duck confit was to die for.
2) (Another pasta dish that was on the specials, sorry!)
3) SMENDOZZATA: Good, but nothing TOO amazing (my parents were a bit annoyed with the fact that the pizza wasn't cut for us already, but that's just how Terroni rolls.
4) AFFOGATO: THIS IS MY FAVOURITE DESSERT OF ALL TIME. I still don't know anywhere else that makes amazing affogato as Terroni. I'm a little sad that I don't have it right now.
5) PANNA COTTA: We ordered this for my parents, considering they didn't want something TOO sweet. They loved it! 

Service was awesome too. Our waitress was always very joyful and great every time she came by. I also noticed that there was LOTS of space here -- there was also a party going on in the back area. Definitely would suggest to come here if you're with a group or something as well."}
{"text":"Dear Terroni:
You make delicious food.
Sincerely, Joanne

We were here for my friend's farewell that evening -- we had booked a table for 25 (yes! we got reservations) -- at 9 PM.  The great thing is this: no set menu required.

My friend and I had ordered the following:
CALAMARI ALLA GRIGLIA:  absolutely delicious -- calamari was grilled to perfection and the salad with the bruschetta was awesome as well.

C'T MANG PIZZA: pears on a pizza?! what?!  AMAZING.  It was a \"sweet\" pizza - but everything complimented each other sooo very well.  The bad part of the pizza at Terroni is that you would have to cut it up yourself (and I'm not very strong).

RAVIOLI DI RICOTTA DI BUFALA: Ravioli with delicious basil and ricotta cheese?! Yes please!

Great evening - great service.  I think the only problem was that it was pretty noisy - but you can't really do much if you have 25 people sitting at one long table."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I'm sort of biased because I love pasta. But I enjoyed everything that I had at this place. I ordered the gnocchi special that they had for Wednesdays and it was really yummy, not like the average gnocchi you get at Pickle Barrel or other general restaurants; it was truly well made. My friend and I also had the grilled calamari which was so good, but keep in mind that it comes on a bed of greens and you'll have to cut it up if you plan on sharing it. Our entrees took awhile to come, about 45 min, so if you're impatient or really hungry I wouldn't recommend coming here lol. The seating outside is pleasant during good weather. And the pricing on the menus is fair, I would say. Will definitely come back for a second try!"}
{"text":"Always so delicious every time I go. Obsessed with the hot peppers they serve the starter bread basket with, and they make a killer Bellini as well. They also have gluten free and vegan menus if you ask your server!"}
{"text":"I ate at Terroni a couple of times and each time was near perfection.  Be aware that reservations are ALWAYS a good idea since Terroni can get busy on a whim.  It is by far one of the best eateries in Queen West.  Everything I ordered was perfect.  I am an Italian food fanatic and was impressed with Terroni.  The summers offer an amazing outdoor patio and cool vibe.  The service is excellent and the staff is friendly and seem very devoted to ensuring your experience makes you happy."}
{"text":"I LOVE everything about this restaurant. I've been here more than a few times and they never let me down. The food is always delicious and the atmosphere is perfect. Best appetizer in my opinion - the fried zucchini flowers (if they have them) and for a main course I cannot get enough of the 'Tagliatelle alla Bolognese' (Traditional bolognese ragù, parmigiano). I'm not much of a dessert person, but I can never say no to their Tiramisu. OMG"}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely, great for catching up with friends.

We ate:
- Caprese salad (5/5) Fresh, delicious. The tomatoes are tossed in a basil/olive oil marination.
- White pizza with real smoked salmon (5/5) Yes, Yelp was right. Best pizza Ive had in Toronto so far. The crust was crispy and light. SO fresh.
- A suggested bottle of wine (5/5) I dont remember the name, makes me sad.

I will be back to try more food so that I can give this resto a 5 star rating!

nom."}
{"text":"Great dining spot with adequate seating.  The grand decor and its successful establishment at Adelaide makes it a must go for Italian cuisine in Toronto.

There are 'better', more affordable, even more extravagant bistros in the city, but none of them can really find the right balance like Terroni on Adelaide does.  The bar upstairs is just an awesome spot as well!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! I honestly wasn't expecting the food to be filling because it looked like such a small portion but it was filling and didn't feel too heavy after the meal. I usually don't like eating pasta because I feel like I get super tiered afterwards but not in this case the pasta was light and filling without the bad feeling afterwards. The waiter was super friendly and helped explain everything well on the menu. He made sure that my ravioli didn't have meat when he came out because I told him I don't eat meat which was really nice of him. Everyone really enjoyed their meals.. Definitely be back net time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went to this delicious Italian gem for Family Day. Fried calamari was an impressive reminder of NYC. The gnocchi special with burrata cheese was as good as mom's (better) ~.^ Dangerous to the waistline good food, great atmosphere a definite go to for Italian food."}
{"text":"I agree that this place borders on five star if it weren't for the sometimes pretentious attitude that manifests itself in various ways. This part is bull sh*t: \"... out of respect for our Italian gastronomy - and our grandparents - we maintain a no modifications, no substitutions policy.\" Guess what? This isn't Italy, it's not 1925, and this place should be catering to its guests - not forcing them to conform to the chefs own personal taste. If I want salt, give me some damn salt! 

I was also notified of their \"guidelines\" several different times - once live over the phone when making the reso and then again through email (twice) and voicemail messages. Listen, I get it, you have rules. I don't need to be told 6 times. Even again in person, the server told me about the no seperate cheque rule. 

The guildelines:
Seating area will be determined upon arrival. 
There is a 15 minute hold on seating at our location, please arrive on time. 
Set menus or pre-ordered appetizers are requested on groups of 20 or more in order to best accommodate & serve your guests. 
We do not allow outside food/cakes or beverages. 
We can provide a cake for your special event booked in advance. 
We are not able to provide separate cheques however, multiple forms of payment are accepted. 
Please advise us if there are any Accessibility Concerns. 
There is an 18% gratuity on groups of 6 or more (private dining room gratuity is 20%). 

Having said all that, I love the food and atmosphere -- it's located in an old courthouse. 

On my recent visit, I had the calamari, duck confit ravioli and tiramisu - all good. Server was ok - again, attitude bordered on pretentious. We were a group of 10 and all enjoyed it. Service was prompt. (Another favourite of mine is the pappardelle with peas and sausage.) Might try the Queen location next time."}
{"text":"oh, Terroni! If only you were anything like the Terroni in Los Angeles! 

Yes, there is a wait, and it doesn't bother me if I am in good company and I can sip on a glass of wine while I wait. However, the DJ music made the atmosphere feel so clubby and douchy! 

The food was just OK, and the olive oil poured for dipping was rancid! Our waitress wasn't very attentive either, but I blame the management for this. They should have had at least one more waiter in our section, she was totally sweet but literally all over the place!"}
{"text":"Terroni is an old faithful. It's a reliable choice for a work lunch (especially if you're a big group), a common choice when looking for a \"safe\" dinner spot for a group of friends (safe meaning its menu can potentially cater to multiple taste palates), and where the food isn't half bad. I've been to this Adelaide location many times over the last year and while it has its faults, it has a nice, flexible ambiance that can cater to meals with co-workers or groups of friends or a dinner date. And is, as a result, a reliable option.

First, parking. If you're coming for dinner, there's a lot just a block north along Church Street, where it's $4.00 after 4:00 PM. There's also street parking along Toronto Street just west of the restaurant.

Second, the ambiance. Classy but still casual. Lighting is very dim for dinner. Service has been fine on all my visits, but note that you should make a reservation, even on weekdays, as they tend to get busy at lunch and with an after-work crowd.

Third, the food. In all honesty, the food can be a hit or miss, but overall, it's fine. There are both \"safe\" choices and more authentic options for the adventurous. I've had their pizzas before, and recently had a couple of their pastas (their Tagliatelle alla Bolognese and their Pappardelle alla Iosa, which was spicy sausage with veggies in extra virgin olive oil). Their pizzas and pastas are both just fine - although on some visits, I found their pastas to be a bit watery. I prefer ordering their pizzas over the pastas, as I find they're tastier.

Overall, I don't really come here for an exhilarating foodie experience - personally, the food doesn't knock my socks off. However, Terroni's reliability, decent variety and menu, and ability to accommodate bigger groups, makes it a \"safe\" and convenient choice for a variety of occassions, which probably means I'll be back again."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous patio! I've been here before and it's always a good meal but last night was a particular treat- I'd never eaten outside on their patio and it was just delightful! 

Dinner was great! The caprese salad was so fresh and my rigatoni was perfectly cooked! My friend had a pizza he just loved with tuna, capers, and red onion.  It did take some time to flag down a server for a 2nd glass of wine but otherwise, everything was great!"}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner here tonight to celebrate a recent birthday.  

This was my first time at this Terroni location, having been to the Summerhill location where both the food and quality of the service was fantastic. 

Aside from the beautiful historic building and great decor, all else was pretty lackluster. 

I'm not quite sure what waiters do here aside from explaining the menu and taking your order. They brought water (sparkling and tap) but just placed the bottles on the table without pouring. Other staff brings the food and removes the empty plates...not much waiting on customers  checking to see that we were content.

Probably the most bothersome thing was the volume of the music (at least on the found floor). We didn't come to eat in a club...we came to have some good food and have some good conversation. Not possible to converse without almost yelling (and we are young with good hearing). We saw a DJ on the way out...hadn't even realized that anyone was mixing....the loud songs seemed to come one after the other. Just a pointless extravagance in a restaurant trying to be too cool.

While we didn't have to sit at the tables which are too close together for comfort and our booth was lovely, the seats had lots of crumbs on them. Not a good first impression upon sitting down.

Food was \"just okay\" this time in comparison to my Summerhill experiences. For appetizers we had the octopus with chickpea puree and the funghi.  The octopus was delicious but not enough pieces for four of us. The fughi was nothing special. ..just some fried oyster mushrooms on a much larger bed of green. 

For mains two of us ordered the daily  pasta special with albacore tuna, capers, black olives, cherry tomatoes and two pieces of shrimp. The tuna bits seemed overcooked and the dishes arrived to the table cold-ish.  Quantity was good and the linguine itself was very good. The others had the dandelion pasta and the marinara. No one was impressed...more like disappointed because everyone's pasta tasted really good at the other Terroni location - here it was just average.

Service was okay. Our server was sweet but inattentive. Other tables that arrived after us were given bread before us and we had to wait long in-between speaking with her. Checking in with clients should be better prioritized during busy times. (We were seated around 8pm when it was a full house).

I'm glad to have checked out this courthouse location - it is beautiful - but it'll be a while before we return. Maybe when we lose some hearing and yelling to each other at the table comes more naturally."}
{"text":"I ask my buddy... where should we go for a birthday? He says Terroni. I ask the concierge where should I take my friend for his birthday? He says: Terroni.  I ask a woman at the department store for a birthday dinner suggestion, she says what do you think??? She said keg. 

So what should I do? I choose to make reservation at Terrori. 
A magnificent choice if I do say! Table for six on the fly from the balcony up on the third floor. It overlooks the main dining room. And it was a great view. We got to choose from many different pizzas and entrées. Many of the pizzas they have on the menu, Dave will not alter unless you have a food allergy. But that is with good cause because they are very tasty just the way they make it. I chose the lamb and it was absolutely delightful!

Do you come in a large group because this is the place you come to share food especially the charcuterie, you get to choose whatever you want on it and it is a sure crowd pleaser.

Drinks are spot on! And the wine list is extensive!"}
{"text":"Best place ever. The food is so good and well prepared. I recommend the spinach tortellini di ricotta, it is quite scrumptious. Lots of hot waiters. 10/10 would recommend this amazing place."}
{"text":"Good choice for groups, they are able to serve you quickly and efficiently. Ambiance is very dark and loud for dinner, food was all around good and enjoyed by the group. It's pretty packed, so I would suggest making reservations.

The truffle pasta was good, they don't skimp on the truffle!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent.....service has attitude.

We ventured down a few weeks ago and thought we'd pop in as it's been a while.
I love the building it's in and love the feeling of the restaurant....it has an old classic charm to it.
Anyways, I've never been disappointed in a meal, although it can be a tad on the higher price scale for similar food elsewhere.
When the server brought bread to the table, she just brought some olive oil. One of our dining companions asked for Balsamic Vinegar, the response from the waitress was \"no\". He then asked for butter...the answer again was \"no\". No discussion, nothing...just a no.
When we ordered our meals, my niece ordered a linguini dish but asked if instead of the linguini could she get either spaghetti or angel hair pasta instead. Waitress response was \"No, there are no substitutions\". My niece said \"oh, the pasta I wanted is used in another dish and if you have to cook the pasta anyways, can't you just give me the one I want rather than linguini?\" Answer back....\"No\" 
For the rest of the evening the waitress avoided us, not noticing when we needed drink refills, etc. Had I not been with relatives I would have copped major attitude back at her and called the manager over.
Strictly due to either their strict rules or this persons poor customer service skills, we will not be rushing back here."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday evening with reservations. This place is always busy! I always order their seafood linguini and arugula salad, the best!! Highly recommend this place if you're craving for pasta, price is decent and good service!"}
{"text":"Terroni is a bit of a dream come true at the end of a long day. As soon as the huge glass doors open, you can let the Italian haze wash away your stresses. And if that doesn't work, try the Negroni - a citrusy, guaranteed second wind.

Don't be fooled into expecting a completely relaxing night though, just about every other young professional will be here doing the same thing. Prepare to jockey for drink orders at the bar while you wait for your table to come up (no reservations). Our party of three was given a 30 minute wait that quickly turned into 50 - a flub excusable only because we ended up in a big, private booth rather than sitting on top of our neighbours like everyone else. Again, the $9 Prosecco by the glass didn't hurt either.

As for the food, I've never experienced a caprese salad quite like this one. It sounds simple but the buffalo mozzarella is beyond compare. I was also really impressed with their butternut squash stuffed ravioli in a gorgonzola cream sauce. It's a favourite dish of mine that usually has me keeling over with The Fulls minutes later, but this one was lighter than most and had a much better balance of the strong flavours.

Definitely worth the long wait...well, this time at least."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience at Terroni! We arrived at the restaurant at 7pm on a Tuesday and were able to be seated right away, but the restaurant did quickly fill up after that. If you plan on eating later, a reservation might be necessary! 

The restaurant is really big has a great atmosphere. I think it is in an old bank or something like that- it is super cool nonetheless! 

We ordered the traditional Bolognese and the Santo Stefano pizza and split them, they were both so delicious. The Bolognese had just the right amount of sauce and was full of great flavours. The Santo Stefano pizza was just the same - packed full of flavour and great ingredients. The prosciutto onto of the pizza was delicious and was just the right amount of salty. The arugula on the pizza was also a nice touch. The pizzas do not come pre-cut so just be aware of that. 

Our server was nice and helped with recommending dishes for us.

Overall, we had a great experience at Terroni and will definitely be going back the next time visitors are in town!"}
{"text":"Terroni is my favourite pizza place of all time! I have tried many places that tried to claim the title of Best Pizza in TO, and in my book, NO ONE can beat Terroni's pizza. My favourite: the Pizza Cosí (tomato, porcini mushrooms, mozzarella, fontina and prosciutto di parma)! to die for! Just thinking about it now makes me hungry. The pizza is fresh, tasty and big. I can only finish the 3/4 of it and I am always happy to grab the rest for a later snack or next day lunch. Amazing pizza, lovely staff and great vibe. If you have room for a dessert after, try their Tiramisu. Absolutely divine!"}
{"text":"Ravioli stuffed with duck confit is good!
Atmosphere and service was good on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"My colleague and I ate here during a business trip to Toronto and had an excellent meal. I had the duck and butternut squash ravioli, which I highly recommend. The building is an old courthouse, so make sure to check out the lower level where they converted jail cells into wine cellars. Very cool."}
{"text":"I made the trek into downtown Toronto from work to meet with 7 friends at Terroni for dinner. It was my first visit there but a few in my group have been there a few times. Our hosts reserved a table in advance so we were promptly seated once the party arrived.

After settling down and catching up on news, we placed our orders. Half the group ordered full plate sized pizzas - Marinara, Capricciosa, Polentona were among the varieties - most had to go for take away at the end given the generous amount. I had a spinach pasta with lamb ragu. It was excellent and very flavorful. 

The general atmosphere was casual. I would say the noise volume was moderate given we had a separate room. The experience at Terroni on Adelaide was great and I would visit again in the future."}
{"text":"I thought this was an ok spot.  Initially agreed to check Terroni out since my cousin is such a fan and I also missed a Terroni dinner in LA.  

Food: I only tried the Salmon pizza.  The pizza was kind of dry with stale salmon pieces.  I enjoyed it more after pouring in chilli oil and olive oil.

Environment: Great for a girl's night or date spot. Ranges from semi-casual to formal.

Staff: Very friendly by the bar."}
{"text":"I don't like the food or atmosphere here.  Between the ridiculous rules for what dishes they let you put parmesan cheese on to the  cold reception staff - I really don't get a good viper. Besides this the food is mediocre at best. My pizza was bland.  Really not very good. The bolognese seemed ok, very meaty.  But on the whole not a good place.  Go to Grazie at yonge and eglington,  always a good meal there, way better in every respect and they do what customer wants."}
{"text":"Solid spot for Italian. It's not overly fancy by any means and mostly serves up mainstream Italian dishes, but they are well executed. I found the pizza to be delicious, probably the highlight of my meal. I also tried some pasta, and while it was simplistic, it was done quite well, just a touch on the blander side however. Atmosphere is excellent; it's a rather neat venue (especially if you can get a seat on the third floor on the balcony). Terrific option for a night out or a date that doesn't call for something overly spendy or extravagant. Service was pleasant although it seemed to be flustered at some points.

The only thing I didn't care for was the dessert I had. It was a nutella ball, and although it was good (when isn't nutella good?), was basically just a fried ball of dough with nutella inside."}
{"text":"It's fine but they're snobs. Libretto is better for pizza and for when you want to be treated like a human."}
{"text":"I went to enjoy a nice night out for  dinner and drinks . I was quite disappointed with  as I assumed the food would be great. Ordered a tortellini  dish stuffed with cheese and spinach . I felt as though the dish lacked flavour. It also was a ridiculously small portion size . I counted five tortellini on my plate . Sorry but this place is over rated ! You would be better off staying home !"}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely. Food was terrific (especially the lemon ricotta dessert), as was the service. Truly a pleasure and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Amazing place for dinner out with friends and could be a cute date night too. I was impressed from the appetizer all the way to flourless chocolate cake for dessert. I will definitely be returning for more! Our server Jenna was fantastic with her food, wine, and tea recommendations too!"}
{"text":"Picked this spot for a quick work meeting and was really impressed. Got the salad and the grilled calamari to share, and then seafood pasta with mussels, clams and shrimp for the main. The bread and olive oil as starters were yummy!! The food was authentic and delish. Done really well but portions were a bit small. The pasta also only included 1 piece of shrimp!!! Like com'on!! Also, not a great choice as it got busy and loud real quick, but we totally enjoyed the food! Price wise it was average - we paid around $80 for 2 (with wine) and parking on street is easy to find. Service was stellar and the food came out real quick, which I LOVE! Definitely worth going to for an Italian night!"}
{"text":"The food at Terroni is amazing, which you can clearly tell from how packed the place is every night. From their fresh pastas to traditional pizzas and incredible charcuterie I've never eaten something here I disliked. In fact, on a recent trip to italy, I found myself not blown away by the \"real\" food across the pond because I could get the same quality at Terroni back home without the crippling Euro exchange rate.

That being said, they lose 2 stars for service being a complete gong-show. I get it, they're busy, crazy even, but almost everytime I'm there issues arise. And by issues I don't mean things that can't be helped like food wait times. I mean more like missing cutlery that you have to ask 3 or 4 times to have delivered, bringing apps and mains out at weird times so people in my party are all at different stages in their meals, clearing plates too soon so the slow eaters at the table feel like awkward jerks, serving the tables around ours while we wait 45 for the bill we asked for more than once until we finally have to get up and ask the hostess to check us out. At least it's never dull.

The staff is always very nice and has a sweet disposition but it seems like management really should get it together. Unfortunately however, when that's the broken link in the chain it rarely is repaired."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant for the atmosphere but have my hesitations when it comes to the menu. This is definitely the place to be on a Friday or Saturday night as the only reservation we could get was for 9pm. Upon arrival I was saddened to hear that they only offer minimal gluten free pasta options (no gluten free pizza) and that you can't customize existing dishes. Because of this I ended up getting the calamari appetizer which was actually very good! The calamari was melt in your mouth and there were two large pieces for approx. $20 (good value). I'll likely return but would like to see more gluten free items on their menu."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The food was ok nothing great but the staff is outrageously obnoxious and rude! 
Firstly it was our graduation party so we were in a group of 15. One of our freinds as a surprise got a cake for us and we din't know they dont allow outside cakes as they have their own bakery. Anyway so the hostess mentions to us that each slice will be charged 10 dollars so for 15 people to cut the 20 dollar cake we will be charge 150 dollars!
We asked to speak to the manager to make an exception for us but the manager Ralph (or something like that) was super rude and he even called our attitude NON CANADIAN!!! 
The food was mediocre and I am really dissapointed with all the good reviews this place received. 
I am sure the other branches are good but please stay away from this one if you dont want to be insulted!"}
{"text":"Not bad but I've definitely had better. Service could have been quicker, took a while to get drinks. Server wasn't the friendliest and always seemed to be looking around to see what was next instead of focusing on what was at hand"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and am definitely coming back! 

Dare I say this, but I actually am not a huge fan of pizza. Something about the cheese and dough just makes me feel like it's unnecessary calories entering my body. The fou meu pizza we got here has changed my mind. The dough tasted fresh, the fried eggplant (yes eggplant on my pizza) was surprisingly delicious along with the sausage was a perfect balance of crisp and flavour. I also loved how thin the tough was. You don't feel extremely bloated after eating a few slices. 

We also got the truffle pasta which was also very good, but in my opinion, not aaaasss good as the pizza. The pasta was the perfect amount of chewiness. I find that most Italian places have their pasta a little too al dante for my liking. But the texture of this pasta was exactly what I wanted. Beware though, despite its small serving size appearance, the dish is quite heavy. I love truffle so can never go wrong with that! 

Okay food aside, now the venue: absolutely LOVE. I was placed on the fourth floor (was surprised how big this place was) and I loved the ambiance. It wasn't too loud and the tables were spread apart enough so that you felt like you had your own little private dining experience almost. I loved the leather couches and the round desks - a perfect date place (except mine was just a friendly catch up session but still amazing for that as well). 

The only small hiccup that ruined my experience would probably be the waiter. He wasn't the friendliest and I often felt quite rushed but maybe he was just having a rough day."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Tried the Funghi Assoluti, which is baked mushrooms with balsamic and arugula, the deep fried calamari, and tortelloni with ricotta and spinach. Everything was super tasty. Menu is on the pricier side but definitely worth it. The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous as well!"}
{"text":"Terroni is high up there in one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to. Just fantastic, from start to finish. 

Drink menu is curated with a lot of Italian classics, some neat gin and tonic options, and some originals. I had a beer I forget the name of and my girlfriend got a pricier cocktail with Italian lemon soda. Great stuff, but pricey. 

Menu is divided into appetizers, pastas, pizza and paninis. We were a party of four that all started off wanting pasta, until three of us looked at the pizzas and decided to switch. I ended up getting a marguerita pizza as an appetizer, and the zucchini flower pizza from the season specials (because carbs). My girlfriend went with the agnolotti stuffed with spinach and ricotta with a butter sage sauce. 

The marguerita was one of the best I've had. Beautiful sauce, generous cheese, and a fantastic thin crust that had substance and didn't feel like a cracker. Great start.

My girlfriends agnolotti were drenched in that beautiful, velvety, butter sage sauce, and she was able to take her pizza crusts to dip into with. Pasta was perfection. 

My pizza had zucchini flowers, ricotta, buffalo mozzarella, some cherry tomatoes, and generous strips of anchovies. The bomb. Absolutely the bomb. My only criticism is to be more generous with the zucchini flowers - I got such a paltry amount of the least expensive ingredient on the pizza. Still, it didn't really warrant anything less than 5 stars because the pizza was still the bomb. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Terroni is located on Adelaide, it is the next door neighbour to the Courthouse club; so it is ideally situated if you want to eat and party the night away. 

Came here after a day of city hopping with the boyfriend, (Doors Open 2011), we were served promptly, and quicker than the wait time the hostess quoted us, which was great. 

The set-up of the Adelaide location is divided in to a bar in the front portion, with a main dining room just beyond the hostess station
We were seated in the main dining room, with the atrium off to the one side of us, and the kitchen on the other.

Maybe, it is because I've had a lot of good Italian food lately, but I thought Terroni was a bit lacking.. in that little something that made it extra memorable. It does bother me that I can't quite put my finger on what I didn't like about it. 

I should mention that it is my second visit to this local chain (since they do have several locations dotted throughout the city, the other is located in the Queen West area). 

The atmosphere is a study in contrast between the two locations that I have visited. One is a bustling family restaurant, the other... a bustling supper club, complete with DJ. 

We ordered their mushroom salad (Funghi Assoluti) to start, which was great... but I thought there was a tad too much parmigiano and there were plenty of mushrooms, and the balsamic balanced nicely, but it was missing that extra-crispy crunch, that i expected from a salad. (either that or I've been spoiled by Pizza Liberetto and Vinsanto)

The boyfriend ordered the Wild Boar Pappardelle (Pappardelle al Sugo di Cinghiale) and I ordered the Gnocchi special, which was butternut squash gnocchi with parmigiano, sage(basil?) and finished with butter. 

The pappardelle was better, but I couldn't get over the fact that it kinda tasted like... Chinese-style 5-spice stewed beef, it was quite enjoyable. I just kept flashing back to the huang siew beef noodle soup that you can get for cheaper up in Markham. It might be because they use Star-anise in it. 

The Gnocchi was butternut squash, other than that there isn't that much to say about it beyond that.. It had the color of butternut squash, and it tasted like butternut squash, I smell my dish when it came out... and it smelled like melted butter, which was interesting; but like i said before there wasn't much else to comment on. It's good in a way that it was done so simply, but I kinda was left searching for the wow factor. 

We split a flourless chocolate cake for dessert, which was good. I can't tell you if it was fab, as I told the boyfriend to eat the rest; as I am no chocoholic cake fan, I thought the white chocolate sauce was fine, and strawberry that they serve it with was great.  He loved the cake, and thought I was crazy, not to eat another bite, but there you are. 

The service was great, considering how busy it was. The waiter came and checked on us a few times, and when I mentioned chocolate wasn't my thing, he did offer to get me a scoop of gelato, instead, which was a nice gesture. 

The only worry is that the tables of two are kinda close to each other, that when either party sitting next to us, got up or the waiter came between our tables, either our cups or bread basket would shift... so enough elbow room if you're just sitting, anything... keep an eye on your cups or basket or plates as they might shift because you're a mite too closely packed in. 

The decor is interesting, considering the building looks heritage on the outside and very modern art-gallery on the inside. It was kinda weird in the atrium they have some hanged dummies (artwork?) on the wall, which is kinda off-putting(but would make a great conversation piece), but since I had my back to it, I didn't really care.

But overall, good, pleasant experience, but not particularly memorable."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Fantastic food.  Excellent service.  Warm fun dining environment for lunch or dinner.  Been a bunch of times since it's close to my house and it's so reliable I know what I'm getting every time.  The downside is they don't allow substitutions or take custom orders BUT the staff will help any way they can.  Also they have a vegan menu which is so amazing."}
{"text":"I recommend reservations. Even on a Wed night, the wait was 45 minutes.
Overall the location is ideal, the food is good. 
The attitude of the waiter/waitress' is off the chart. 
Two examples; the bar area has table toppers set for two. There were three of us. The barmaid would not allow two of us to sit and one to stand, nor do they permit three stools at the table. 
The alternative was to wait outdoors or loaf in the lobby (very small, lots of traffic).
Asking for the gnocci, the waiter was asked to please put the tomato sauce on the side. He refused the request, explaining that the chef is professional, educated, and makes his food the way he feels it should be served, and it offends him when there are special requests. 
With the request modified to \"please put on light sauce\" instead, the request was again refused. The chef makes it the way he wants it eaten.
The same was said about salad. They would not deliver salad that wasn't dressed. Either eat salad with their dressing or don't have one.

Food was delivered fast, hot, and tasty. Not stellar, but above what gnocci is in many chain restaurants. The lasagna was fabulous."}
{"text":"Outstanding server. Above average but not amazing food,  horrible nasty bit** of a hostess.

Decent and slightly overpriced Italian food, with a very nice selection of wines."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Organized a work social here, staff were very hospitable! Great apps, the charcuterie board was plentiful. Ordered the sea bass (full fish served whole, head and everything) and it was delicious!! The chocolate cake for dessert was also amazing! Great food!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday with my wife and 2 small children. The staff were great, our server was extremely knowledgeable, he paired the perfect wine with our meal. This is a must for people with children. Also the food was very good. One of the best experiences I had at this price point."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get Italian! They have an amazing menu! I always usually will get this cured meat and olive plate as an appetizer. I would highly recommend that. The chillis are also amazing! We always get request from our 905 friends to get some for them since we live close by. The last time we were there we also sat next to Italian Oscar winner Roberto Bennini from the movie Life is Beautiful. I only give them 4/5 stars cuz every time I go we always end up having to eat at the bar... Which is always uncomfortable an annoying."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why I haven't review this place before, since I've been there a couple of times on previous Toronto visits.  So, no time like the present!

We split a salad and pizza and both were as good as always.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  It's definitely pricey for what you get, so be prepared.  If you're looking for just a regular pizza joint, this isn't it."}
{"text":"I still prefer the Queen street Terroni due to the back patio but for a winter location this one is perfect. The main room is gorgeous. The staff was very good.. We had the funghi assoluti as a app. It was amazing. The reduction was done perfectly. The parpadelle was pretty too.
Service was very good especially given the size of our party and how busy it was.
Easily 3.5+ resto and a great place to kick off a night downtown. I'm rounding up to 4 due to the great service."}
{"text":"Incredible ambiance that was a combination of old-world and chic... The food was phenomenal, with service the rivaled such. A colleague and I ordered the calamari fritti (wow!) and split two pizzas (a white with rapini and spicy sausage, as well as a tomato with prosciutto and arugula).

A great selection of wine and an overwhelming complement of scents from their homemade goods left me regretting I had no room to stay any longer. Will absolutely return again."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh ingredients here.

Atmosphere is trendy and lively.

Had the caprese salad with the mozza cheese.  Simple and tastes great.

Pizza was authentic thin crust with fresh proscuito ham and pine nuts.

Apparently there is a good patio but we sat at the very front near the door since it was so busy and didn't have the patience to wait.

Waiter was all business and that's fine with me."}
{"text":"Ordered the Rigatoni Arcobaleno - mozzarella di bufala, zucchini, light cherry tomato sauce and basil. Cleaned my plate within minutes (a rare occurrence). Highly recommend going with friends, not the best date spot. Far too noisy to get to know someone in there. But the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Hmmm...I've been twice and I not overly impressed. I just feel the food could be...better. 
Staff is super friendly but don't go to any of the Terroni's if you want a quiet meal. 
1st time: Tasty Lambrusco to drink, calamari(just ok), lemony pasta that was good but just ok.
2nd time(another location): Hot as Hades. My husband and daughter were sweating profusely. Best salad had some unnecessary tasteless chickpea pancake and was decent but meh.
Salmon was on slightly over cooked and over salted. 
So what I'm saying is...so many amazing restaurants in Toronto, so little time. This one wasn't a stand out:("}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

The service here is excellent and quite consistent. The restaurant gets very busy on weekends, so it's important to put your name down early and take a walk around the neighbourhood before your name is called. The atmosphere is unique and kind of rustic. It's a very big restaurant with multiple floors, and it has a large rooftop patio where they cook outdoors on their BBQ grill.

I really enjoy their fresh pasta and their pizzas. In my opinion, this place is probably better than most other typical Italian bistros in the area, particularly because of the service and food quality. I've been here with my partner and also with a large group for my birthday last year and it went very smoothly. The price is comparable to any Italian bistro/restaurant in the city.

The chili oil is also delicious and I told myself that the next time I go there, I would buy a jar for myself (they sell some of their products by the entrance). The chili oil is good on anything, including pastas and pizzas!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with quality service. Gnocchi is so delicious here. Good for lunch or dinner. Lots of variety on the menu to choose from. From pasta to pizza to salad and appetizers."}
{"text":"Only okay for me. Came here after drinks on a Thursday night. The restaurant was very busy so you should probably make reservations. 

The restaurant itself is very nice and spacious. We sat upstairs.

Service was average, with nothing outstanding.

I ordered the Italian sausage and black truffle shaving pasta. It was tasty but amazing and didn't justify the price of $25 for me. 

Overall, it's worth a try for Italian but I don't think I'll be dying to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went there for my friends birthday party. This place seems popular and already packed at 6pm. Food is decent but definitely at $$ mark. Highly recommend there mushroom salad and tiramisu dessert!"}
{"text":"Terrible service from Terroni - Price St this evening- do not go here if you have a young baby, or at all actually. Highly inconsiderate and unprofessional staff. Short story - despite arriving early and the patio being seated on a first come first serve basis, they would not let 2 adults and a baby in a high chair sit at a table for 4, only a table for 2 in direct sunlight. 3 adults however promptly sat at the table for 4 in the shade. We left."}
{"text":"I've grown to be a fan of Italian cusine over the years and began to appreciate the carby goodness that makes up most Italian dishes.  Terroni has been on my list of to-go's for a while, and I was definitely not disappointed.

To start, we ordered the fried calamari.  Served in a simple paper cone, the calamari sat under a soft coat of light dough which made me forget I was eating something that was not nice to one's cholesterol.  

In deciding the main; I like my pasta thicker and chewy, which made the pappardelle alla iosa an ideal choice.  The homemade spicy sausage was low on the spice but made a fusion of flavour.  The balance of EVOO and oyster mushrooms complimented the sausage well, and paired with the chewy pasta I would say this is one of the best pappardelle dishes I've had

For dessert, we shared a sponge cake that was made with lemon and mascarpone.  First bite, underwhelming.  But as we continued to nibble on the light dessert to finish, the soft lemon tangyness coupled with the light cream made this cake a delightful end to our meal.  The ambiance is quite nice for a casual night out, I would definitely come back again to try more dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"So overrated. First the restaurant does not accommodate for substitutions. Most of the pizzas included prosciutto and waiter refused to remove it. Secondly, we asked for balsamic vinegar to mix with the olive oil served with bread. They claimed they didn't have any (what Italian restaurant doesn't use balsamic vinegar?). Same claim for
oregano. Lastly, the pizza came in one piece and we had to slice it ourselves. Never coming back, so many better Italian places in town with better service."}
{"text":"I recently dined here for a birthday dinner with a few other individuals. It had been quite some time since I had visited this particular location and overall not much had changed in terms of the ambiance, the service or even the menu.

For a Monday night, it was surprisingly busy; however, not busy enough to justify the inattentive service. We had multiple servers and when we would attempt to ask one to come to the table for service, we were told that another server would come around. Furthermore, the tables are so close together it feels like you're invading your neighbours' party!

Our meals consisted of: The Verde salad which was overdressed and a tad soggy, the Margherita pizza (which we asked to be sliced for the birthday girl, but apparently slicing it ruins the authenticity), the Salmon which was actually quite a good portion with a salad on the side, and the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese which was thoroughly enjoyed! We were not offered any daily food or drink specials. There were a few dietary concerns from guests and when the server was asked to clarify whether these would be a part of the meal, she did not return. In fact, the meal was presented to the guest before even making us aware of if the ingredient of concern would be included.

Additionally, there were significant delays after we were finished with dinner and asked for the dessert menu; and when she finally arrived to take our order, we had been waiting for an additional 30 mins after completing the meal. Furthermore, when the dessert finally arrived for our birthday girl with a lit candle, it wasn't the dessert she ordered!

Overall, the experience was 'pleasant' and our birthday girl enjoyed her night, which was the most important thing! I wish that I could say that my dining experiences at the other locations have been better, but the issues of inattentive service, little changes in the menu or consideration of dietary concerns has been consistent.

I can't say that I would be eager to return."}
{"text":"Very nice space, especially the patio! The funghi is the best thing on the menu in my opinion, but the food is quite pricey in overall"}
{"text":"Loved the food, it was busy so the service was a little slow but not terrible. Great atmosphere to catch up with friends and just chat. 3 stars because it didn't stand out."}
{"text":"Went with the boy for my birthday dinner, and we both liked it. The appetizer of grilled octopus was not chewy, but at the same time steak like in texture. Nice big piece for two.
Our mains were good too. I got the pasta with wild crumbled sausage with dandelion greens.
Dessert was really good, a butterscotch pudding with caramel and rosemary salt beads."}
{"text":"Really good meal.  Buffalo short ribs were great as well as the cured meats and cheeses.   Wine selection is very good.  The ambiance is young, cool, and hip.  Only complaint is that the pizzas can be hard to eat as they weren't sliced.  Made a business meal awkward."}
{"text":"Myself and a party of 6 had a fabulous experience at Terroni on Saturday night!! Our server Brook deserves to be recognized, her vibrant personality and great recommendations added to the overall experience. The food was delicious and even in a city like Toronto with endless restaurants to consider, I can't wait to go back there! I don't have a single complaint- exceptional!"}
{"text":"Simply love everything Terroni. Been here several times, and the last one was for a friends gathering. Of course had to call in advance, and because it was for more than 10 people, the manager had to approve it, and they had to call me back. The day came and it happened to be a snow day, still, Terroni was plenty busy. The service was pretty slow, but still friendly and the food arrived promptly. We ordered a Tagliere del Salumiere (charcuterie board), Pizza Margherita, Burrata, Pappardelle alla Iosa (pasta with spicy sausage). Needless to say, as usual, everything was excellent.

Tip: For those of you that are coming for the first time to a Terroni restaurant, be warned that they do not accommodate any substitutions. It's written on their menu and they stick to it. They do not compromise the integrity of their dishes, and they shouldn't have to; there are plenty of restaurants in the city that will accept your requests. This may not be the place for you. So if you are reading this, don't complain later.

\"So out of respect for Italian gastronomy--and our grandparents--we maintain a no modifications, no substitutions policy.\""}
{"text":"Delicious food. We always get the Cana ala Mare pasta. It's the seafood pasta that contains clams, mussels, shrimp, scallop and squid. It's so delicious. My husband was never a big seafood fan and I actually think this pasta made him a true seafood lover. The only thing is this place will not accept any alterations to any food menu items. This place is a bit of a food nazi in that way. But their food will not disappoint. We also get the calamari to start, fried that is, but they do offer it grilled. I would definitely recommend this place for some good Italian eats!"}
{"text":"Good food but avoid on Friday and Saturday nights if you're looking for decent service.

Waiter went missing for 20 minutes at a time, plates took forever to clear (finally ended up putting them on another table), drinks were empty for half the meal. 

Disappointed!"}
{"text":"(If it was possible, this review would be 3.5 stars)
Terroni is comfort food for me. It remains so, and I'll keep going back because of it. But a few things irked me on my most recent visit...

First, the Good:
The food is still so very yummy. A reasonable take on traditional, Italian fare~ Simple, and fresh. The pizza was great. The Olive oil was delicious. I could subsist solely on their hot peppers in oil. 
Their Tiramisu was to die for~ No joke. While it was a far cry from authentic, I'm sure they used an entire tub of mascarpone in that single serving. We devoured that generous portion in a minute, flat. I would *bathe* in that dessert, if I could.

The decor & ambiance is still great. The demographic...well, it was...ours. Young professionals, mostly. Since Terroni isn't the newest & latest, it was void of the trend-following crowd. 

The Weird & the Niggly:
The prices for Pizza & Mains are incredibly reasonable; however, the appetizers & salads, desserts & wines by the glass, are *outrageously* expensive! It's so strange~ everything on their menu seems to be around the same price...

The wines that we had, were mediocre, at best. At $14.00 a glass, the sparkling wine I ordered should've been exceptional. It was merely, good.

I remember the good-old-days of Terroni... When they left a grater of fresh parmesan at your table for you to use as you pleased. I imagine this got very expensive. (I *might* admit to abusing the privilege, if you back me into a corner...)
Many years ago, they switched to the common server-proffered topping.

We were told the other night, the chefs no longer allow Parmesan added to the pizza (nor the seafood pastas) as they say it messes with the 'carefully selected cheese blends and delicate flavour' and 'italian chefs are so picky when it comes to their cheeses'... I'm paraphrasing, but that was the gist. 
My man, never one to hold back, (discreetly, after the server departed, of course) stated that it was 'bull',  as any restaurant in Italy will smother as much cheese as possible on your dish. 
Nevertheless, the smoked cheese on the pizza *was* a delight,  and more than compensated for my disappointment...

The service was passable. Nothing lacking, but nothing to write home about.

I love Terroni. I do. And I don't really like to be negative, ever. But I was a teensy-bit disappointed with our visit. But I'll be back, if only to meet my quota on those hot peppers..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both for company dinners when the CEOs come in from out of town. 

Service: I haven't had a problem with the service either time. The staff are tidy, cheerful, and professional. They're very helpful in recommending wines and translating a couple of menu items that we couldn't figure out. My boss loved the big green olives and asked the server what kind of olives they were, and she wasn't sure and asked someone else who didn't know either, and finally came back with a jar from the kitchen marked 'green olives'. See? Helpful. :)

Ambience: casual, fun, and loud. When you come in through the front doors you're in the little enoteca area, which has a sandwich counter and little tables. It feels like a nightclub out there, with lots of pretty people standing around sipping drinks before they go in for dinner. The old courthouse building is beautiful and has high ceilings, but all the plaster and brick make the acoustics lousy if you want to hear what people at your table are saying.

Food: I haven't been disappointed. Even a plain grilled veggie appetizer plate is absolutely perfect. Perfect oyster mushrooms, perfect asparagus, perfect endive. The meat-eaters in our group shared a board of Italian cured meats, which included spicy in-house sausage, strips of translucent prosciutto, and others. If you're not into big appetizers, get the olive-and-bread plate. It sounds plain, but again, everything on the plate is just perfect.

The pasta is all made in-house as well. Toppings to be found on pasta and pizza include sausages and ham and duck, unusual smelly cheeses, and vegetable oddities like dandelion greens. I had a divine white pizza with black truffles, porcini mushrooms, and burrata. If you want something less adventurous you can get a pie with more standard pizzeria toppings. The crusts are the wide, flat, and crisp-edged Neapolitan type. I was hard-pressed to finish one.

The wine list is extensive and the desserts are excellent. I've had the immense creamy brandy-spiked tiramisu, and the delicately-flavoured lemon cake called 'torta di Nonna' (Grandma's cake). 

The lack of wheelchair-accessibility and the absurd acoustics make me take off a full star. Everything else makes this the best restaurant I've eaten in for the price point.

(One more hint: they take reservations only before 6:30 pm. I'm not sure if that depends on the day of the week. If you go for dinner after 6:30, be there early or prepare to stand in line.)"}
{"text":"I've been to the Terroni location by Trinity Bellwoods two other times but this was my first time trying this location. I booked a reservation here out of convenience since it was walkable to the ACC for a concert.

If you're looking for a romantic night out, this isn't the place to go since it's louder than most restaurants (if you're on the ground floor) because of the high ceilings. Also, the tables are very close together which makes it uncomfortable to squeeze by the neighbouring table when you have to get in and out of your seat if you're the one sitting against the wall.

There isn't a shortage of food and drink options here but their food was just okay for me this time. I ordered a lamb pasta with dandelions in a tomato based sauce, while my husband ordered the ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig and butternut squash in a cream sauce. Both sounded really unique and we hadn't tried either dishes before here. It was a surprise when the dishes came out in 10 minutes. It turned out to be a bit disappointing because I remember the pasta tasting really good at the other Terroni location and it was just average here...something was off about the flavours, though my husband's order tasted a bit better than mine. The portion size was good though and the dishes were filling. The tastiness of the tiramisu for dessert made up for the averageness of our entrees. 

Service was okay. Our server was nice enough but I guess since the place was busy, she wasn't as attentive as we barely saw her in our area. We also felt a bit rushed even though we had only been there for just over an hour - it's like they wanted to keep clearing out tables as quick as possible.

All in all, not a terrible restaurant to go to for Italian food but not the most memorable either."}
{"text":"This place is very beautiful and one of my friends favourite places.  The patio which was on the Roof was amazing!

We ordered drinks which had Aperol and Procesco, white wine, a salad and grilled calamari.  we topped it off with a ice cream stuffed coissant with Nutella.  All great tasting, simple food.

One of my favourite things is that they do not allow substitutions/changes unless you are severely allergic.  

The price for our meal was a little pricey since they weren't entree items but the taste taste and atmosphere was amazing. 

I'd come back again as I've yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a really cool Young street Italian Restaurant. Has a Fantastic rooftop dining area that look out over north Toronto...amazing view. 

Had the Ricchia Salad as an Appie. It was good but very little flavour except what came from the cheese itself. The dressing was an olive oil but I would have preferred a balsamic dressing. 

My main was the Smendozzatq Pizza. Wood-Oven baked very tasty. All these type of Wood-Oven Pizza seem to run into the same issue...crust is cooked but the centre of the pie is soggy. This one had the same issue. Vert tasty but soggy. 

We had a delightful server named Shelly who was polite, patient & delivered great service, what more can you ask for? 

All in all...a do-over to be sure!!"}
{"text":"This was a non-busy Monday nite. 

The calamari was fried & done to perfection. The sausage & blue cheese pizza was delicious & baked to perfection. House made warm mushroom salad was outta this world! And the desserts well...let me tell you! It was so delicious it was out of this world! The only Dow. Side...snotty waiter."}
{"text":"Hilarious! Wife orders a salad, with the prosciutto on the side, since she doesn't eat meat, but son does. Sorry, they don't do that. Well, where in the salad is the prosciutto placed? It's piled on top. Well, can't you just pile it on a separate plate instead? Nope. Ok, she orders a less expensive salad instead.

Son and daughter order pasta mains. He gets the Bolognese, she takes the seafood. She'd like some parmesan on hers. Nope. They don't put it on the seafood pasta. My son asks if they will put it on his. Absolutely! (I mean, obviously!) Will they grate it on to a separate plate, so he can distribute it on to his plate himself? Waiter refuses. He suspects (correctly) that daughter may try to put it on her seafood pasta. After checking with his manager, manager, in a show of tremendous reluctance, grates it on to a clean plate.

Still not sure if we were being filmed for \"Candid Camera\".

Food was fine. So what? This is the City of Toronto! There are, like, 30000 Italian restaurants with good food. Why bother with these guys, who know better than you which ingredient complements which, and which would be an unforgivable affront to the dead seafood?"}
{"text":"For a safe, good and unpretentious experience, Terroni will deliver. 

Just been there 2 days ago with my partner and we had a good time. 

We were seated promptly at the back patio. That patio is very nice and cozy. The tables are not crammed together, there's nice little lights everywhere and high walls to keep the wind away. 

As for service, our waitress was very polite, knew her menu well and was always there on time. Some other staff members came to deliver the dishes and they were as pleasant to interact with. 

We shared the Carpaccio di Polpo (5/5) and oh my, was it good. Tasted fresh, a little bit zesty and there was enough for the both of us. It also came with greens and pan fried potatoes, black pepper, capers and oil. Great mix altogether. 

Before the main, we were served homemade bread served with olive oil and peppers (5/5). That peppers tapenade was so good we asked for a second serving. 

For mains, we both when for the Pappardelle alla Iosa (4/5). Spicy sausage, mushrooms, peas, parmigiano and olive oil. Simple yet good and filling dish. It could have been slightly spicier BUT, we used the peppers tapenade from the bread, we mixed some of it and it had a great kick ;) 

As for pricing, it's reasonable for the quality / quantity you are to expect. 

We were delighted to see a wall of products on the way out, including the peppers tapenade. For $11 tax in. you get a fairly big jar to bring home. They also sell pastas, sauces and the like."}
{"text":"I've been to this Terroni's location a number of times in the past 2 years and my personal experience is that this place has delicious Italian food and has consistent service.  Although I've seen their huge pizza dishes, they look too large for me, but I absolutely love their fresh pasta dish.  Al dente, every single time.  I've also tried their summer special lobster gnocchi, and their starters.  There isn't anything that doesn't please.  

The reason for 5 stars is the cute little patio in the back that faces right into the little park and churches on the lower part of Church street.  Considering that this is downtown Toronto, this cute little view is amazing and rare.  I can't think of any other downtown Toronto patios that could give a comparable view.  I've recommended Terroni's for a work dinner event before, and luckily we were able to get the patio seats and I have to admit that all of the out-of-towners were very impressed with the view, the service, the food and the drinks.  And I felt like the Torontonian who was \"in-the-know\" of all the cool places to dine in Toronto.  Winner!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY recommend the adorable patio for a romantic date night. Food was amazing, wine was terrific, atmosphere was the best. 

I have yet to find a patio that has a similar atmosphere to Terroni's on Queen West..."}
{"text":"I had an outing with a special someone who's a somewhat picky eater. I made sure I picked a restaurant with a long list of pizza choices to choose from and decided Terroni was the perfect restaurant.

This is my third time here and they didn't disappoint! The picky eater of course got the plainest pizza there was - Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, basil). I as usual looked for the most interesting thing on the menu -  Ravioli di Zio Paperone  (homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig). I was really interested in the duck confit and fig combination because I've never had fig in my pasta before.

My friend liked the pizza because it's not too oily. I liked my ravioli but didn't love it. I thought it was a tad bit salty and I wanted more fig! I still enjoyed my meal though! (I may be a bit bias because the person I was with made the meal enjoyable!)

All in all this is a solid restaurant and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is certainly overrated. I went for my birthday and the quality of food was very poor, the pastas tasted dry and stale. You can tell it wasn't fresh. The server seemed like she hated her job, she was rude and kept trying to rush us. Terroni isn't anything special, there are many better Italian restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that their Buffalo mozzarella salad (one of the best in the city) has drastically decreased in size, I still think Terroni is good for what it is - a pizza/pasta place.

Lord knows why this place is so popular...I mean they do have a great thin crust pizza -- but who can screw that up and what Italian restaurant since 1992 hasn't offered that?  Nevertheless, popping up all over the city, this place has definitely tricked its customers into believing its the best.  Perhaps their no substitutions policy has convinced its patrons that its mystical combinations can't be topped.  If you ask me, I like to choose my toppings..but then again, what do I know?"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to review for awhile. This place is super solid!! Look no further for consistent and fresh Italian experience, and I should mention authentic too. I was just in Italy and this place strongly compares to some of the pizza and pasta I had there. The only draw back and it's mentioned a lot is their unwillingness to change any orders, this is because they're consistent with the good every time I go. Please go and you'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"An impressively spacious restaurant that's really hopping on the weekend.  Not too many vegetarian options but what choices there are are delish.  Because of the hustle and bustle, don't be surprised if the service here seems a bit impersonal.

My problem, I've come to realize, is that I often leave Italian restaurants inebriated; this if often my boyfriend's fault.  The room was spinning a little towards the end of the night ... What I can recall is that my pasta really hit the spot: pecorino cheese, green beans and potatoes, slathered with pesto.  

As for dessert, the tiramisu here is too heavy on both the espresso and the cream; quite tasty but not traditionally what I've been used to. 

Great for a date, if you don't mind the crowds!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to go in Toronto. I can't ever leave without going to Terroni. service is always wonderful, the atmosphere is always nice, and the food is spectacular. I order different dishes every time and it never fails to impress me. My favorite dessert is the tiramisu, the best way to end your meal."}
{"text":"This place is a solid italian restaurant, i just wish their pasta portions were bigger :)
I've tried the seafood pasta and the duck ravioli - both very tasty but like i said, could be bigger
The pizza is a great portion size - can never finish it
They have some good desserts - i def recommend the Italian crossiant with nutella nad gelato (i forget the name) 
And I appreciate that their pastas are fresh 
all in all, very tasty and some great Italian food in Toronto"}
{"text":"I used to like this place and I was going there frequently until I found a long hair in my linguine bolognese. The bartender was so kind to replace my plate but this is quite a turn off for future references. 

Ps: they don't have any balsamic. They actually do, but they don't hand it to the customer (?!?) I know it sounds snobby and it doesn't make any sense."}
{"text":"I want to uproot this restaurant and firmly plant it in NYC. It is out of this world.
I dined here with 2 colleagues a couple nights ago as we were in town for business.
Our Toronto colleagues highly recommended this restaurant.
I had to check it out after the fantastic description and positive reviews from them.
The interior was so charming and depicted everything Italian.
For starters, we shared the fried calamari which was very good.
In fact, all the dishes passing by looked very good.
We made it a pasta night and we already knew that all the pasta was fresh and homemade.
Two of us chose the spinach Parpadelle with mushrooms. No red sauce just the simple ingredients of wine, butter and mushrooms to coat those delicious strands of pasta. My other colleague ordered the lasagna with the lamb ragu and he raved about it. I enjoyed my meal with a delicious glass of rose wine.
That night, nearly every table was taken. We took in the atmosphere, enjoyed our food and left bragging about our very delicious and authentic Italian meal.
Until next time!"}
{"text":"Four ladies, arrived 8:20 Saturday December 2, 2017. We added our name to the waiting list, we were told it would be about a 1/2 wait, we would be called by text.
We sat in the bar area to wait. Wonderful staff and service in the bar area. An hour later, still no text. I approached the hostess, and was told \"ya still a lot of groups in front of you, it's going to be a while, and I can't give you an ETA\"

You can't give me an ETA? How did you give me one of 1/2 hour an hour ago???? And why would you not text us with an update after our 1/2 hour wait. 

We decided to keep waiting. Another 1/2 hour later - now waited 1 1/2 hours, my daughter went to speak to the hostess again. Your gracious hostess's response this time - \"ya, see these girls over here, they're ordering take out. Do you live in the area? You should do take out?\"

Are you F***** kidding me, we have waited 2 hours and you suggest we get take out!!!!! 

Where do you find these people?!?!?!?

About 15 mins later we get the text that a table is ready, only to be served by another RUDE staff member, our server. Who angrily informed us that menu items from the bar menu cannot be ordered in the restaurant and if we want \"pasta cacao e pepe\" we should have eaten downstairs.

With everything available in this city, with amazing service, we will never visit Terroni again."}
{"text":"Disappointed. How do they claim to be an Italian restaurant when their pasta is worse than East Side Mario's?

Spaghetti in Canna a Mare (fresh clams and mussels, calamari, scallops and tiger shrimp, light tomato sauce, mildly spicy) for $22.95 - Let me start off by saying that this pasta does not come with cheese :( but that's not even the problem. The pasta itself is SEVERELY UNDERCOOKED. I might as well have eaten the pasta raw and dry. It was extremely stiff and tough to chew on, my jaw was aching after 2 bites. The seafood was also undercooked, the mussels weren't even opened yet. Overall, it was bland. Very bland. There was no flavour to it whatsoever. It's not even a \"light pasta\", it just had no seasoning whatsoever and it really lacked a sauce. I just ate all the raw seafood and left the pasta because I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to digest it. Seafood pasta is my all-time favourite pasta dish and Terroni has ruined it for me.

Tortelloni di Ricotta (handmade spinach tortelloni filled with ricotta and pecorino with butter, sage and parmigiano) for $22.95 - this pasta was very dry but the filling of the tortelloni itself was yummy. Flavours were much better than the seafood pasta, but the mushrooms were very dehydrated and had this weird chewy texture to it. 

Carpaccio di Manzo (hand cut, raw beef tenderloin, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, parmigiano reggiano shavings, arugola) for $15.95 - I am aware that carpaccio is thin, but this was so thin I couldn't even pick it off the plate to eat, making it very difficult to even enjoy this dish. The flavour combination was okay there was pretty much no tenderloin."}
{"text":"The staff members here are rude and arrogant. We received warm water and our waiter seemed annoyed with us when we asked for colder water or some ice. I've been to other Terroni locations and haven't had this problem. Customers shouldn't feel like they're a burden when they ask for simple things.

The food here is great. Although the no substitutions thing is kind of annoying. The building itself is really something - go wander around if you love beautiful old buildings."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic Cucina Italiana? Do you like fresh made pasta and pizza? Look no further... delicious dishes based on Southern Italian recipes. Great wine list that is never stagnant. Vibrant atmosphere suitable for a group get-together with lively conversation. Very satisfying casual Italian dining....my favourite!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most interesting restaurants to dine in downtown!  The decor is great and the old courthouse space makes for good conversation while waiting for your order to arrive. I came here with a large group and we had a room all to ourselves, so the noise factor was reduced quite a bit. It was rammed at 6pm on a Saturday night and there is a lot of seating here so come early if you want a good table.

I thought the service was great and the pizza and pasta were both excellent - I had the seafood pasta and the smoked salmon pizza. The bathrooms are a bit small and cramped but I guess they face the basement problem that most downtown restaurants have here.  I had the chocolate-covered gelato in espresso for dessert - delicious!"}
{"text":"Terroni is one of the most restaurants I've been to. Great atmosphere they've created, front of house is a good spot to grab a drink some finger food and chill in regular street clothes. As you go deeper it gets much more intimate and classier.

Service is exceptional, super nice and very accommodating. They have great suggestions if you're not sure what to get. Wine list is very good, pizza is one of the best I've ever had. Only reason I didn't give this place a perfect 5/5 is I'm not a fan of pasta... And the portion was very small.

But I will defiantly come back and enjoy their amazing pizza and apps"}
{"text":"Service is completely AWFUL. They don't care about making guests happy. 

I'm rating it 2 stars because I like the fact they have a patio... But that's it."}
{"text":"We were looking for lunch on Queen street and stumbled in here simply because it was packed. We figured that had to be a good sign. I am a sucker for homemade pasta.

We started with the olives and bread and I was surprised how stingy they were with the bread.

My compadre had one of teh pizzas (with speck I think) and said it was fabulous. Currently avoiding cured meats, I didn't try it. I had a pasta dish that was twisty noodles with spicy sausage and dandelion (hopefully that is enough for you to figure it out because I don't remember what it was called). I thought it was great -- a little salty (but I think everything is too salty). We were very happy with our experience here. Even though it was busy, our food came fast and the waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"I really loved the food. We had the grilled octopus and the pasta with fresh truffle shavings and it was to die for. The bolognese was great too. The service was only ok."}
{"text":"Very nice building. The space gives you a lot to gawk at. Very hip and a pretty good deejay spinning.

Food was lacklustre."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has an average of 3.5 stars. Yes it isn't a traditional Italian Restuarant but the decor and music were interesting. We had 7 people for dinner and it was excellent! I asked the waitress as I always do, if you were getting electrocuted tomorrow and you had to eat here what would you order? She said, \"the Tonnarelli alla Norcina is my favorite!\" She was right, the shaved black truffles with the homemade spicy sausage, pecorino and garlic was awesome but even better was the homemade pasta. My only complaint was it's not all you can eat like Olive Garden 

In addition, if you don't order the fried calamari, Tagliere Del Salumiere you are missing out. Oh, the bread is to die for if you're not on a low carb diet. Everyone at our table raved about the food so you can probably order anything on the menu and have a great meal. We did not get to the desert but I'm guessing that is insane as well. I should have given them 5 stars but the wine selection didn't have anything from the West Coast and I'm partial to CA and WA wines. 

I just saw they have an LA location, so happy!"}
{"text":"I see a lot of comments saying that this place had inconsistent service! I guess i visited during a good night because my server tonight was fantastic. She was so busy but tried her best to be attentive. Food wise I personally loved it. Italian is one of my favorite kind of food so I visit Italian restaurants really often. This place had one of the best pasta i have ever had. I ordered seafood pasta and it was perfect for me. I ordered tiramisu for dessert and it was so good too. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Food is always fresh and just absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend if you love authentic Italian food. Jus a delight every time I go!"}
{"text":"*service wasn't attentive, a bit pretentious. 
*This location is spacious and perfect for night outs. 

-Frittura di Calamari (deep fried lightly floured calamari) - $17
Though these didn't have that stunning golden brown color to it, don't be fooled! They were quite possible the best calamari I have had in Toronto so far. The squid was moist and tender while the crust were still crispy, a nice squeeze of lemon and a sprinkling of salt, these are set.

-Pappardelle alla Iosa (homemade spicy sausage, button & oyster mushrooms, peas, parmigiano, extra-virgin olive oil) - $18
The pasta was al-dente and though the sausage wasn't as spicy as expected, but for some reason I liked it that way? The pasta wasn't overloaded with too many flavors and in my opinion, when it comes to a really good pasta the key is to have it simple, elegant and key flavors stand out.

-Pizza del Giorno (white pizza with light mozzarella, house made spicy sausage, fresh burrata, and black truffle shavings) - $20?
Gotta love thin crust and the one at Terroni was done just right with a good amount of toppings - the portion was perfect to share between 2-3 people! The pizza was incredibly fragrant from the fresh burrata and black truffle, and it was quite oily but in a good way! I normally avoid white pizza as most places can't achieve that perfect balance between the sauce and toppings, but what I can say, Terroni perfected it!"}
{"text":"I'm so torn on how to rate Terroni. The ambiance is killer from the moment you set eyes on the exterior of the restaurant as it's located in the old Toronto Courthouse. This continues as you step in the doors past glass displays of curing meat along a deli-bar section, past a red carpeted stair case and DJ booth into the seating area...and that's just the first floor. Upstairs is a huge hall with it's very own bar and kitchen. There are a lot of interesting art pieces that make it more than just an antique including the very macabre hanging humans and also a huge modern light centerpiece. With it's loud music, it's the spot to go out for drinks or a fun date. 

That all sounds fantastic but the food is really meh. I shared a polentona pizza as an appetizer which was just bad. It was actually a dry pizza. It was essentially crust with proscuitto and soggy pine nuts (despite lacking sauce and cheese) between that and the crust. Looking at the other pizzas on the menu a lot of them were not in contention to be ordered because they seemed too disjointed and out there. I'm all for being new and adventurous but throwing the kitchen sink at something doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be good. I had the tortellini as my main. This was decent. Good portion size, stuffed full of ricotta and had a good amount of sauce. I took a bite of my friend's pappardelle which was again, really dry. I'm not looking for chicken noodle soup level of sauce but that dish was a big bowl of pasta and I'm not sure how you choke down that amount of dry pasta. One saving grace for the taste buds was the chocolate lava cake. That thing is insane. Again this restaurant is a little weird with its execution of things as there was just untreated fruit thrown on the side of the plate (blueberries with the stems still on them). It just didn't seem to jive with the fullness and richness of the cake.

Anyways the ambiance is 100 but the quality of the food we experienced was hugely hit or miss and ranged from bad to amazing and I do have to echo the sentiments regarding the service (or lack thereof)."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. 

Had the eggplant pasta, I could have made it at home (a lot better)  - was just tomato sauce and cooked eggplant, nothing special at all.

I had made a reservation for 6 girls, got there and the girl who had taken my reservation made an error, so we waited for almost an hour (with my friend who was almost nine months pregnant, she actually had her baby the next day).  There was no regard or compensation for the error that was made.  Don't think I would go again, it's all hype."}
{"text":"Was forced to go here for a family shindig.  I have had loathsome experiences at other Terroni joints.  

The points:

Terribly uncomfortable chairs!  Two were wobbly and broken.  How can you relax and unwind after a long office day when you're constantly readjusting your seat?  You can't.

All 14 people in our party had to arrive before they would take us to our table.  Consequently, there were 12 of us milling around the cramped entryway.  Is 12 people not enough of a sign that we are indeed coming?

Food is mediocre.  Smoked swordfish and eggplant pasta?  What was I thinking?  I wasn't...  The smoked swordfish tasted like microwaved turkey bacon.  Shudder.

$15 for a beet salad?  You betcha!  

Won't split a bill.  Isn't this 2013?  The age of technology?  Why am I using the calculator on my cell phone?

Can I omit an ingredient?  \"We don't do that here.\"

Seated 40 minutes before drinks were on the table.  Not servers fault.  Managers fault!  Who would allow one server to look after a party of 14 and another full section?  

Delicious panna cotta.  

I don't get why this place is so busy.  I guess if you follow trends, you'll wind up here.  I encourage you to investigate your own family neighbourhood gems.  The Ma and Pa restaurant around the corner has gotta (praying) be better."}
{"text":"A great Italian Restaurant!  I had the Full Seabass with head attached for dinner tonight.  Service was great!  I'll be back"}
{"text":"It's taken me a few days to prepare to write this because dinner at Terroni was unfortunately one of the most upsetting meals I've ever paid $240 for. 

Everything seemed great to start with other than a ridiculously undersized table on the patio that did not fit 3 people's drinks, let alone the food we ordered. Our party was going to order waves of dishes to share and started with the calamari, burrata and carpaccio, and a pizza. Everything was ordered and I requested some marinara sauce for the pizza as that was how I wanted it prepared. The server first laughed at me, said we don't modify dishes here, and said it was pointless asking the kitchen to do anything different from the menu.

I asked if the manager could kindly stop by as I was now simply asking for just a side of sauce, not even that they change a dish for me. The manager reiterated that their Southern Italian cuisine (prepared and served by not a single Italian FYI) was authentic and that they know best about recipes and combinations and under no circumstances with they stray from their AUTHENTIC ITALIAN CUISINE. Not even with an ingredient sitting in their kitchen. At this point we had ordered and opened a $70 bottle of wine and another $80 of dishes was already being prepared. 

I could not walk out as we had already invested in this service nightmare of a meal, on a postage stamp-sized table, with the most arrogant \"servers\" I have encountered in my 35 year life.

Terroni - good food is nothing with pompous service and a verbal spit in the face for your customer. I will not return because I can, and do, make all your dishes at home. They way I want them, without your disgusting attitude."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It has an old school feel/vibe which is nice.  I like the food; most pasta items are good.  The fried calamari is very good but very expensive!  It was $17 and so puny!  I wish they would at least add more calamari serving though because it's a total rip off.  For that amount of serving for that price, I don't think it's worth it.  The grilled sea bass fish with salad was absolutely delivious! Again, for its serving, I think it's also pricey, but because it's grilled and fish seemed fresh, it was ok.

I gave it just 3 stars cos their servings is not quite reasonable to me."}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy the food nor the service here.

I came for lunch on a work day, place was pretty filled up. We ordered a pizza and the highly raved seafood pasta. Food came quickly despite how busy iy was. 

Pizza was ok. Just ok. I really can't point out anything I liked about it, or anything I disliked. The pasta on the other hand, was not good. The spaghetti was very undercooked, it was stiff, and almost hard to chew on. It was loaded with a decent amount of seafood, but at least boil the spaghetti longer?

I wanted to pack the left over pizza. I attempted to ask our server for a box or something, and she seemed like she was in such a rush that she didnt notice I was saying something to her..twice. She dropped our bill on the table like it was a hot plate, turned around immediately and walked away."}
{"text":"The perfect little Italian spot for a fresh meal. Everything was yummy. Pasta was fresh but I've had Better fresh pasta. The seafood was better than average but not the best I've had. That said, the cheese and charcuterie platter we had for starters was divine and a large quantity for the price. My frIend had the Bolognese and it was damn good! I also enjoyed the bread served with just plain old good quality Olive oil. I approve of terroni, but it didn't knock my socks off to the point where it will become my go to Italian place- too many other fish in the sea!"}
{"text":"Great service and good people
I love getting their pizza, Bellini and calamari 
Clean and great spot to hang at. 
Many of the customers react a bit snobby to one another but other than that its a nice spot with a beautiful view."}
{"text":"Pre theatre dinner. Made my reservations on line. Great restaurant with that old feel to it. We were seated promptly and our waiter brought us menus and water. Menu had lots to choose from as well as daily specials, which our waiter was ready to offer advice on. 
Freshly baked bread from their own bakery, olive oil and hot peppers was served at our table. The bread was delicious. We started off with deep fried calamari Fresh and delicious. We followed this with pasta made with a lamb ragu and gnocchi with ricotta paired with a glass of red wine. Food was all good but I wasn't a fan of the lamb it was shredded and mixed into the sauce. 
As I sat and watched all the different options that arrived at the various tables around me I knew I will have to come back. One item I want to try is the zucchini Flowers looked delicious.
I have to say the restaurant on the whole is well run. From the moment you arrive to leaving, the staff made every step seamless."}
{"text":"I really like the buratta here is delicious! Was a little disappointed with the duck ravioli but the gnocchi with the ricotta was amazing!! If you haven't tried their croissant stuffed with gelato and Nutella... it's a must! Also their tiramisu is one of the only ones I like in the whole city! 

Definitely a great place to get some dinner"}
{"text":"Ok so I like this terroni location the best because of the amazing food quality. I had the best experience here! The burrata is done differently than the price location and somehow is even more delicious! Also I find this one is more available during the week."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and unique pasta dishes. Love the bread and olive oil as well as their specials. Nice selection of wine, and excellent service. We celebrated a few special occasions here as well as just stopping by for a pizza and drinks on the patio. I recommend trying the lemon pasta!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I consider both the food and the service of an establishment outstanding, but this venue has earned my patronage and my 5 star yelp rating.

We went to Terroni as a group of 6 without a reservation.  We attempted to contact them to make a reservation, but as it was the Monday after Christmas and many groups were still putting together their holiday parties, they were unable to accommodate the reservation but welcomed us to come in as walk in guests. Due to the circumstances, this was completely understandable.

My wife and I were the first to arrive from our group and the hostess was quick to acknowledge that we had a stroller.  Now, I understand the etiquette of dining out.  Although many young parents may argue it should be mandatory for restaurants to have ample space for strollers in their dining rooms, the simple fact is that sometimes despite the best efforts of management, there just is not enough room.  As a new father and as someone who dines out frequently, this does not upset me.  I do not expect the staff to bend over backwards to try to fit a stroller into their establishment, however when a genuine effort is made, it's greatly appreciated.  The hostess offered to put our stroller in their basement and it was a welcomed surprise to see them proactively carry our bulky stroller to their storage compartment downstairs.  
Furthermore, for a packed restaurant that was not able to accept reservations, we were seated within 2 minutes of arrival.

The remaining guests arrived and our drink orders were promptly taken.  One of the other people in our party also had an infant (no stroller) and a high chair was immediately brought to our table with no issue.

Fast forward through our warm, prompt service from our waitress (long haired, young Asian lady), to our food.
My wife ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese and I ordered the Puzza.  My dish was fantastic- but was overshadowed by my wife's entre.  Now, as previously mentioned, I dine out frequently.  But this dish easily ranks as the top 5 pasta dishes I've ever had.  If you ever venture out to this restaurant, this is what I recommend. 

I would also like to talk about the desert, but this review is getting too long and I don't feel like writing anymore.  Let's just say this- we had the croissant with the nutella and gelato and it was phenomenal.

Yelpers- this establishment has my strong recommendation.
Management- if you read this, kudos.  Thank you for a good experience."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Seems like a glorified Olive Garden rather than an Italian restaurant. The food was decent, and that's being generous. Besides that the service was extremely frustrating and slow. It took almost ten minutes for our server to even acknowledge us so that we could ask for cheese for our pasta dishes. Do yourself a favour and pick one of the hundreds of other Italian restaurants in the city instead of coming here."}
{"text":"Delicious pizzas and hanging legs of pig on the wall, what more can you really ask for."}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times and I always enjoy it. The pizza is always perfectly cooked and they have a lot of options, the only thing I don't like is that you cannot change anything on the pizzas. Salads are tasty too, but beware the tuna is a canned tuna not fresh tuna. Ask for the hot peppers for the pizza or to dip the bread in, it is my favorite thing there!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great margarita pizza (mark of a good spot) and spaghetti (another mark). Rest of the menu is also good (but I hate that it's major titles are in Italian cause I have the hardest time navigating the menu and ordering!). Recommend the octopus or mushroom salad as solid starters. And love peroni so always nice to throw one of those back on the patio. Oh what a good patio too!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group on the weekend. I can't believe how big the space was. We actually almost got 'lost' trying to find our friends on the second level. There were about three levels. Great patio as well. 

Service was great but I DID NOT like the auto 18% gratuity (group of 6+). I'm frankly tired of swanky restaurants thinking it is ok to do this. You have to EARN your tips. It should not be automatic. What if our service had sucked? 

I ordered the Ravioli di Zio Paperone (homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano - $19). The portion was not large enough. I had to ask for more bread. But the ravioli was good. A couple of my  ravioli was not fully cooked and everything in general could be slightly tastier but still wonderful with the nice flavours. I don't mind ordering this again except you certainly won't be full after the meal. This is coming from a person who usually has to pack her food home. 

Tried the Calamari alla Griglia (grilled calamari, mixed greens, fresh tomatoes $17). I don't remember seeing fresh tomatoes. The calamari did not come with any sauce. We ended up asking for spicy sauce. It was disappointing. For $17, I expected much more. SKIP THE CALAMARI! 

My hubby ordered a dessert (which I stole half of...) that was SO YUMMY. I don't know exactly what it's called but it had a croissant with gelato and nutella inside. It was to die for. I would come back just for that. 

Awesome restaurant but hate the auto 18% gratuity."}
{"text":"Not impressed except with the decor and different rooms and different floors. And that they can accommodate large groups of 10-12 at one table. 

Fri night the music was good in my opinion as it was late 90s and early 2000s hip hop and R&B but not so loud that you couldn't have a conversation. 

FOOD: 
The olive oil that came with the fresh bread tasted a bit more bitter than usual. 

We got an appetizer consisting of arugula and funghi and it was meh. We also got a Marguerite pizza to share which was nothing special. Plus a gluten free fried chickpea salad with beets from their gluten free menu which was pretty good. 

My pappardelle with spicy sausage was so disappointing! It wasn't spicy and was altogether flavourless. I added the fresh chilies to it and it was still lacking in flavour. 

I tried some grilled calamari and that was good. 

The caramello dessert was delicious. The tiramisu was also just okay for $10. 

SERVICE: 
The service was pretty good. We were seated right away but we didn't like our table in the large dining hall room on 2nd floor so we got switched to the smaller room on the same floor, cozier and closer to the bar. 

For parties of 8 or more it's an automatic 18% gratuity which makes it good and they will split appetizers across all individuals at the table. For Eg you could pay for 0.1 of an app. 

We didn't feel rushed and we spent a good 2.5 hours there  on a Friday night from 8:30-11:00 pm. 

They were a bit disorganized bringing out the food as the kitchen staff and extra waiters didn't know who had ordered what. Communication amongst staff or a better system of putting in the order is recommended to management. It should not be the diners responsibility  to know who ordered what, should it? 

Based on food for value I would say it's over priced as most apps were $20/each. 

Nothing on the menu blew me away. I would only come back if looking for a place that can easily seat a large group on a Fri night."}
{"text":"4 people, 4 pizzas, all delicious!
We went to Terroni last night as a group of four of us and decided to each order a different pizza and then rotate a slice of each to each other. We had the Margherita, the Marinara, the Da Do a Da and the La Pecuri. All were fantastic and between the four of us none of us could agree which two were the best (for me it was the Marinara and the La Pecuri). The service was great, atmosphere relaxed but slightly romantic, I definitely would like to go back here some time soon (but not on a set up ever again :))"}
{"text":"Terroni on queen is the best authentic Italian fix in Toronto in my view.  You can't go wrong with core pasta offering on the menu - parpadelle or spaghetti Cana mare - coupled with a cold glass of Menabrea lager served in the charming garden patio on a sunny spring day.  I've spent some time in Italy but this comes pretty close to authentic taste of the old country.  I also prefer this original location over the summerhill or Adelaide locations.  After your meal, pick up a jar of pepperoncini or extra Virgin olive oil on your way out and also stop by Sud next door for some bombolone or cannoli to cap it all off.   The whole evening under $80 for two."}
{"text":"Terroni is currently my favourite place for a \"nice\" dinner. The food, service, price, and the space itself are all top notch. The restaurant is housed in Toronto's original courthouse, it's a beautiful building with all sorts of cool nooks and crannies such as the prison cells in the basement. The service is friendly and efficient - this place is like a well oiled machine. And, I usually walk out of here only paying about $30-35 dollars per person including salad, main and dessert.

As for the food, I can't say enough good things. Terroni has by far the best pizza I've had in Toronto. Some would claim Pizza Libretto is better but, to my taste, there is no comparison. Do yourself a favour a resist the temptation to order some of the more elaborately topped pizzas and get the Bufalina pizza instead. It's simple perfection: tomato sauce, mozzarella di bufala and basil on a flawless thin crust. I believe this is Terroni's only pizza with bufala mozzarella and it makes all the difference - this stuff is ridiculously tasty.

I rarely order anything other than pizza at Terroni but I have had the pasta and gnocchi a couple times. Both are excellent.

Perhaps most important of all is that you can't walk out of this place without ordering the warm flourless chocolate lava cake for dessert. This cake is probably one of the greatest things I've ever put in my mouth. And that's saying something."}
{"text":"Very good food. I loved the atmosphere. We had a big group and they treated us well. The servers were attentive. I will go back to this place every time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio. I had a pizza and my dad a pizza with spicy meat on it. Service was great and we will go back"}
{"text":"The food at this place was great. House made pasta, delicious wine, and indulgent deserts. What's not to love. My biggest complaint would be the level of music. When my throat hurts at the end of the evening because That's how much I have to raise my voice to speak to the person across my table, that puts a damper on things. I'll definitely opt for takeout next time."}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is delicious, loved every bite of my pasta. We were really surprised with how fast 8 orders came out! The building and the decor itself looks great and the service was very pleasant. 

We also tried the affogato, although they did run out of (chocolate) gelato at the end of the day, the alternative hazelnut was as delicious. Their espresso is amazing. The tiramisu was so soft and not so sweet. Perfectly made. 

They have a great selection of food and will be definitely coming back to try something new."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 star, but the real star of the show here is consistency. The menu provides enough selection for all diners, but doesn't change your perceptions on Italian food or even really delve into any regional identity. Papardelle with meat sauce, cavatelli in ragu, a selection of pizzas, the standard issue. The wine list has all the must-haves and are recognizable enough for those who may not be aficionados. But the nice thing is everything is executed well, the service is good and it's unlikely you could have a bad experience here. My personal go-to is the papardelle with peas and sausage, and they've got a terrific Refosco on the wine list."}
{"text":"VIBE 
So I had no idea there were all of these levels to Bar Centrale. It was a surprise to walk upstairs and see this big, huge room. It was great! I love the eclectic mix of chairs and different table set ups in the room from booths to circular tables in the corner to many deuces. It really adds to the buzz of this place. Service was okay - just in the background for our main server but our other servers were great and they let us stay for a while even after our meal was done. The perfect place to come with a girlfriend , small group or for a first or second date. I would come here for a birthday dinner. 

Note: Bar Centrale and Terroni have the same owner but are two separate establishments. Confusing! That's why the website's menu isn't the same. 

WE ATE
I don't like that the menu online doesn't reflect the actual menu in the restaurant. So I can't tell you the Italiano name for the salad we had. Suffice to say, it was fried mushroom on arugula. For $13, I don't know if I'd get it again but it was good. 

I moved onto the fettuccine bolognese. The noodles were perfectly a la dente and the sauce was meaty. Ideal for breezy transitional fall weather. We drank coke, in the bottle of course! I like the food here. It's simple and reliable. My meal has confirmed my doubts about previous complaints on the chain about their lack of substitutions. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I think this will be on my top ten 2012 restaurant lists. It's definitely one of those \"regular\" spots."}
{"text":"Wow I haven't been to Terroni since my Pre-Yelp days (years ago!), and am asking myself why it took so long to come back.

There's no questioning the resto's success having expanded with other locations, and there's a reason for this.... great food, service, atmosphere, and reasonable prices.

My date and I both went on a Sunday evening with the intention of getting pizza, but as we were being seated, we noticed the in-house made pasta dishes of neighboring tables and decided to go that route.  
Because the pasta is made on the premises, you know you're in for fresh, delicious noodles.  You simply can't go wrong with this option.
I opted for the \"Garganelli Geppetto\" ($17.95) which contained ground sausage, and the unique flavouring of dandelions (slightly bitter, a lot like spinach), with a light olive oil dressing.  Texture was spot on, noodles cooked perfectly and flavour, although subtle was quite good.  I wish the sausage was a bit spicier, but that was fixed with Terroni's ADDICTIVE hot peppers.  FYI you can buy jars of these peppers to take home... highly recommended!   
The lovely lady accompanying me went with a vegetarian option, \"Agnolotti alla Bella Olivia\" ($17.95).  The dish keeps things simple with Mozzarella di Bufala, and zucchini in a light cherry tomato sauce with basil.  I had a few bites of her dish and enjoyed the simple, yet flavorful plate.  Clearly Terroni knows what they're doing when it comes to pasta.

I'll be returning again soon for the Pizza.  My hiatus from coming here was a good thing, as I get to experience it all over again as if it's the first time :)  Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, lovely atmosphere, shockingly bad attitude and service. I love coming here but absolutely hate the wanky service. 

Hot tip, don't ask for too much and you will be happy."}
{"text":"I had such a Terrible Terroni experience I feel the need to write about it. I don't think I will ever choose to eat here again. The service is really that bad.

I was at Terroni on Adelaide tonight before seeing a play. We arrived at 5:15, with plenty of time to get to our show before 7. We ordered our meals at 5:25 with appetizers served promptly. They were good, we ate them. 

Then we waited. And waited. The server came by twice to say our meal was coming. The table next to us that ordered AFTER us ate their food, paid and left. I flagged the server to tell her to bring our bill with our mains around 6:15 because we needed to get to a play by 7. She said our food would be there in a few minutes. Then nothing happened again.

At 6:30 I flagged her down again and asked her for the bill without having received or eaten our mains yet. It was time to wrap things up or we'd be late for our play. She said she had to go speak with the manager. 

6:33 our food arrived at the table. Our pasta dishes seemed kind of dried out like they'd been sitting under heat lamps or something for a while. The speedy timing once we said we were leaving seemed suspicious like the dishes had probably been made for another table and not us. 

The server brought the bill saying she'd comped us for the mains and apologized. We were able to have a few bites because that's all there was time for and then left by 6:40. 

I'm glad we were comped because I didn't get to enjoy what we ordered. How hard is it to make pasta in a reasonable amount of time? I gotta say this ruined my night and I'm hungry because I didn't get to finish my mediocre pasta dish. 

That's my rant. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed.

We are super fans and regulars of Terroni in West Hollywood near where we live. I could eat lemon pasta every night for a month and to be honest - probably would, if not for my husband's desire for variety. Color us excited to have a Terroni nearby for an extended stay in TO. 

There was a wait - to be expected with no reservation. Hostess was very friendly and seated our party on the patio. 

Appetizers took awhile. Not unacceptably long, but it was noticeable. They were not worth the wait. Caprese salad with tasteless tomatoes and a couple of underdressed salads consisting of lettuce and four or five cherry tomatoes sliced in half. 

We sat, having finished our appetizers. Kid getting restless. Ended up taking all of our entrees to go. I eagerly dug in while my husband supervised kid bedtime. This Spaghetti Limone tastes like butter pasta with a couple of capers on the side.

I am a Terroni take out veteran. Taking it to go was not the problem.

I can't even say that the wait on the food really bothered me. The friendly, but inattentive service - ok too. I've waited tables and I know how that goes. But the quality of the food was so far below what I expect from this restaurant.

$150-ish for 3 salads, 4 pasta dishes and a single glass of wine, none of which were outstanding or even very good. 

Canadian Terroni, I will not be back."}
{"text":"unpretentious, high quality italian food. the queen street location has a very different feel than other terroni's."}
{"text":"i've heard many bad things about terroni, but i've never had a bad experience. 

imho, the litmus test of a pizza restaurant is the margherita and terroni makes one of the best in the city. better than queen margherita imho. about the same as mercato. 

just one thing, the relaxed décor of the queen street location belies the price of the food. it's not inexpensive. about $100 for 2. however,the quality is high."}
{"text":"Overall impression entering is pretty good, busy on a weekend afternoon. Was excited when I read all the pasta are made daily.  So I ordered the spaghetti with seafood.  The presentation was good, but the pasta tasted raw in the center.  Extremely hard center with no elasticity.  Totally opposite of what I would expect from a daily made fresh pasta. 

So I asked the waitress to cook it a bit more, she was nice enough to make me another one.  When the 2nd attempt came, the pasta is just slightly better than the 1st; which proves my first assumption.  Also, they did not have a shrimp on the 2nd attempt.  The 2nd attempt pasta was very spicy.  Like hot hot spicy.  My assumption is the cook was probably not too happy when I returned the first dish.  

Otherwise, everything else was good"}
{"text":"I'm glad I came here with a group of friends here. We ordered a few apps (charcuterie board, caprese salad, grilled calamari and octopus), two pizzas (one vegetarian and one with smoked salmon), Italian truffle pasta and a ravioli dish. They also had a wine sommelier in house which was pretty neat. I also really enjoy the music that they were playing - we were really feeling the music so we decided to stay longer and keep ordering drinks after we finish our meal!"}
{"text":"Terroni is generally reliable if overpriced, but last time I went I was served an inedible meal. It was the grilled calamari salad. This is an EIGHTEEN DOLLAR APPETIZER. eighteen dollars--for an appetizer. And it was inedible. The salad greens were so old they were BROWN (see picture). Despite this being an extremely simple dish of only five ingredients, it was missing one of the crucial elements--capers. And finally, the calamari itself was just awful. I don't know whether because it wasn't fresh or it had been over-grilled, but it had that intensely bitter taste that calamari sometimes has. I really couldn't eat it. The server did not inquire if anything was wrong when she took away an uneaten plate of food. It's a shame because I live just around the corner and have otherwise been satisfied with Terroni - I especially like how accomodating they are with kids - but I just can't get over the fact that I paid well over $23 for an appetizer that was inedible. Won't be back."}
{"text":"After hearing much about all the terroni locations, I decided to go to the one on Adelaide. Our server was extremely helpful and suggested a pasta, pizza, and a charcuterie board for my friend and I to share. It was delicious and although a bit pricey, definitely worth it as the portions were huge. I'd want to try more pastas however as that was my absolute favourite thing I ordered from an Italian place in a while! Definitely recommend trying this location specifically because of the atmosphere and service as well."}
{"text":"Also eines vorweg: der Laden ist zwar klein und ähnelt die eines Shops. Aber das Essen dort ist echt klasse! Kann es jedem empfehlen. Klein, aber fein! Service ist auch Klasse! Fragen immer wieder gerne mal nach ob alles in Ordnung wäre. Die Zutaten sind frisch! Die Toppings sind nicht überbacken. Die dienen natürlich als Dekoration und zeigt auch, dass die das Handwerk kennen. Auch die Pasta ist echt gut. Bissfest und bestens gemacht. Zwar eine kleine Portion, aber alles passt. Auch die Ambiente. Also für eine gute Pizza oder Pasta, kann ich den Laden empfehlen. Preislich liegt es in der mittleren Klasse."}
{"text":"My first impressions of this place were \"wow it's busy\" and \"interesting croud\". I arrived ahead of my party and noticed a packed front waiting area with a few people seated at the bar and another table, having drinks. When my party did arrive, we didn't have to wait long though I don't think this would be most people's experience. I heard that Terroni doesn't take reservations but we somehow managed to get seated quickly. Perhaps it was because we were such a large party or perhaps someone had an in. Either way, we managed to get our first round of drink orders in while still waiting on a few from our party to arrive. 
We were seated right beside the open kitchen which threw me off a little since I almost never smelled the aroma's of food wafting from behind me. I would think with menu so delectable looking as Terroni's, you would also have sensory overload having been seated beside the kitchen but I only ever caught tiny wafts here and there. 

The DECOR of the interior is \"rustic\". We were seated at a long wooden table with a huge, thick former tree as the top. There is varied artwork on the wall from a huge map of the world to random neon words/letter. Oh and not to mention the live DJ. After much deep debate and consideration, it was decided that the tacky music spun by the DJ was probably required at blaring noise levels in order to drown out all ongoing conversations on the dinning floor. The tables did offer a good amount of privacy but it can be imagined that with 50 some-odd dinners in one place, it could get annoying to have to hear loud conversations and then shout over them to hear your own party from the other end of the table. With the DJ blaring music then everyone is simply required to shout  over the music to their own parties and in the end you just hear tacky music. 
Voila!


CLIENTELE: Very eclectic crowd. From two guys in business suits to groups of tweens having a birthday party. From well dressed to very casual. From old to young. From couples to families. 

As for FOOD: The menu was very complete! It offered appetizers, salads, pasta mains, steak mains, pizza etc. I opted for Pizze Veloce ($18) which is a basic mushroom pizza. Many others opted for pizza as well with a few getting pasta and one got steak. The portions of the food are greatly varied. If you are hungry get the pizza. It is massive. The pasta portions are small and so was my friend's meat dish which was actually not the dish she had order. Having been starving, my friend had opted for a full steak but what arrived was cut up steak. It didn't look very filling and she wasn't full. Anyone who had ordered pasta was still starving. As for my pizza. It was blah. It really lacked any sense of self worth. It just threw itself together without any pizzaz. I really expected that with such a basic pizza, I would at least get some fresh or ever dried herbs on it but it was so boring. I was dying to see the dessert menu. I have a sweet tooth for anything chocolate and was super happy to see the first item on the dessert menu ($8 all items) was flourless chocolate cake with white ganache. There was also a second chocolatey cake dessert to choose from amongst gelato, tiramisu, panna cotta and a few others. I chose the warm flourless cake and it was delish! It had a molten middle which was rich.

As for SERVICE:  Our server was very nice and accommodating! That being said, she never introduced herself and service kept dropping off as we continued our meal. In the beginning she took drink orders from half the table. She was flagged down shortly after to take the drink orders for the other half. She came back and filled water. She came back again to ask about drinks again and we asked to put in our orders. An earlier appetizer order was never put in. Our bread baskets were devoured when they arrived just before our food started to arrive. Our food was very prompt which was the best part of the service hands down. The food arrived from different servers who also came around with pepper. I can't remember the next time we saw our server but we finally flagged her down for the desert menus and flagged her down again to put the order in. 3 hours after we first arrived we flagged the server down one last time to beg her to let us pay our bill since some members of the party needed to use plastic to pay. 


OVERALL: I would go for dessert. Most likely best to go with a small party. Service was good, food was okay. Nothing special to set them apart and justify their prices but this place was very popular with all types of people."}
{"text":"Mediocre. I really don't understand the fuss. It's as if Torontonians have never had proper Italian food before. Everything from the taste to the service is sub par. You'd have a better meal at an airport Sbarro."}
{"text":"excellent food but I usually find I am most dissatisfied with their flourless chocolate cake... you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a little loud in their main room but the food is absolutely delicious. I love this location so much more than their queen st location. The funghi assoluti and the Natalina pizza are my personal favourites."}
{"text":"What is there to be said about the Italian food mogul Cosimo who came from nothing and now owns three restaurants in Toronto, two restaurants in Los Anegeles, two bakeries and soon opening a collaboration with Cumbraes meat market in Toronto. This man has done it all and where most restaurateurs fall out of fashion quick, it seems as if the Toronto foodie scene has extended Cosimo's 15 minutes indefinitely into the future, removing any sense of ephemerality. I mean speaking about the Toronto food scene, you have to mention Terroni, it is a staple that so many of us grew up with. Prices have always stayed relatively the same, it is not over priced for what you are getting (which is extremely rare in Toronto) and is above all consistent. Terroni I can always count on for a couple things: 1. At least a 1 hour wait to get a table (as a walk in) 2. To have the same level of cooking that has been there since it's inception 3. Rosedale mothers talking to other Rosedale mothers about their country club drama. I never thought that Terroni could surprise me, due to the fact that I have eaten there countless times and had nearly everything on the menu. However, recently I went with my entire family and had the huge bone in steak (40 Oz) that came with a wooden board full of delicious grilled vegetables and of course the usual suspects such as the mushroom salad, nizarda salad, beef Carpaccio, garganelli with black truffle and the smedozata pizza. This experience really changed my perception of Terroni because it showed me the diversity of Italian cooking, something other than pizza and pasta (which is not all they eat in Italy). Terroni is bringing people together with consistently high quality cooking and an atmosphere that keeps the customer captivated. Thank you Cosimo for opening Toronto's eyes to the potential for authentic Italian food at a fair price, there is a reason Terroni is so successful and it is all due to the love you put into every bite. See you next time!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner there...

loved the building, very cool use of an old courthouse.   We sat at the bar so we could watch a little soccer.  

Dishes consumed:   Riccia (arugula salad with mushrooms & big slices of parmigiano) -- delicious.   For me a little too many mushrooms but I just picked around them.

Pasta dish:   Garganelli Geppetto -- dandelions, homemade spicy italian sausage, fontina, parmigiano, extra-virgin olive oil

I wasn't sure what dandelions were but they appear to be similar to swiss chard or collards.   Either way... I was very happy with the dish.   The bartender (Emily) had recommended it as one of her favorites.    I added a touch of the chopped chili's in olive oil and was impressed with the overall flavor, amount of cheese, and heartiness of the dish."}
{"text":"It's a bad sign when a month later I think to myself \"Hey! I should yelp Teroni because it was so bad.\"

Anyway... I went here on a friend date last month and I ordered the steak. The waitress never asked me how I wanted it then brought it out Blue Proper Rare. I cut into it. My friend hysterically laughed. Waitress came back and I said \"you never asked how I wanted it cooked.\" She said \"I guessed\" and walked away.

We laughed it off but this place is grade A trash. Better off stealing a cold striploin from City Market and eating it behind a dumpster on Queen than going here. Cold raw steak waitress out to lunch no thanks."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful! It's comprised of several floors topped with a huge rooftop patio complete with couches and it's own bar! Came here on my birthday to compare it to Pizza Libretto, of which I'm a huge fan.  Every table is served bread and olive oil to start, which they quickly snatch away from you if you don't eat it quickly enough.  They don't leave it on anyone's table to enjoy with the rest of their meals once they get it, which kind of sucked. The pizza is good...just not as good as Libretto's....either is the service.  Servers had small sections but they all take their time getting to and fro.  I would come back solely for the rooftop patio."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for an easy dinner date one Thursday night - -  we made reservations earlier that day at 6.45, and  even though we got there on time,  our table wasn't ready until just after 7. When we were seated, it was on the third floor lounge room in two very low arm chairs.  It would have been good atmosphere for drinks and nibbled,  but for dinner reservations it was awkward and uncomfortable.  The pasta we ordered came out quite fast but was not particularly remarkable."}
{"text":"I'm vegan, so this place actually sucks for food options for me. What it doesn't suck for is food options for non-vegans and atmosphere.

Ignore the long line ups (they move really quick) and make sure you stick around - the atmosphere and food is worth it (even the single non-animal option). 3 good beers on tap (rotates, but always good), good music, good energy (sorry to sound like a hippie), and just an awesome spot to spend some time eating and being with people.

There's a patio out back, quieter seating upstairs, bar seating, and a good sized area downstairs. I've never had bad service and I like that all the clearly anglo folks try to pronounce things properly.

Get the olive plate and ask about the desserts. My wife (before she was vegan) out some chocolate cake thing that is apparently beyond amazing. There are also some delicious and affordable wines on the menu (and expensive, delicious wines too if you're into that sort of thing)."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta is a lost art, so when u are in a restaurant that specializes in exactly that, you must order it.  I love coming here for lunch, the atmosphere is great in this downtown restaurant.  Being as popular as it is, they literally pack in the customers, so brace yourself to be sitting inches away from your fellow diners.  I had the gnocchi, and it was like a perfect cloud, nice and tender in the middle.  My only complaint was the temperature, i prefer my pasta hot.  My sis had the pasta with chanterelles, and i kept eating off her plate. It was a special so i am not sure how often they feature it but it was delicious, again though it could have been hotter.  The food was a four, but the service was terrible.  Our waiter could not have acted any less interested in wrking.   The tables were barely big enough to hold the large bowls, and we were sitting with them emptied on our table for at least ten minutes.  Then we had to get another  waitress to get our bill, bc he was nowhere to be found.  Overall you will get a great meal at Terroni, but dont expect great service."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so good. From the caprese salad with fresh buffalo mozzarella, gnocchi to their pizzas you won't be disappointed. Wine also reasonable- got a nice house red for $50 a bottle. I had a great dessert- warm pastry filled with Nutella & a side of vanilla gelato - yummmm! Doesn't sound like anything special but tasted awesome. Place gets super packed so go early and factor in a wait of 30m minimum or grab a seat by the bar & enjoy!
Great night out, look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Big deception. I had seen this place in the 36 hours in Toronto guide of the NY times and thought that since I was in the neighbourhood it would be with trying. I took their special- rigatoni amartriciana, a classic Italian dish, for which they were having a special programme giving to the victims of the recent Italian earthquake. I thought perfect then I get to eat well and do something good. But really it was not great. Service was fine, but nothing special, pasta a bit too cooked for me (I am a fanatic of real aldente) and the sauce was too spicy. Like a mix with arrabiata but that's a different recipe. The guanciale was cut in too big pieces and wasn't cooked enough so you could feel the fat all over. And never never would you see such big onion cuts in an Italian sauce in the south! Not terrible but if you know Italian cooking don't go, really not worth it (26 Canadian dollars for pasta and sparkling water)"}
{"text":"Spacious restaurant in a former court house, with creepy antique dolls hanging on the wall by something that resemble meat hooks. The wine cellar and washroom downstairs still have the jail doors. The decors in the washroom are eccentric as well, with floral wallpapers in tight stalls, and lion sculpted sinks. The cranked up AC added onto the spookiness.  
We came at dinner time, the place was busy, our food took about 40 minutes after ordering. 
We ordered grilled calamari, some pizzas (margherita, puzza, and napoli) and seafood spaghetti.  We had some biscuits and bread with olives and olive oil to start.  The biscuit was savoury and the olive oil was aromatic, the bread was too hard on the outside and pretty tasteless without the olive oil.  The grilled calamari was neatly presented on a bed of greens and tasted good.  I tried a slice of napoli (anchovies), it had a distinct fishy taste, interesting for a slice or two but a whole pizza would be too much for my appetite.  The thin crust tasted blend and burnt on the edges.  The Italian ham on the puzza pizza was delicious. The seafood spaghetti had scallops, mussels, shrimps, clams and calamari, in a spicy tomato sauce, definitely added a little kick to the dish. The mussels tasted a little off, but overall the dish was not bad.  
Maybe the place has been overhyped for a while before my visit, I found the whole meal was just ok, not worth the price.  Still worth one visit if you like the history and strange decors of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner and I was pleasantly surprised.  Our waiter was courteous at all times and service was prompt. He was patient while taking our orders, refilled our water and brought bread when our basket was empty. When they erroneously charged us for two of the same dessert, he went back and fixed the bill without any issues. 

I liked the overall ambience of Terroni as well.  The music was a bit too loud, however, and at times we had to shout to hear each other. 

The appetizers were delicious - both grilled and fried calamari. 

For my main, I had the Cavatelli which I thought was average. I can't say that I didn't like it, but it wasn't spectacular either. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience, but I thought the food was ok."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed is all I can say. The service here is not good at all, the girl who served us wasn't kind and didn't come to our table (we were party of 6). My salad was very sad that I wanted to cry because it didn't match the description on the menu, it was just cheese and tomatoes and didn't taste Italian whatsoever. I wanted to cry and the ravioli was not fully cooked. I had some of my friends salmon pizza which was okay. She gave me some of her pizza because I barely ate my food on my plate. 

As far as dessert, the hazelnut gelato was good but it won't change my rating of one star just because of my bad experience at this restaurant. 

In addition to, the restaurant is classy but the waiters are dressed immodest and inappropriate.

I'm just really disappointed and I will never come here again unless the menu and service is better, otherwise why go to an expensive restaurant to get low quality food and BAD service."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner last Saturday. Right off the bat I have to tell you that the food was good! 

I ordered a gin and tonic and it was good.

 Funghi Assoluti - loved this dish. Wish there were more mushrooms than greens. The mushrooms were meaty and salty. Went great with the glass of white wine.

Calamari alla Griglia - the grilled calamari was good. It was nicely charred which I love and not chewy. Very tender.

My favourite was the Ravioli di Zio Paperone. Housemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit. I would go back just for this dish.

We finished with the gelato. Got 4 flavours - lemon, pistachio, strawberry and crema.  The gelato had good flavour and it was the perfect dessert.

I can't wait to go back and try the whole menu ;)"}
{"text":"I visited recently with 4 adults and 4 kids over the Christmas holidays. I haven't eaten here since before kids so was excited about returning. We ordered the calamari starter which the kids loved so much we had to add another order. All the pastas and pizzas we ordered were as I remembered, quite tasty. The problem was the service. I'm never impressed when servers try to memorize orders for a large group. He had to come back to clarify one of the orders (not a good sign). Then after everyone was half way through the meal and I asked about my pizza which I never received, the server came back to say they burnt it and had to make me a new one!! Yeah right.. He totally missed my order for sure. Then when he finally brought my pizza he blamed the kitchen again for burning my order. After that, he was hard to get a hold of as he was busy serving another large group. Although I received my dinner after everyone else in my party was done, it would have been nice if he gave me a comp dessert or something. But no, just the bill with built in gratuity. Anyways, I think there are better places now in the city to frequent."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is incredibly busy. Not too surprising, seeing as how their food is of a higher calibre. The bigger name italian restaurants don't really even compare. I am going to say right off the bat that it could be 5 stars, its just that service is incredibly slow...about a 35 minute wait from appetizer to main. 

We started here with a selection of meats and cheeses (Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo- $23). It is essentially their take on a charcuterie board. It is definitely one of the better boards I have experienced and this was largely because of the cheeses. Unfortunately, I can only remember the names of 2/4 cheeses that were included: gorgonzola and pecorino. Notwithstanding, each variety was delicious and with the honey, it was even more interesting. The meats were excellent as well. We had mortadella, capicola, prosciutto and I believe a house made meat. What would have made it even better for me? Having more prosciutto in place of mortadella. There were about 6 pieces of mortadella and only 2 pieces of prosciutto. Also included were some tart and sweet components, olives and grapes respectively. 

Next, we tried two pastas.  First, Cavatelli al Sugo d'Agnello ($20) which is cavatelli with braised lamb with dandelion and pecorino. Second, the ever popular Tonnarelli alla Norcina ($25) which is Tonnarelli with spicy sausage, pecorino and truffle shavings. 

Simply put, the cavatelli was cooked perfectly. I love how this pasta is thick and has a chewy texture. Very importantly, the lamb was not offensive in flavour. It still had that characteristic \"lamb\" taste, but it was more subtle. For myself, the dandelion was unwelcome. I wish I could have, but I was not able to appreciate the intense bitter flavours coming from the dandelion. 

The tonarelli was a great dish. The noodles were perfectly cooked and, as tonarelli should be, are thicker than traditional spaghetti noodles. This gives it even more of the characteristic I look for in all of the noodle dishes I eat whether asian or european- bite/texture! The sausage is uncased so it's more like heavenly ground meat. Along with a healthy dosage of parmagianno, this pasta rich and filling. 


Both pastas were excellent, but the second one really did it for me. It was just so satisfying to eat it!! 

Overall, Terroni was a very nice experience. Along with two drinks the bill came to about $97.00 (excluding gratuity). It is well worth it for the delicious and filling food."}
{"text":"I hated my entire dinner here. We were seated at a table upstairs, beside the bar. There was a small path between our table and the bar. I lost track of how many times servers bumped into my chair. I was bumped mid bite and I dropped pasta onto my lap. When I confronted the server that bumped me, he simply said that it was a bad place to sit and walked away, without apologizing. If it was a bad place to sit, why put a table there?
The food was bland! We had the Margherita pizza, which sucked. We had the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare x 2, which was a let down. I can make better seafood pasta at my house. The only thing that was delicious was the appetizer of calamari, which is the easiest thing to make.
The noise level was so loud that you couldn't even hold a conversation at your own table. I don't understand why they were playing music on top of the noise level."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner at Terroni last night. I will never eat there again.

Their customer service is terrible. This restaurant is all about telling you what THEY think you should eat and drink. When I arrived I ordered a cosmopolitan. They didn't have cranberry juice, and don't make Martini's. My friend wanted asked for a glass of Californian Cabernet. They don't stock wines that aren't Italian, She asked to taste the bartender's suggestion and they don't allow you to taste the wine. When we were told this the bartender was quite rude about it.

We had the cheese plate, beef carpaccio and calamari. They were good. I was very disappointed with my main course. I ordered the duck ravioli. It was disgusting. It was COVERED in oil. My boyfriend had a pizza which was good, bu how hard is it to make pizza? My friend asked for some Parmesan cheese on her pasta and they wouldn't give it to her because it would interfere with the Chef's preparation. 

My friend had pre- arranged a cake. It never showed.

They don't allow separate bills. I had friends who had to leave early, so they put money towards the bill. The waitress neglected to mention this when we were presented the final bill, and the amount hadn't been deducted. Luckily I texted my friend and they told me what try had already given her. Very sketchy!

I can't believe that Torontonians put up with such rude, snobby, neglectful service, and average food from a restaurant that is comparable to a dictatorship. Do yourself a favor, STAY AWAY FROM TERRONI!!"}
{"text":"Love me some Italian food! As long as you are easy going with their funny house rules, you will love Terroni. I go a few times a year with my husband - the service is always friendly, sometimes a bit slow but you can understand if there are large parties etc... We know the sommelier there and he is very generous and sweet. Also, VERY knowledgeable about the lovely wines they offer.

The pizza is amazing! The appetizers are fun and delicious. Seafood is cooked here without any seasonings/garlic etc... so beware that if you don't LOVE fishy flavours.

Most recently, the server passed by at the end of the meal and took our empty drink glasses from us - no offer to get another. Our plates were empty and we were looking at dessert menus. She didn't come back for another 10 minutes. I reallllly wanted some delicious dessert and grapa, but we ran out of time.

We will go back this weekend for that dessert."}
{"text":"I had not seen my friend in a while and finally got down to their place for dinner. We went for a walk and after discussing politics and other world issue we decided on italian for dinner. She immediately pointed out this spot. Said that there is usually a long line but since it was a bit rainy, we can hope that there would be less people. We were right and got right in.

It felt trendy and it was almost like they were lucky to allow us to be there. She recommended the pizza which I agreed. The toppings were strange but interesting. I ordered one which had a strange name which I already forgot. It was REAL italian pizza. none of that fast food bready stuff.  I quite enjoyed. Price was a little high but still, it was very good."}
{"text":"We were at a client lunch and wanted to impress an obvious foodie with good food and wine. Terroni definitely delivered on both accounts. When we arrived the place was already packed, and loud. The old courthouse high ceilings and acoustics made sound ricochet off pretty much everything, so we retreated to the patio.

I love, love, love pasta cooked al dente and the ravioli di Zio paperone definitely delivered in both taste and texture. The mushrooms were flavourful and the duck confit was moist and oh so delicious. I am so keen to try the rest of the menu after seeing my dining companions' pizzas and tonnarelli with generous flakes of truffle. The wine list is expansive and there were varieties of whites and reds to choose from.

The service was the only downside of this experience (minus 1 star), as our waitress took our drink orders almost 40 minutes after we were seated. The patio was full, but not that full where we had to quickly cram in our food orders in with the drinks least she forgot about us (again). The drink orders also came at different time, with our bottle of wine brought after our food had arrived. We were also subjected to her her awkward looks when we asked for Parmesan cheese to be brought for our food. I get it, it's not traditional Italian and Terroni doesn't even want to offer balsamic vinegar least it dilutes the true Italian taste of olive oil or blahblahblah. But come on, let me enhance my carbs with more cheese and taint my perfect olive oil with vinegar if I so choose. Let me live my peasant lifestyle.

My suggestion is to get a seat on the patio if you can, so you can actually hear your dining companions. The food is pretty fantastic and I'll be sure to return again to sample (a.k.a eat all of the) desserts."}
{"text":"Cool cocktails, an impressive wine list, tasty appetizers, fresh pasta, a warm inviting dining room and great service make this place a 'go to place' if you are craving Italian.  Seriously I can't understand some of the lower reviews here? 

Even though this place is always packed at lunch and after 6pm in the evenings, it doesn't affect the service levels or wait times for food (all you have to do is take a peak in the kitchen area to see all the staff that work here.)

Fast, friendly and efficient, this is truly a great Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"SALT & MOOOSH for my Birthday Dinner - FAIL!!!

My boyfriend made reservations for my Birthday dinner at Terroni on April 7th 2018.  Our reservation was for 9pm with a special note included to notify our server (Isabella) that it was a special occasion.

We received barely any welcome at all & were still required to wait 15 minutes for a seat at a crowded table on the 2nd floor so close to the neighbours that my petite 122lb frame could barely fit between the tables to reach my seat.

Drinks to start...or at least an attempt at drinks since there was no Domestic beer available, my boyfriends second choice was a Vodka Soda - nope...they don't have Soda either apparently.  My Whiskey and Coke was served with no lime, no straw, and when I asked for both I was told that the restaurant is now \"Straw free\"...Ummmm...OOOOOK there.

The dry multigrain sliced bread couldn't have been anything further from \"Italian\" and it was accompanied a HORRIBLE quality of olive oil.  I requested black pepper and chili pepper flakes...they never arrived.  My boyfriend asked a table runner for butter...which also never arrived.

We were so crowded in our seats and irritated by the lack of service that we opted to skip the appetizer.

I ordered a long time favourite dish of mine from Terroni - the Ravioli di Zucca filled with butternut squash and parmigiano, gorgonzola sauce with walnuts for $18.95  - which came STUCK TO THE PLATE with DRY edges, and tasted like it was boiled in water from the Dead Sea because it was so salty!  I could not even distinguish the taste of the butternut squash.  Sauce? what sauce? There was none, just a few walnuts tossed on top.

My boyfriend ordered the Gnocchi alla Simi with tomato sauce, fresh ricotta, basil, parmigiano for $17.95 , which might as well have just been potato paste with the most basic of tomato sauces plopped on top.  GREAT DISH FOR PEOPLE WITH NO TEETH OR TASTE BUDS!


Oh wait...HERE COMES ISABELLA WITH THAT BLACK PEPPER I ASKED FOR AN HOUR AGO... I have one bite left on my plate.  Is there a reason why the pepper grinder had to be left directly in front of my face?  We were not asked even ONCE how we were doing or how we found our meal.  Had she checked on us I would have sent both plates back and been on my way.

What a pathetic experience.  I have been coming to Terroni for Over a Decade and am extremely disappointed with my overall experience and am saddened to say that I will never be returning."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday lunch with a few folks and was not really happy with the pasta i ordered. 
I ordered Tonnarelli alla Norcina (Italian black truffle shavings, homemade spicy sausage, pecorino, garlic) which was a quite flavorless and did not taste anything special considering there was a decent amount of truffle shavings on the pasta. 
Service was good but food was not upto the mark.
I have been to Terroni lots of times in the past but clearly this time the food was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"I hate Terroni, it makes me eat. A LOT. 

Everything here seems perfect - courteous servers (they're beautiful too by the way), the food, location and over all look of the place. This is a place to relax and hang out with with good friends. 

The server is slower than average... but that's ok... you're in a group of nice friends. Right? 

The price is just about right, right in the middle of cheap and expensive. I always order the pizzas... oh they know how to make pizzas. Wait, they know how to make tasteful pizzas. 

Burp. 

Their line of pastas isalso excellent. 

There are tons of parking on the street... on Queen Street. Could be quite a hike sometimes... but you'll find parking. After dinner, if stores are still open, you can walk around Queen Street to burn off your carb-fest. 

I will definitely come back. This is my favorite pizza place. *wink*"}
{"text":"I was in town for a work trip and a co-worker who frequents Toronto recommended Terroni for dinner. Working for an Italian company where visiting authentic Italian restaurants in NYC happens on a regular basis, we walked in with high expectations. 

We started off with grilled calamari, the cheese plate, and the cured meats plate. Out of the three, I would recommend the cheese plate. The cured meats came out on a HUGE platter -  this could have been a meal in and of itself.

While the rest of my group went with pasta (most everyone got the duck confit ravioli), I opted for a stuffed fish dish (part of the 'secondi' section of the menu). I am trying to avoid too many carbs and was surprised to find this part of the menu as it's not shown on their website. The secondi section has all meats if you're looking for non-pizza non-pasta choices.

The wine selection was expansive and the bottle we got was so good that we ordered a second.

The prices here are on the high side for the food. If I am back, I will for just the wine and cheese."}
{"text":"Love to go to this Terronis for some salad pasta, pizza and dessert (Affogato!). One of my all time faves is the caprese salad. Fresh and enriched with flavours. Their pasta is freshly cooked to a perfect al dente. Lastly, their pizza is great, just with enough crisp, and well balanced ingredients. Love it! Order their Affogato as it is not openly advertised on their menus (from what I remember). It's one of my favourite go-to places for Affogato!"}
{"text":"I am used to coming here and being greeted with incredible service time and time again. However lately the service has been terrible and the food quality has declined significantly as well. What used to be a high quality toronto gem has become just another mediocre Italian spot. Today after we complained about the service, we were given a whole bunch of excuses about how there was not enough wait staff and kitchen staff to meet the quantity of guests. On top of it all, the cutlery was quite dirty and the cups smelled horribly of eggs. In the future if there is not enough staff the restaurant should remain shut for that day, just a note from a previous frequent fan. Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Unbelievably it appears that the hostesses on the ground floor of Bar Central Di Terroni have actually gotten even more arrogant and useless.  Why it is that I should have to confer with 3 different hostesses on the first floor, second floor and roof just to get a spot at the bar on the roof where presumably no reservations are required is a mystery.  Why it is that the hostesses on the ground floor will tell you that there is a one hour wait when there are tables plainly available in the ground floor bar or patio (again without reservations) is truly beyond me.  I am going to give this place a few more tries because I do love the roof and it is in the neighborhood.  I just don't know how much more of this insouciant incognizance I can suffer on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Server was terrible. She's an older blonde lady, and she had a very poor sense for customer service. She kept us waiting for ages to put in our order, coming around three times but not even making eye contact with us. The food was delicious though, which made up for it. Too bad we left kind of glum from the bad service."}
{"text":"Another restaurant from the Terroni group.  Food is excellent, as is service.  It's a very comfortable place with lots of entrees and small plates.  Great wine selection also.  Would recommend for casual comfortable meal for a few friends or romantic dinner.  Probably would be hard to fit a large group although they are opening a second floor in the spring and look forward to reviewing it."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday early evening. They were already sold out of three out of six dinner specials, which means that, aside from pasta, there was only steak (certainly not Italian cuisine) or pizza on the menu. We started with Zucchini Blossoms. They arrived almost cold and totally without taste. Next the Pork Cheek Bolognaise Pasta which could have been OK if didn't arrive cold. Finally, out of desperation, we finished with a Pizza. \"Pathetic\" excuse for a  Pizza. The crust was totally limp, oily and possibly under cooked. If and when I wind up eating Italian food that isn't good I comment \"this is interesting, this reminds me of Italian food.\" I can't even insult this food harshly enough because it didn't even remind me of Italian food. I actually think this place has a built in crowd because it is close to the Theaters and because they can count on a full house, they think they do not have to produce good food. The waitress was great."}
{"text":"Went back to Terroni after a visit a few weeks back. The salad Verdi and pizza were very good and ample sized this time. The service was excellent and well timed. We would go back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've heard much of the Terroni service (or lack there of) and their pretentious ways so I was ready for upturned noses and side way glances from the 'fashion runway ready' staff members.  We planned on a group lunch with my colleagues as most of us were ready to eat some decent pizza and pastas in the Financial district.  Though it's not in the FD, it's a quick walk from it and I was pleasantly surprised at what I experienced.

When you first walk in, the restaurant environment makes an impression.  As many people already mentioned, it used to be an old courthouse and the 'old bones' are still there.  It's quite grand... sky lights, high ceilings, gorgeous columns and mouldings, artisans bottles of wine, balsamic vinegar, and oil are artfully displayed, and of course, the playful skeletons that are 'hung' (literally noose style) around the upper portion of the restaurant.  The sky lights offer warmth in an otherwise cool black, white, and touch of old blonde wood interior.  Overall, I think it's a great space... it's casual yet has a touch sophistication and hip vibe.  Great place for get togethers and dates... except for the sound level.  Perhaps it's the space and it's popularity but it's quite loud with the tables being so close to each other, it's almost family style seating with strangers.

Our table of 8 was seated within reasonable time before noon.  The hostess was pleasant and was handling already a burgeoning crowd at quarter to noon.  The bar area was half filled and the dining area was probably about 80% filled.  After being seated, the waiter came quickly over and rhymed off the specials and asked for our drink order.  Was he pretentious... nope! Was he warm and friendly?  No... but he wasn't surly or unfriendly either.  He was what I'd expect out of a super busy restaurant ... quick, efficient, knowledgeable, and cordial.  

The menu covers everything Italian you'd ever want... pizza, pastas, insalata, and of course antipasto.  Our table decided to split various things so we can try a lot of items.  We ordered the grilled calamari, fried calamari, baked oyster mushroom, chick pea pancake with a salad, the octopus salad, sausage panini, prosciutto panini, Don Corrado pizza, C't Mang pizza, Smendozza pizza, and another one that escapes my memory (but not my taste buds).  It seems like a lot for our group but the appetizer portions are reasonable so they won't overwhelm one person if they were to eat it by themselves.  I guess you can say they were lighter in volume but not on taste.

The seafood appetizers were really well executed.  My favourite was the grilled calamari.  It was perfectly cook so it wasn't chewy or too mushy either.  It had nice grilled marks for that added depth and the acidity and sweetness of the tomato played it off nicely.  It's simple but tasty.  The hot fried calamari was equally tasty with the nice crispy fried coating ... this was probably the first dish to disappear.  I'm not the biggest fan of fried things but this was good.  The baked oyster mushroom was simple but had great earthy flavour.  The Parmesan cheese  added to the umami of the mushroom and the balsamic vinegar help give it a bit of a sweetness.  The bread crumbs was a great textural difference to the soft mushrooms.  I sadly didn't get to try the chick pea salad as someone at our table at half by themselves while moaning how great it was... next time I guess!  

The panini and pizza arrived in great timing after all the appetizer plates were taken away.  I didn't try any of the panini but my coworkers were commenting how great the proscuitto and sausage tasted.  I was all about the pizza!  These pizzas are thin crust and baked till it has a crispy crust but not a hard plywood texture.  The middle of these are still soft enough that they can't hold the toppings themselves.  I was happy to see the toppings were used in good amounts (none of these nonsense where you only get half an artichoke for an entire pizza).  C't mang is a stand out as it really plays up all the different types of taste.  It was sweet, salty, nutty, and sour in great ways.  The honey and pears seemed odd on a pizza but it really provided a good contrast to the sharp gorgonzola.  The smoked proscuitto (speck) was incredibly tasty as the smoky and salty flavours just jumped out.  The mozzarella gave it that creamy texture on top of the crispy crust. The walnuts were used sparingly but when you did get one, it had a nice nutty flavour that worked with the honey.  Honestly... I didn't think this would be great but it was one of my favourites of the lunch.  Don Corrado was my next favourite.  It's another white pizza with mozzarella, rosemary, gorgonzola, thinly shaved potatoes, and spicy sausage.  

Overall, it was a very enjoyable lunch with efficient service. It has memorable flavour pairings in a great environment and close to work!  It's more expensive than food court food but Terroni food is miles beyond in quality & taste"}
{"text":"I agree with Meira E. (Feb 28, 2013), Terroni is a nice restaurant if you know what the expectation is before you go. The decor is done very well with a great degree of attention paid to details. Terroni is pricey though at $17 per pasta on average and you do have to flag down the waiters. I ordered Spaghetti al Limone ($17) and upon sampling it, was left with an inescapable thought that I had to eat something I didn't like the taste of from the beginning. The portion was quite small too. My girlfriend had a different pasta, which she liked, but then she's not very picky unlike me. I don't know if I'm going to give Terroni another chance. Perhaps, if I were with a group of people and I was craving a pizza, I'd consider Terroni, but if you're a couple looking to have some pasta, you might as well spend $50-$60 (2 pastas + drinks + taxes) somewhere else."}
{"text":"Yay, Terroni! I have been to their Adelaide street venue a few times, but I finally got a chance to visit the Queen West location this week.

We strolled in here early (around 5:30pm) and it was an easy time to grab a table. The bar area had quite a few patrons who had stopped in for a pint or glass of wine after work. (By the time we left at 7pm, there was already a queue of people waiting for tables)

Terroni on Queen is quite a bit smaller than the Adelaide street branch, it's a little bit more intimate. I would say there are no more than 15 tables.

I always stick with the pizza (I never order pasta out, somehow the thought of spending $15-$20 on a bowl of pasta sends shivers down my spine)

For this particular dinner we tried out the Puzza (a white pizza with mozzarella, mascarpone, gorgonzala, mushrooms and italian ham) and also the Peppino (tomato, garlic, grilled eggplant, zucchini, grilled red peppers and parmigiano). Both were DELICIOUS.

The thing I love about Terroni pizza is that it really is nearly bang on to what I remember eating in Firenze, Cinquo Terres and Pisa on a few vacations to Italia. The crust is paper thin. Ingredients are extremely flavourful but they are placed somewhat sparsely overtop of the pizza (unlike the mounds upon mounds of greasy toppings you get at a fast food joint).

The service was A+ at this place. Our server knew everything - gave us detailed information about the wine list, the beers on tap, plus interesting information about the food once it was brought out. They had a lot of serving staff on hand and our server came back just enough to check on us but without being annoying.

I wish the pizzas were a few bucks cheaper (most are $15-$17) but other than that, I can't find anything  else to fault Terroni."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Terroni location because it's HUGE and has amazing decor.

We were seated in this excellent private area at the back which has a large table that can seat 12. I recommend requesting this room if you have a larger party because it's AWESOME. It's decorated nicely and has a fireplace and bay window looking out the back courtyard. It's sort of like being in Nona Papparelli's dining room.

The service here is excellent as is the food quality. I love their pizzas - very thin crust so I can devour the entire thing without feeling TOO gluttonous. The quattro staggioni is my favourite. Pizzas are priced from $13-$19.

My only problem-o is that I'm quite cheap and they have no cheaper wine options. The wine list is HUGE but the cheapest bottle starts at $45 and they don't offer many 1/2 liter options either. So price is moderate if you aren't drinking, but really adds up even if you want a glass or two of wine."}
{"text":"Very busy Italian place downtown spread over 2 levels. First I will say the lamb pasta I had was quite good, the meat was tasty and of good quality. The selection of items on the menu was quite good and their pizzas looked very tasty. However overall I was disappointed particularly with the service. 

It was very busy but didn't seem to unusual, it was a normal Tuesday in March but the server seemed particularly rushed off her feet to the point of being neither particularly friendly nor attentive. The wine by the glass is served in quite small portions given the price; I was never offered pepper or cheese; not offered coffee or dessert, and not once did she check upon me during my meal to see if I was satisfied. Finally, when the broken credit card machine left me waiting over 25 minutes to pay my bill there was no apology or offer of any compensation. 

Overall good food, iffy service."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm back home in Toronto, I must make a stop in at Terroni. I love the feel of their Adelaide location.  I've always had great service and awesome food here.  

This time around, I ordered my favourite Bucatini Amatriciana with a starter of the Funghi Assoluti which is always a favourite!  I love the simplicity of their food and the fact that I always leave filling full!

Love Terroni and can't wait for something like it to come to Calgary!"}
{"text":"Ate here with about 6 or 7 of my friends and the food was absolutely stellar. The service was lovely and very subtle. Didn't feel like the waiter needed to be part of our experience but made the whole experience so seamless and pleasant. I love when waitstaff isn't overbearing and in-your-face!! 
The wine was recommended to us by the staff and was perfectly paired. 
I will definitely be back for more. The wait time was worth it. Seriously."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for my cousin's 29th birthday. They actually handled the 16 of us really well. I think Terroni's does big parties well, as there was numerous large parties around us. 
We were seated at 2 long table beside each other. Hard for talking to everyone but obvioulsy better for space. I love round tables for groups but 16 is a big one!
I warned the ppl that haven't been there that they don't make substitutions (esp dressing on the side for salads) but the waitress showed us the salads they actually do put the dressing on the side. I couldn't stay the whole night so I had 1 bellini, 2 glases of white wine and the Ricchia Salad (arugola, fresh mushrooms, parmigiano reggiano shavings, lemon $9.95). 
There is parking right across the street which was $4 maximum on Sats (great!)
I've been here 4 times now and I have yet to see it not busy. One of my offices are right beside it and I'm here Thursdays so I am making it my goal to come Thurs post-work for drinks/dindin!
Def try this place if you're debating it!"}
{"text":"In an attempt to satisfy my hankering for some authentic Italian food I went to try this place out. Called ahead to see if there was a lineup to decide which Terroni I should go to. The guy told me there was no line (but that could change). When we got there 20 mins later a lineup had formed to the door. The hostess said there would be a 10 min wait but we waited about 25. I'm not going to fault her because its hard to judge when people leave.

This place was busy at 6pm. The tables are fairly close together to try to accommodate all the small parties. Luckily for us we didn't get seated by one of the 3 tables that are situated right alone the lineup.

As for the food I would say I enjoyed it. It has been a long time since I have seen gnocchi on a menu that didn't come from the freezer; it was actually fresh made (or close to it). Couple that with some authentic tomato sauce and you have a satisfied my craving. My wife had the Puzzo pizza and enjoyed it a lot. For an appetizer we shared the carppacio. The dish didn't knock my socks off but I did enjoy it and would get it again.

Our server was very cordial, pleasant and attentive. Other servers brought our food to the table which gives me the message that food isn't sitting waiting to be served to long.

4 stars about sums it up for me. I am a fan, it's better than average, but not quite the best. I will also be returning."}
{"text":"I liked the Adelaide location but this one did not make it. Place is spacier but pizza was just mediocre and waitress was totally bland (not advertising the daily specials or gently commenting on choices to optimize the experience... only interested in selling sparkling water!)."}
{"text":"very large menu, very good meal, quick and effective service, nice setting... perfect?"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Terroni I wondered what all the fuss was about. I didn't return for 5 years. Recently, I have lunched at Terroni twice. Both times, I was pleasantly surprised, but not bowled over. The calamari was pretty fantastic and the pizza's are very good indeed. The service was polite but not friendly, and the food came quick enough for a leisurely lunch, but not a good choice on a lunch break from work. 

To me, Terroni is the devil you know, it's good, but not incredible and is a better choice than a lot of the other restaurants in the neighborhood. Would I go out of my way to visit Terroni? Not likely."}
{"text":"Food was decent, I really enjoyed their thin crust pizza. 2 stars because of TERRIBLE service. How do they sit patrons at the UNCOMFORTABLE bar area when we made it clear we only wanted to dine and not drink? The wait time was 45 minutes. We waited and got seated at the bar and when I requested a normal table (there were about 4 empty tables in my plain sight) the waitress refused and said it would be an additional 45 minute wait to be added back on the wait list for the table. How does this make sense when I already waited 45 minutes to be seated at the odd bar area to eat pasta and pizzas? I told her to put me on the wait list for the table because the bar was THAT uncomfortable. I ordered food, ate and stayed for about 1.5 hours and during that time, she NEVER called me back to get seated or offer me the table (even though I would have turned down the offer after already eating my dinner) just disappointed that they didnt even bother to try. Too pricey for terrible service. Food was decent, same owners and food as SUD, might as well skip Terroni."}
{"text":"Terroni located at Adelaide and Church is the best location.  There's another location but I heard it's not that great but I've never tried so I can't comment.  I ordered a Bellini and my boyfriend had the recommended German beer. Apparently it's the best beer he has ever had! The Bellini was amazing. Appetizer we had the fried calamari so fresh and delicious. They gave us complimentary bread with olive oil. We got a side of fresh chilies with oil so good! For my main I ordered the spaghetti canna mare which is seafood pasta with tomato sauce.  It has a kick to it, a bit spicy. My boyfriend has the Sausage pasta with garlic olive oil. Both dishes were amazing since their pasta is fresh.  I come here frequently for lunch and dinner and Terroni has never disappointed me. A definite must try.  I was too full but I had their tiramisu before and it was amazing! Also the service was terrific.  Our server was so energetic and so happy. He made us have a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I've bean a fan of the Terroni location on Queen West. I am less of a fan of the new place on Adelaide.

The Sofia pizza (mozzarella, sweet genoa salame) was a good portion for $16, but the salame itself was not great, and in addition it was way too salty. The pasta was OK, but nothing outstanding. 

The place itself is quite attractive. It's housed in the historic York County Court House (1852-1900.) In fact, the wine cellar and even washroom seem to have been fashionably converted from old holding cells! The restaurant is quite big with several different rooms. It's also quite bustling on the weekend with young and hip clientele. It seems like a fine place for dinner and drinks with friends, or even for a first date. However, I'm not sure that the food is quite on par with the décor. 

I have one other complaint: in the front hall there was a rather pungent unpleasant smell possibly coming from the adjacent wine cellar. I hope that they took take care of that."}
{"text":"This is not a good place for vegetarians. I ordered the ricotta pasta (not sure of the actual name) and it was over $20 and took me less than 10 bites to finish. I do not even eat a lot and I found the portion to be ridiculous. Despite the portion, it did not taste good at all. The pasta was barely cooked and there was no flavor. Extremely disappointing. As if that wasn't bad enough, the caramel pudding was mediocre and nothing special. The drinks were not strong at all and didn't taste good. I had their terroni special tea and even that did not please me. Do not choose this tea as it has an awful bitter taste which I found quite strange for chamomile tea. Of course, the teacup was minuscule and the pot of hot water was just as tiny. I will never return and never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is great. Both the pario in the back or the high ceiling by the fireplace seating. The price is right too"}
{"text":"Ordered the Margharita pizza last night and thought it was pretty delicious.  I typically order few toppings for my pizza bc I don't like how the toppings can overload the thin crust.  They pizza was pretty skimpy on the basil.  But, the crust and mozarella cheese were amazing.  I only wished that there was slightly more marinara sauce.

Next time, I will try the pasta."}
{"text":"My first restaurant out in Toronto and this was quite the experience. This place gives you a nice welcoming feel and has some really nice decor. The bathrooms are designed like a jail cell and the restaurant itself looks like Italy (so i was told, i've never been). The staff was super friendly as well. 

I absolutely loved the pasta! I got the Black Truffle with spicy sausage pasta and this was probably one of the best home-made pasta's i've ever tasted. You can tell the pasta was made fresh that day! 

We also had a platter of cheese and breads that came with some prosciutto, sweet pear, walnuts, honey, and other stuff. Delicious! 

Next we ordered an arugula salad with some cheese on top and i'm not sure what dressing they used but it was some crazy good arugula! 

Lastly we ordered a lava cake and a caramel shot of something, they were delicious. I'm not a big fan of sweets but it was amazing! 

For one of my first restaurants out in Toronto, this was definitely a great start! I can't wait to explore other fantastic restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We got one of the spicy Italian sausage with grilled eggplant. I thought the pizza was delicious. They didn't have a lot of variety of beer."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I can't give enough stars to Terroni. This was my favorite dining experience of 2012, and it was completely unexpected. 

My wife & I were visiting Toronto and were recommended Terroni by a friend from Toronto. We walked by at about 930pm on a Thursday and were stunned by the aesthetics from down the block. Situated in a gorgeous Courthouse building in the middle of a robust downtown, it just felt either white glove or four star prior to entering.

Walking through the bar area (laden with Italian wines, oils & meats, but tastefully/authentically presented), we were able to snatch a table for two in the somewhat-crowded restaurant. The seating area was not so much upscale as unimposing chic. Italian chic is hard to pull off, but the simplistic, sturdy wooden tables with thin, stylish chairs in an airy, vaulted environment added a degree of sophistication to the restaurant.

We were greeted by a very amenable server who brought us out a wonderful spicy olive oil for our bread, as we ordered the margherita pizza. The wine arrived, the server's demeanor maintained, and we laughed & enjoyed the entire meal, feeling completely at home in this quasi-upscale environ. 

The pizza was Italian pizza at its simple best. Thin, crunchy warmth with a layer of true tomato, handmade mozzarella & full leaves of thick basil. We finished the remaining spicy oil with some of the thin crust, and ordered two pastas: Garganelli Geppetto and Pappardelle alla Iosa. Each is a handmade noodle, and both were elegant, featuring dynamic flavors and an underlying freshness.

As we amused ourselves with the wine, the replica of the Autodromo Nazionale suspended from the ceiling, the puppets representing the classes of Italians & the full sized map (satellite view of the world at night), we wrapped up our meal happy & content, feeling as Italian as one can in Toronto. 

On our way out, we thanked the server and complimented the overall feel of the restaurant, and she encouraged us to \"check out the jail cells\" downstairs. She escorted us down to the real jail cells (this was a courthouse, remember), which are now used as wine cellars. 

Really, really cool place and highly recommended. Restaurant of the Year, 2012."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been back at Terroni's...I'm glad it's still looking as romantic as it used to be. Love the sky window on the high ceiling!

To be honest though, I find the price point for this place to be on the pricey side, especially for the appetizer and cocktails. My bellini was 9 dollars, but came in a tiny champagne flute.  The beef carpaccio was about $16 and the pizza was also $16. The pizza is thin, with minimal tomato sauce, large slices of spicy salami, and round uncut olives. The look of the pizza just felt unpolished. Nevertheless the food was very flavourful and the overall experience was enjoyable. Unfortunately, it's not somewhere I'd suggest to go to."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a beautiful atmosphere. Really kind servers too! Incredibly expensive however. I ordered a garden salad with literally just greens and balsamic and some tomatoes which was around $9 (not too bad), and had one glass of wine and some water but when the bill came I was charged $1.66 for spring water, and some how my bill came to $44. I couldn't even read what I was being charged for because it was all in Italian. If you don't mind spending an arm and a leg for great food this is the place for you, but probably won't be going again if I'm the one paying."}
{"text":"first terroni i'd been to.

they're all nice though.  

not crazy about the layout.

just had ouzo at this location, but at the Queen West West one, I had pizza and caprese salad and they were very helpful and tolerant of the two toddlers we had eating with us."}
{"text":"Second time in this place and it never disappoint me. The restaurant building is so unique and old, the food is amazing and so delicious, staff are so friendly."}
{"text":"Excitingly, I found a Mealshare dish in the wild! 

I liked the ambiance of this location immediately when walking in. My friends and I were seated on the second level, and I LOVED the bar and how it looked - all wood and warm lights. The washrooms are located on the third floor and are gorgeous (floor to ceiling windows, white marble) and there's many patio spaces available. Definitely my idea of a summer drink locale.

From the menu, we ordered Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo ($19), which had cured meats and cheeses. Not the most generous serving I've witnessed, but the prosciutto was beautiful. They really could have had a few more slices of some basic bread to go with the board. 

The mains, we ordered the Mealshare option from the daily special, which was pizza with ricotta cheese, arugula, walnuts, figs and proscuitto. Loved it! And was happy to explain to my friends what Mealshare is. Also ordered the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare ($21), which is seafood spaghetti. This was just...ok. If you weren't eating the mussel or clam itself, the spaghetti is just spaghetti in tomato sauce. Also ordered the daily ragu, which was wild boar with papparadelle pasta. Great dish - nice and hearty.

For dessert, we girlies split the pistachio gelato.

Overall, the food and ambiance was great. Loved the menu and appreciated the daily changing menu. I will definitely be back to take advantage of the patio! Service was fine - professional, but definitely not overly friendly or warm. Just....professional."}
{"text":"Did not order first time eating here. Friend ordered and food was delicious. The meat plate to my main course oh my. 10/10 would order again if I found out what I ate. Dessert had mint tea. Loved it. Price is not bad I don't mind. see you again terroni"}
{"text":"I came here last night with a group of 8.  The place is big, with many tables, there were a lot of people waiting for tables when we came in, and the place was packed.

I agree with most with regards to the service.  She did not seem too friendly, a bit annoyed (for no reason).  And she forgot to bring my second beer, and even after I reminded her she came back and said the keg exploded and I just told her to forget about it.  

The food is mediocre, and yes you have to cut the pizza yourself and I believe others when they say they are not allowed to put parmasean on their pizza.  

The only thing that makes this place good is the fact that there are so many other people there, and so many other people like it.  It has that \"status\".

Derek"}
{"text":"The evening didn't start well. Five of us were there to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a reservation for 8 pm. We were made to wait for 35 minutes despite a reservation. On top of that, it was so warm in there, that it was almost hard to breathe. Plus they squeezed 5 of us on a table meant for 4. Not comfortable.

So why the 4 stars you ask? Quite simply, the food and an apology. The food was absolutely delicius. I had the pasta with spicy sausage, mushrooms and olive oil. Delicious. I took a bite of everyone else's food, and the pastas and pizzas were really very good. Loved the ravioli and the specials.

I'd still have given it only 3 stars because of the wait and the uncomfortable seating, had they not been very apologetic later and given us a free platter of 4 desserts - molten chocolate cake, pana cotta, gelato and tiramisu. And I must say, they were all delicious. Yeah, so they bribed me for an extra star. I'm not above that.

Another funny thing though as others have mentioned - they don't do individual bills. If you've ordered similar to others at your table, you can just split the total amount on your cards.

Will I go again? Yeah - lured by the lovely pastas."}
{"text":"Always a great meal and a fun night out, though sometimes too busy and not enough privacy due to crowded tables. Like it a lot, but consider it slightly overrated"}
{"text":"I love Terroni. Yes, the lines can be aggravatingly long. Yes, sometimes the service is a little sloppy or non-existent. Yes, they can and do refuse your requests if it's something that is un-Italian (like putting parmigiana on seafood pasta -- Italians in Italy don't do this and they would be aghast if you suggested it). And yet, none of this matters to me.

The pizza is as good as you can get without being in Italy. My dear friend from Italy introduced me to this restaurant as this was the only Italian restaurant she thought was worth eating. Terroni was good enough for her to bring her friends who had just arrived from Italy. The panna cotta with the balsamic reduction is perfection. So smooth, creamy, and subtly sweet with the slight tang of balsamic. Mmm . . . sometimes I dream of that panna cotta."}
{"text":"This is a favourite spot! Make sure to book ahead it's busy busy and they wait could be very long if you don't plan ahead. Try the bubbly red wine - trust me!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner here. Ambience was good. I had the ravioli. It was great! It doesn't look like there's a lot but it fills you up. My friend had the pizza and she enjoyed it. 

The waiter however was a disappointment. He didn't seem to be enjoying his job too much. Emotionless. Stone cold. And when we asked to split the bill, with multiple credit cards on the table, he just put a sum total to one of them. Wtf? Then we asked him to split the bill. He said he didn't know how to split it and said we didn't tell him earlier ..

Foods good but waiter killed the experience."}
{"text":"This establishment is a hit or miss with most people; for me it's a hit.  For the most part service has been great and food, wonderful.  The thing about dining is that you have to understand it's an art.  You can ask the artist to make changes but you also need to respect that the artist if they choose not to.  Secondly, those with dietary restrictions--in a perfect world you'll be able to get what you need everywhere; it isn't a perfect world... Understand that YOU a person with restriction(s) should call or ask (not expect) if there are suitable options.  If you are bringing outside food in, call and ask if there are plating fees or if it is allowed--this is just a courtesy.  

Sometimes staff can be rude and pretentious--absolutely not cool.  I have yet to experience this but not surprised that this can happen... 

Anyhow, I have been a patron at Terroni for a long long time--since I was in high school going to the Queen Street location and what I love about their food is the simplicity in the flavour and ingredients--quality and not over the top.  It is definitely not a 'quantity' type of place but rather quality.

This week I have dined in and still love the food!  To a point where last night I ordered a take away pizza (my fave CT Mang--not for the faint hearted  or those who does not like gorgonzola cheese).  All in all, I was not disappointed.

Price is on the higher side but, you know what you're getting into if you choose to eat somewhere.  

I highly recommend this establishment; just put away expectations and enjoy the ambiance, your guests and the meals that come with... ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best pizza places in Toronto. Not only was the staff uber friendly our waitress was very accommodating to our needs. Highly recommend if you're craving delish pizza!"}
{"text":"There's 1 downside. We were outside since the weather was really nice. Since we had a large group a couple members of our group were stuck sitting in the Sun. It would've been nice if they made arrangements for them.
On the positive side, the food was amazing. I normally get the pizza from there but today I decided to go with the pasta. This was the best decision because it was really amazing.
I highly recommend this restaurant & you'll definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Waited 45 mins for wine, after asking/reminding people twice. server has come by twice in an hour and  a half. Food is great but this service is pretty horrible."}
{"text":"I was not too fond of Italian food but after being brought here, it sparked my interest for it. This place is huge - we're talking about three floors here! The top floor is of course the beautiful patio that's perfect for the summer! Very beautiful decor and comfortable ambiance. 

For my very first time here, we ordered the Garganelli Geppetto and a prosciutto sandwich. LOVED the pasta and the prosciutto sandwich was just delicious! On another hot summer day, we came here for lunch and ordered a Spinoza and Terroni Sour. I must say, from all of the cocktails I've tried these were different; distinct in taste and just... you gotta try one for yourself. Comparing the Spinoza to the Terroni, it is much \"heavier\" or rather, \"musky\" in taste. I loveee the aftertaste though, there's a hint of spice in it. Do not get foolled by the Terroni Sour because it is not sour at all! It is however, a distinct taste I'd say but very refreshing. As for food, we ordered the Calamari alla Griglia, Pappardelle alla Iosa and Funghi Assoluti. 

I absolutely LOVED the grilled calamari. Although it is an appetizer, it's perfect as a full meal for those who prefer something light. It is pretty much a salad (mixed greens + tomatoes) tossed with some perfectly grilled calamari. The balsamic vinegar brings everything together nicely for this dish. The Funghi Assoluti was delicious as well. It's a salad comprised of baked oyster mushrooms, arugula and tossed with balsamic vinegar. The baked oyster mushrooms was not bland at all; it's got a bit of a smokey flavour to it and had a nice crunch to add texture to the overall dish. Lastly, the pasta we had was.... A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Love, love, LOVE their pasta mainly because of the texture and tenderness of it. It's nothing compared to any other pastas I've had. Superb!

Lastly, dessert. What is a meal without dessert?! We ordered the fried dough with nutella or house jam and vanilla ice cream on the sad. Lovely presentation however, after a few bites it got a bit too sweet. The dough was pretty much a doughnut that's lightly sweeten. Oh btw, if you're planning to order this thing you should ask for either nutella or their house jam otherwise, without a decision, you will have served nutella automatically. 

Overall, consistency is always here and service is prompt. Will definitely be back for some more pasta and cocktails!"}
{"text":"Came to the one on queen because of the patio. Tip, always make a reservation! Originally wanted the patio but it was cold and looked like it was going to rain. Unfortunately, the restaurant was to packed the hostess couldn't move us in, but assured us we could be moved in if it started to rain. Don't know how that would happen cause it was so packed and it did rain and no one from the patio was moved. We ordered the Ravioli di Zio Paperone and Smendozzata pizza. The Ravioli sounded amazing fig, duck confit, butternut squash - yes please! Unfortunately, I couldn't taste anything but duck and the pasta was under cooked. The pizza was okay, we did enjoy the thin crust, but the gorgonzola (our fault) was too strong for us. Overall, I was expecting more because of the reviews, but it didn't live up to them which was sad, because my boyfriend and I missioned to try out this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for sure, but disappointing food overall. It certainly isn't worth the price. The idea is tapas-like with the guests ordering several small dishes to make a complete meal (this is how it is actually done in Italy, they just approach it funny). Overall, great for an occasional night out."}
{"text":"Good food, sh*t service by Cassandra. I don't go for dinner with a group of friends to have to sort my own bills out after a bottle of wine. Good wait staff know their job and are not lazy. There a better restaurants with top notch service out there."}
{"text":"Had friends from out of province visiting and this was top on my list as the old courthouse has some of the best interior design in the city. Great ambiance with hip hop music playing in the background. Arrived for dinner on a week night, reservations recommended but not necessary for small groups. Extensive menu with a huge pizza selection and daily specials. Average to higher prices but excellent service. 

Ordered the special ravioli di malale (with braised pork) and pesto. It wasn't amazing, the pesto tasted a bit bland and could have used a bit more garlic. The ravioli was pretty standard and slightly chewy. But the Tonnarelli alla Norine was delicious! Generously covered in black truffles, it was filling and flavorful with each bite. The pastas are generally more chewy which was perfect to my friend's liking. 

Tiramisu was not special, probably wouldn't order again but the hazelnut gelato was amazing. So rich and creamy, immediately regretted ordering my go to Tiramisu. The menu has lots of options which brings me back every time. Would really say 3.5 stars but can't give half stars on here."}
{"text":"A friend was in town for NXNE and met someone who worked here, who said we \"had\" to go. I wish to high hell he hadn't listened to her.

To start, I arrived and gave his name, since we had reservations. The hostess informed me he was at the bar. The bar ain't that big and no, he wasn't there. Actually, he hadn't arrived at all - he'd called to confirm the reservations (hours earlier) and they marked him as present. Hunh?

When they seated us, it was in one of the noisiest restaurant rooms I've been in without a band playing (thank g/d for the lack of band...). We had a server try to take our order twice, and our bad - we hadn't seen each other in years and were a tad distracted catching up.

We finally gave our orders, and things went downhill from there.

I asked for a Diet Coke and was informed, with a sneer, that they had only regular Coke or sparkling water. I got the feeling that was what they carried, not that they'd run out of anything else. Way to serve your customers... I gave in and ordered the Coke - full price for a bottle so small it fit into the palm of my hand.

When the bread arrived, I asked for butter. Same sneer, \"we don't have butter.\" I don't like oily bread,and have been asking for butter in Italian restaurants for my entire life all around North America. That's only the second time I've encountered one that \"doesn't have\" butter. Two strikes for an inability to serve your customers.

The food... I wish I could say the food made up for it. My friend ordered something pasta he mostly enjoyed. My pizza? Awful. Weird, powdery texture, dry, and absolutely tasteless. After one piece I stopped eating - it was so bad I'd lost my appetite.

I didn't send it back. I acknowledge that's my bad - I could have. But as we never saw our server again until we literally had to jump in front of her two hours later to get the bill (what happened to the quick run-by and \"How's everything going\"?), she clearly never noticed I wasn't eating - most decent restaurants, the server will say \"Is everything OK?\"

When she finally did clear the table, I mentioned the pizza was \"not good.\" She lectured me that had I said something earlier she'd have brought me something else. I explained that I'd lost my appetite, and she just rolled her eyes at me.

Again, in a good restaurant, they'd have taken an entire uneaten meal off the bill. I didn't ASK them to (my friend was paying), but I wondered if their customer service policies meant they'd do so.

They didn't."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked into Terroni was an overwhelming smell of fried fish. The second thing that hit me was the noise. I had made a dinner reservation for two at 6:00PM on a Wednesday evening, and it was already packed with people when we arrived. We squeezed into a tiny table and did our best to maintain a conversation without being drowned out by the voices on either side of us. In fact, it was so loud that apparently my server had to come back and ask me three times what I had ordered before she finally got it right. I had the Bufalina pizza, which was good although I have to say I prefer Pizzeria Libretto (for food, service and atmosphere). After reading all the rave reviews, my dining companion and I decided to share the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and we both commented that it tasted almost exactly like a mug cake that you can make at home in 60 seconds. The vibe at Terroni is definitely a little contrived, and service wasn't as warm as I would have liked. Overall, I found the whole experience to be quite average. I really expected a lot more from Terroni, and with all the other great dining options in Toronto, I don't anticipate returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great Italian food....not the best but very good compared to many other establishments. Almost every ingredient is imported, aside from the vegetables and beef. And the chocolate molten cake and tiramisu is divine. *drool*"}
{"text":"Generally, I wouldn't write a review with my dissatisfaction, but Terroni is an exception. 

Terroni is ranked well for its ambience and location within the downtown core, and the food is passable (3/5), however the entire experience (2/5) was tainted with its less than welcoming service (1/5) for our going away lunch for a colleague.

1) The hostess welcomed us with a rude response when asked if they could accommodate our small ask to serve self brought cupcakes at the end of our meals. We understand that you are a business, but to bluntly tell us that we would have to sign a waiver in a stern tone and to charge us $4 EACH for every cupcake we consumed is laughable. Had we not had a reservation and were time pressed, we would have walked immediately. The hostess should have been more respectful and accommodating. 

2) We were denied and provided a stuck up response when asked if balsamic vinegar could be brought to the table. Her rebuttal was that the olive oil is of very high quality and should not be tampered with, however at most Italian restaurants this is a staple and we do not understand the strong objection against our simple request. Is this unreasonable? 

3) We were charged 18% gratuity, despite the above 2 points and received generally smaller than average portions. Some colleagues had a $25 lunch pasta that consisted of 5 pieces of vegetarian ravioli with ricotta cheese in it. Not impressed. I understand a 18% tip is customary for large groups, but this really pushed most of us over the edge.

Needless to say, we will no longer be bringing our business, nor clients to Terroni with a less than welcoming Italian service that you would expect with a mid tier restaurant.

At the end of the day, a restaurant is a private venue, however for all the bells and whistles this place makes you jump, you can get much better Italian food an accommodating Italian restaurant elsewhere."}
{"text":"Terroni's newest location on Adelaide is roomy and impressive with a nice modern vibe, much more so than the hot stuffy Queen/Victoria location - as long as you avoid the downstairs dongeon-like dining room.

As with all locations Terroni serves up some good italian food but you need to watch out for what you order. Pizzas and the daily entree specials are consistently exceptional, while pasta dishes have repeatedly let me down."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants ~ this location in particular has a lot of character and it reminds me of Europe. The food is classic and well prepared. However they do not make ANY substitutions- zero! I went there on a date and my partner asked for balsamic vinegar to have with the bread and oil And they wouldn't give us any.. That's just rude! 
I get the concept of not compromising authenticity but that was pushing it! Specially telling us what authenticity is.. In a condescending tone.. But they brain wash the staff - it's not their fault it's a restaurant chain policy ( I think it's  because they're just too cheap personally) 
I've always been mostly vegetarian ethically, but due to health reasons I've had to cut out most dairy in the past few years. This makes it very difficult to eat anything they offer \"as is\" and they won't accommodate a simple request like removing the ricotta from the gnocchi or just having veggies on my pizza. It's unfortunate because I love their  authentic pizza crust and being Italian, I appreciate the food they prepare, but the attitude has to go. 
I don't think I'll be back anytime soon as result - too bad for them - they can't Accommodate a special dietary need = they lose a good customer. All that aside the food quality is consistent and aside from the echoing walls (at this location) you can enjoy some flavorful Italian food in a European style environment! Just as long as you don't have any special requests, this could become one of your favorite restaurants. 
But I'm personally over it!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced Italian with great food, service and ambiance. You absolutely must try the Funghi Assoluti to start (my favourite), Tonnarelli alla Norcina which is pasta with black truffle shavings and homemade spicy sausage or their Sazzizzu panini for lunch (grilled homemade sausage, oyster mushrooms, smoked scamorza) - sit outside on the patio during the summer. I took my guests from NYC here and they absolutely loved the food, service and pricepoint! Definitely one of my go to spots in the city. They also take reservations - amazing."}
{"text":"Tiramisu was amazing . One of the best I've had so far :) seafood pasta also on point !"}
{"text":"Terroni on Price is simply amazing.

The decor is engaging- wooden tables, cozy booths, marble surfaces, and artfully arranged products that the restaurant actually serves along the wall.

The food is simply amazing. I had the \"Santo Stefano\" pizza, which had proscuitto, arugula and mozzarella di bufala. The pizza was generously sized, and the thin crust was delightfully stretchy. The ingredients all stand out delightfully, and were very fresh. You could tell that the menu was carefully crafted, and that the chefs have a profound respect for the food as well as technical competence. No substitutions are allowed, but this doesn't feel like a negative at all.

Service is efficient and attentive, but not overbearing. Split cheques are not allowed.


If the no substitutions policy grates on you- well, there are other Italian restaurants that will give you substitutions- and a free loaf of garlic bread, bottomless soft drinks and an ice cream sundae for kids under 12. 

Overall, Terroni is an experience not to be missed!

PS- Reserve with Open Table. Quick,  accurate, no hassle, and provides planty of options"}
{"text":"Consistently good. Great place for families. Great place for 2 friends too. Love the nizzarda salad for lunch. My kids love their Margherita pizza & Tagliatelle Bolognese. I love their grilled calamari & funghi assoluti & gnocchi. Can get loud."}
{"text":"I really like their food.
I've had a couple of their pizza and pasta, and they were all great!
Waitress was knowledgeable about their menu and their cheese selection (I've had their cheese plate).
And it felt like going through a dungeon to go to the washroom which I kind of enjoyed. :P

My only complaint is that it feels very cramped. I've taken a girl on a date there (the waitress was pretty accommodating that time in terms of her waiting and payment), but it's not somewhere where you can relax too much because it's a generally busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Bar Centrale Di Terroni

Our first stop for a day of food and adventure! At first I thought cool, we are going to a BAR to start our day with a drink. But really we are here for the Breakfast and at 10 AM alcoholic drinks are not served till later...

Love the casual vibe and the set up of the room with the huge windows! On a sunny morning, it is like a solarium and I am getting a sun tan while enjoying my breakfast!

We shared:

Pandolci ($9) - Pancakes, Scandinavian Style with Jam and Nutella
- These little fried dough of joy! Cute for my photos and quite delicious as they are steaming hot!
- It is not the best one I had but for Toronto it is definitely a rare find!
- The kids would love eating those and I feel like bouncing and rolling them around my plate!

Pancetta e Fagioli (13) - Braised Pork Belly, Poached Egg, Navy Beans with a Balsamic Reduction
- Sadly the poached egg is the best part of this dish! The egg was poached perfectly and I can tell it is a great egg from the taste and colour of the running yolk
- Both the pork belly and beans tasted really bland... 

I love my freshly made Americano but I found the Cappuccino a little too mellow for my taste.

Services here are friendly and excellent! 

Bar Centrale Di Terroni is a nice place to have a casual meal and a drink. I definitely will be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Very nice place to have pizza or pasta I order to go pizza it was great and only 1 thing they forgot to cut the pizza so I end up eating a whole thing at once !!!!"}
{"text":"The experience at Terroni was very wonderful overall. Our server was great! He was quite personable, attentive & very knowledgeable regarding the menu. My friends and I began with a cheese platter that was really delicious and our server helped us pair our choices with a great wine. My friends chose pasta dishes that were really outstanding (and I couldn't stop sneaking bites from each of them!) and I got a pizza. The pizza was really delicious complete with sundries tomatoes and arugula. The crust was sooo crispy. I would say this was my favorite dish on my trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"This Terroni location on Queen Street serves better Italian food than all the restaurants in Little Italy combined.

Yeah, I'm willing to say that. Terroni knows what they're doing -- they've opened a couple locations here in Toronto and one in LA, and all the ones here are out-the-door busy, so they must be doing something right. Everything on their menu is authentic Italian, and authentically delicious. All their pasta is made from scratch, in-house, their sausages are home-made by relatives of the owners, and their ingredients are either fresh and local or fresh and right off the plane from Italy. 

And if you're doubting their Italian-ness...get over it. Both founders of Terroni are from the same region of Italy as my family (Foggia/Bari area), and I've had food there enough times to know that it's authentic and amazing.

I've had a couple nights when all I've wanted was some Terroni loving to remind me of all the meals my family cooks in Italy, but the line-up deterred me and I had to go somewhere else for inferior food. Not again. Next time, I shall wait.

And in my opinion, you should wait too. Everyone should go to Terroni at least once (or a million times) but you should definitely take my 5 tips into consideration: 

1) Arrive early! There are no reservations. I know, it's sad. But just show up early, especially if you have a big group. Groups of two tend to move through the line more quickly.

2) Order wine with your meal. Terroni has a booklet of wine choices, and a handful of Italian reds that they carry exclusively. So take advantage of the selection and order some wine. Even their house wine is delicious.

3) Don't cheap out on your meal. Honestly, to have the best experience here you should get at least an appetizer. I'd suggest one of their amazing salads with your meal, preferably some mozzarella di bufala, buffalo mozzarella straight from Italy. And do not share a pizza between two people as a meal for you both -- you will regret this after your first bite.

4) Tip your servers well because they are awesome. I have never had a problem with the service here, everyone is friendly and nice, the food comes fast, and the bill comes exactly when you're thinking about it (or when you ask for it).

5) Tell all your friends you ate real Italian food at the best Italian restaurant in Toronto (and LA). Because you definitely just did."}
{"text":"Meh...didn't live up to the hype.  Overall, It was under-seasoned and lacking much interest.  I wouldn't go back.  
Nice wine list and nice ambience though..."}
{"text":"I've been to the Terroni on Queen West before and have enjoyed it. I can't say the same for the Adelaide location.

The space is beautiful but weirdly configured. Seating is cramped for no reason considering how big the building is. I don't mind being close to tables next to me, but having the back of my chair bumped by waitstaff every time they walked by was irritating. And why is there a DJ playing house music?

Food is pretty good. Fried calamari was better than others give credit for but cried out for some kind of sauce to cut the oil/flour. I also had the Smendozzata pizza, with gorgonzola, red onions and sausage. Can't really go wrong with that.

Service was horrible and ruined what would've otherwise been a fine but forgettable dinner. Our waiter was uninterested and aloof the whole time. Nobody checked on us after our main courses were brought to the table, so we had to go without water or another glass of wine (meaning the waiter lost out on the tip two ways: a lower subtotal and a lower % tip for the crappy effort). We hurried out after less than an hour; it was just a miserable place to stick around."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Went there to order pasta, but as soon as I smelled chocolate,  the terrific bartender, Mitch, informed me that was a homemade chocolate lava cake. Thus, a great arugula salad was my entre leaving room for the most amazing chocolate lava cake I have ever had.  Then I went on a tour of the biluilding. A must for anyone in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so after my first visit here, I was kind of left feeling a little bewildered as to why this restaurant gets so many rave reviews. It was by no means bad, but I didn't find anything remarkable about my food. After returning for a second time and trying a few other things, I kind of get it. I came with two friends on Friday and this time was seated in the room on the lower floor. This room is definitely more intimate and quieter than the main dining room, although less interesting to look at. To start, we ordered the fried calamari, which was actually really, really good. It was just lightly breaded, so it wasn't like the dough overwhelmed the taste of the squid. And I'm so glad it didn't, because the squid was fantastic! It tasted really fresh, and then the texture of it was just perfect - chewy and tender, but still quite soft and moist. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice on it, and it is just amazing. For my main, I tried the seafood spaghetti which everyone raves about. I kind of wish it came with a different kind of pasta, because spaghetti just seems so basic. That being said, it was a good pasta - the texture of the pasta was great, and once again, the seafood, which included clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, and calamari was very fresh, sizeable (the shrimp were huge), and plentiful. I honestly can't get over the texture of their calamari in general, it's just so good. I will say that I thought the portion was a little bit on the smaller side for dinner though. I also sampled a bit of my friends' dishes. One got the pappardelle del iosa which comes with spicy sausage. One bite wasn't too spicy, but I think it would build up. I thought this was okay. My other friend ordered off the special menu for the day, and got pappardelle made with spinach (so the noodles were green) and which came with duck confit. I liked this one better, because I found the duck to be more flavourful than the sausage, although a bit on the salty side. Also the noodles were a bit firmer in this dish.

For dessert, we split some kind of sponge cake thing which had limoncello and mascarpone. I quite enjoyed this, because it was very light and fluffy, not too sweet, and had quite a delicious zesty flavour. It was actually the perfect dessert for me and I would recommend.

The takeaway from this is that Terroni knows how to do seafood right. Get the calamari and the seafood pasta, and you'll be impressed. I'm still a little iffy on some of their other dishes, but at least now I have a few solid tried-and-true favourites at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't think of one bad thing to say about Terroni.  The wine is good, the food is good,  everything is good when you're at Terroni. The service has always been impeccable. Big fan, keep it up ! It can get pretty busy, when it does I would recommend the downstairs area. It is very nice."}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing. I really enjoyed the mushroom and sausage pasta I had (can't remember what it was called but it was yum!). The few things that really ticked me off last time I went with my family for a birthday dinner were: 1) no substitutions 2) no chicken and 3) the server was very judgy by some of our questions. Oh and try asking for parmigiana... We got refused.  I would go their again but only with someone who's adventurous and a foodie at heart. Still annoyed, in no rush to return."}
{"text":"A group of 9 of us went for an 9pm reservation on Nov. 24, 2012. Our table wasn't ready until about 9:15pm. The decor and ambiance are fantastic but the sickly sweet smell that assailed my nostrils when we walked in (I'm assuming some kind of stinky cheese) was unpleasant. It wore off after we got to our table. The table was so low I couldn't cross my legs (I'm small). The table top was too thick for my handbag hanger and there was nowhere to hang our coats, so we hung them on the backs of our chairs and they were touching the floor. The table was nice rustic wood but it caught my sweater's sleeve and almost gave me a sliver so it was uncomfortable. Our server was nice but the bill had a mandatory 18% gratuity, which I don't think was earned that night. The food was really good, if a little pricey.  Calamari alla Griglia $15.95 (grilled calamari appetizer, mixed greens) one of the specials was a lamb dish for $25 for 1 chop, 1 t-bone piece (small) and one medium sized sausage. The place is pretty cramped and between the music playing and the talking it is extremely loud."}
{"text":"Great patio up stairs one of the nicest ones I've seen in Toronto. The service was fabulous.  No real complaints on the food the pastas were spot on.  

The only thing that wasn't so great was the cured meats and cheese.  The selection that was served was pretty average.  We got 2 types of cheese and 1 type of prosciutto. But everything else was great will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"A couple of months back, I had a quick dinner at Terroni as I had to attend another engagement after that. Luckily, we arrived prior to the dinner rush and got a table right away. Terroni is a popular Italian restaurant located on the busy strip of Queen St W, Toronto, ON. The dimly lit establishment had an overall warm and cozy ambiance. 

I have read a lot of negative reviews in regards to the service here as some have experienced pretentious attitudes from the servers. I actually didn't experience any of that myself as I thought our server was knowledgeable of the menu, prompt, and friendly enough. He took our orders and then we were served complimentary bread with olive oil. The basket of bread was fresh but since I am not a fan of the bitter taste of olive oil, I forgo dipping in it.

Additionally, one thing that should be noted is Terroni's well-known policy regarding no modifications or substitutions of the food. According to the policy which is clearly stated on their website and menu, \"our menu is filled with regional Italian dishes that have been prepared the same way for generations. So out of respect for Italian gastronomy--and our grandparents--we maintain a no modifications, no substitutions policy.\"

There was going to food at the event that I was attending that night, so I just opted for the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare ($17.95) and a glass of coke ($2.00). The dish was simply presented on a white oval plate giving it a clean presentation look. The Spaghetti in Canna a Mare contained fresh clams and mussels, calamari, scallops, tiger shrimp, and mixed with a light tomato sauce. The spaghetti dish was executed nicely as the noodles weren't overcooked and the light sauce helped to enhance the flavor of the seafood.

Surely, I will be back another time to try out more items on the menu. My overall experience at Terroni was pretty good. They do offer an extensive menu of different pasta and pizza dishes so there's a good selection here."}
{"text":"I had my dinner date with my hubby on a Thursday evening, the place was packed! Our waiter (Dave) was rushing us since the moment we sat down till we finished our dessert ( not very impressed by this). We had Margherita pizza, couple of non-meat spaghetti dishes and dessert. Our waiter recommended a sweet wine ( which I love), but when he brought it for us he kept saying \" liquorice\", which of course we didn't order! Initially, our waiter seemed offended that we didn't understand what he was saying and after clarification he kept the sweet wine ( not really liquorice). 

My hubby order one of the dessert, which was tasty but as he kept chewing he noticed a \"cardboard\" feeling and he started to take it out. He showed this to the waiter and his response was we make our own dessert and that is shaved chocolate ( as if one doesn't know what shaved chocolate would taste like, really???). Of course, he was rushing us to pay and leave. Guess what-- no tip for you Mister!!! And of course we are not returning for a ridiculous service like this!"}
{"text":"Good, not great, overpriced, vaguely authentic. Also, current yelp ratings for Terroni are overrated!

Overall: ok.

We had penne arrabiata, capricciosa pizza, buffalo cheese ravioli, spaghetti al limone, and a margherita pizza. The fundamental flavors were there, the ingredients were right, the portions small by North American standards but just right by Italian standards, but the overall experience of the food was not as amazing as many of these other reviews would lead you to believe. 

There was a certain sogginess to the pizza, a bit short of that amazing crunchiness that you probably crave. For all of you who think this is the best pizza, PLEASE GO TO ITALY. (Or failing that, try NYC, SF, or other cities with a large expat Italian population.)

The pasta was good. Nothing to write home about.

The service was good, the place crowded and loud, and the atmosphere was upscale but not pretentious.

The price tag was middling, about $20 / person excluding wine."}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinners.
Would definitely come back again.

Pros
- excellent food: definitely better than average, and borderlining fantastic. 
- great ambiance: as mentioned by a previous reviewer, this location is quite \"beautiful\" as it is a renovated courthouse (take beautiful into context though; I'm not talking cathedral here, but it's a nice casual restaurant that's better than a typical Moxie's). The lighting is low (which is good), the bar at the front is nice and the dining rooms are quaint. 
- regular priced food; nothing too expensive, nothing too cheap
- service: normal & good; but sometimes forgetful (hipster-esque as well)

Cons
- it can be really loud @ Terroni's, I find. I dined once in the regular dining area (about 12 of us, so long table) & also downstairs in the cantina and both times, I found it unusually loud. I know this is a weird 'con', and I wouldn't have mentioned it unless I found it unreasonably loud - it made conversation a bit difficult, and something to consider if you're bringing someone here for a first date or something similar
- service can be a bit forgetful sometimes: you ask for one thing, and you may have to ask again.
 
Food recommendations: 
- their pizzas (esp. the classic margherita which is just mozzarella, sauce & basil) are excellent
- pastas are freshly made on site (or so they claim) and is delicious as well

Overall:
Great place to go; they do take reservations at this location for evening (not at the Queen St location) - 6:30pm and 8:30pm, so best to make reservations as they get busy."}
{"text":"This pretentious restaurant refuses to serve balsamic vinegar. On the other hand, their pepperoncini is great and is probably the only highlight of this restaurant."}
{"text":"When food, service, and ambiance come together, it's a magical thing.  That's how it was for us on a Sunday evening at the Terroni on Adelaide St.  Situated in a beautiful quirky historic building (a former courthouse complete with basement jail cells now used as a wine cellar and restrooms), Terroni offers exquisite and authentic dishes from the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo region.  This is not your typical veal parm and spaghetti-with-meatball place. This is fine Italian dining.  We started with a  mezzo plate of salumiere and formaggi and terrific ricotta-stuffed fried zucchini blossoms (light as clouds and succulent within). For primi we shared 2 pastas: tortelloni with ricotta, pecorino and spinach (light interior, al dente skin) and a great tonnarrelli with shaved black truffles (redolent with earthy musky flavors) and homemade sausage - surprisingly light and at the same time, decadent.  Secondi were Tuscan grilled beefsteak (flavorful charred exterior, juicy medium rare interior) and excellent grilled tiger shrimp with grilled vegetables (charred oyster mushrooms, zukes and eggplant) - wonderfully aromatic). For dolci, we had a fantastically rich chocolate torta and decent gelato (lemon and chocolate) -- but we should really have doubled down on the torta ... it was too good to share!  Excellent attentive service, although the wait staff is dressed somewhat informally and sometimes hard to distinguish from casual customers.  Recommend weeknight or Sundays as the place is quieter and less boisterous. Fri/Sat can be loud, crowded, and noisy with dj's house music blaring, making it hard to concentrate on conversation and the food.."}
{"text":"Was there with a large group and booked out the basement; the atmosphere was inexplicably italian (as far as I know; still haven't been to Italy). 

We started off with cocktails and possibly the best variety of bruschetta I've ever had. The first course consisted of a fairly average salad, and platters of authentic cheese and meats. We then moved onto the main course; we were served platters and dishes of various pastas, all of which were generally very good but not exciting."}
{"text":"Quick update from the sweltering heat of downtown Toronto:

1. the roof patio at Terroni looks to be almost ready for business (and related shenanigans)

2. last night proved, once and for all: Italian cocktails go a long way to cooling one down in the summer weather.  To whet your whistle: amaretto and limonata over ice; gin and grapefruit and rosemary; white wine spritzers.

Love it here."}
{"text":"Delicious pastas and pizzas. Beautiful patio in the back with plants and trees! Perfect hang out spot with family and friends"}
{"text":"Ok so by now we all know that Terroni is a great spot for a delicious pasta/pizza dinner. With three beautiful locations in Toronto and an outpost in LA, their obviously doing something right. Recently though I was reminded how lovely it is for a casual mid-afternoon light lunch. Especially because hello the patio is one of those beautiful sprawling Queen West secrets that you smack yourself in the forehead for forgetting about as soon as you see it. This patio is probably as big as in the interior and has the same comfortable vibe as the main restaurant, only airier. I like this vibe because you can go ahead and get dressed up for a nice meal, or walk in off the street in jeans and a t-shirt, and feel at home either way. 

My friend and I were having a meandering Queen West Sunday and opted for the latter option. She was having a major craving for the pasta alla norma (riagatoni with tomato sauce and eggplant) and I was having a major craving for a glass of rosé and some sort of greens. In the end, we were both completely satisfied.  I opted for one of the salad specials, which I can't for the life of me remember the name of. I remember it was $14, had lots of multi-coloured beets, arugula, pumpkin seeds, salted ricotta, and came served on a well seasoned chickpea pancake. And I remember really liking it."}
{"text":"This review is in regards to the Queen St Location.

Atmosphere: I love the overall design and feel of the restaurant. I found it to be cozy, rustic with modern touches. We asked for a table on the patio and we were seated within 10 minutes. I fell in love with the layout and the added touches such as the string lights. I felt as though I was at a friend's house for a get together. 

Service: Our server was knowledgeable, friendly but too laid back. I don't think any customer should go without refills (especially when their meals arrive) Not something you want to ask for.  However when she did come around, the refills or what we needed was quickly received.

Food: My friend and I decided to split a pasta and a pizza. We got the gnocchi alla simi. Presentation was neat, simple and appealing but seasoning was lacking. I found it to be very bland. We got the Li Pecuri pizza which sounded delicious (was delicious) but the pizza itself was soggy. Nothing more horrifying than soggy pizza. For dessert we decided to try I believe some sort of chocolate lava cake with filling.There was also some custard filling on the outside to dip the cake in. I am not sure of the name but it was wonderful. The best part of the meal.

I may go back and try them out again."}
{"text":"An arrogant business model that puts it's own agenda above customer experience or preferences. Steadfastly refusing to provide balsamic for the bread is a small thing, but the manner in which it's done is insulting. Refusing to slice the pizza on the premise that they're giving the customer the opportunity to do it themselves is patently absurd. If that were the case, then they deprived us of the opportunity to fetch the pizza from the kitchen ourselves. This attitude is shared by the staff in general from what we saw and tone of arrogance made it an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends for dinner on a summer night.  Was a beautiful evening out so we sat on the roof, which is pretty big.  Our server was very friendly and good with his recommendations.  Shared two bottles of wine (little overpriced, but to be expected) and I had the lamb chop which was definitely tasty.  Not anything to die for, but overall a good atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Just an okay experience with no major complaints. The building where this restaurant resides is very unique and full of history, as the building was originally an old court house. The owners have kept many of the old jail cells in their original condition and are used for storage, which is neat to see on your way to the bathroom! This particular location is quite large and has many different seating areas. I arrived with my family and we were seated in a back room that was a little more intimate and away from the major seating area. The food itself was just okay, nothing outstanding. They offer a wide variety of homemade pasta. I had Ravioli di Zio Paperone, pasta was cooked nicely, I would have liked it to be a bit more flavourful."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is quite a scene
And service can be in-between,
Terroni makes me wait in line
But damn that pizza's so divine!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the line - this spot is just not worth waiting for.

We came here for the Sunday family meal for years. Then the chef / owner got uppity and instituted a \"no substitution\" policy and really pissed us off. 

How can you not care if your customers are vegetarian? It  was easier to claim allergies than vegetarianism to remove some ham from a pizza. Unbelievable.

The final straw though was the removal of the balsamic vinegar. We always enjoyed dipping our bread in oil and vinegar there - literally for years. Then one day she tells us that we can't have it. That the olive oil is too good to be enjoyed with the balsamic. It was too much, and we stopped going.

Even the staff seemed upset by the changes. Too bad."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Terroni and frequently went there for dinners with my girlfriends. No, the huge line up didn't bother me too much and the fact that the service is shit wasn't a deterrent either. 

However, the last time I went to Terroni I had never been so insulted by a restaurant in my entire life. To start off the waitress was a bitch but that is common there. She refused to tell us exactly what the specials were and wouldn't let anyone alter their dishes claiming it would compromise the integrity of the flavor. MY ASS! The PAYING customer should get what they want, no ifs ands or buts. 

They refused to make me a Panini the way I wanted it because it wasn't exactly on the menu even though they did have all the ingredients and it wasn't rocket science. They refused to take something OFF a pizza for my friend and when it came down to actually eating our meal they refused to give another friend Parmesan cheese on her pasta because it has shellfish in it. 

WHO THE FUCK DO THEY THINK THEY ARE? 

I will never go back to Terroni and I am spreading the word that they are pretentious and rude. Not only have they lost a very loyal customer but from now on they are blacklisted in my books."}
{"text":"Consistently great food! I'm here quite often and I never leave disappointed. Yes, it is a bit expensive, however look where you are. You pay for ambiance, not only food. We had  pizza which was very large, a good value for the $17 I paid for it, as well as the papardelle which was very delicious. 

Drink selection is good as well, the 'make your own' gin and tonic is a nice touch and makes you personalize a drink to what you like. 

My one knock would be that the only meats they serve is what is on special. This is a very carb-heavy restaurant. If they mixed in a meat dish or two on the regular menu, it would be a perfect 5"}
{"text":"Great southern italian cuisine. Sat outside on the picnic tables on a warm Toronto evening. highly recommended, but expect a line."}
{"text":"Good food !!quite impressed actually!
Portion sizes are quite small if guys are hungry but perfect for gals!
The wait was 30 mins for a table, groups of 4 or more expect to wait much longer.
Small space, loud and festive !"}
{"text":"This is a really beautiful spot with three floors and assuming you have the stamina to make it all the way to the roof during a nice Toronto day, it's especially delightful.  The food was top-notch and every dish I sampled deserved a solid 5-stars.  It's the service and attitude that knocks them down significantly.  One in our party was allergic to onions and they refused to eliminate them from any of their dishes or make any substitutions.  The final straw was when my daughter asked for some parmesan cheese for her pizza and they promptly replied that \"it doesn't go with that one.\"  They refused to bring it even though they had it sitting there. Astounding and ridiculous.  Had I not been with relatives, I would have asked them to remove it from the bill and I would have gotten up and walked out.  Any restaurant that places their own chef egos over the dietary needs or preferences of their guests doesn't really belong in the restaurant business (or they deserve to be out of business).  And, when you refuse someone something so simple in an Italian restaurant as parmesan cheese, then you clearly don't deserve repeat business. The kale salad was among the best I've ever had and, normally, would bring me back. Despite the fact that their only other location is close to me in LaLa Land, I don't be paying them any visits nor would I recommend it to any of my culinary commerades.  I can only assume that the holier-than-though attitude permeates throughout and there are a plethora of fine other restaurants who are more than happy to cater to the likes and needs of their guests."}
{"text":"I was so amped to get an invite to come to Terroni for a friends birthday - Instead of leaving happy and satisfied, I left disappointed with a frown on my face. What really ruined the experience for me was the service. Our first server seemed like he was in a rush when he was serving us - Seemed like he was finishing his shift. Why take us then? Why not give us to another server off the bat? The least he could do was update us and let us know that we'd have to wait. We first ordered 3 pizzas as an appetizer. We all devoured it, and had to wait 30mins afterwards for service. During that time nobody came to check up on us nor were our drinks refilled - we were so thirsty!! 

The pizzas we ordered arrived and I have to say for the price tag they place on it I was left feeling underwhelmed. You pay 20$+ for them and they are about the size of a medium pizzas, all arrived burnt and chewy. Toppings were sparingly placed. Honestly I could get a better pizza at pizza hut which is pretty good for a fast food place. 
  
I ordered the Pappardalle Alla Iosa as my main dish. Presentation of the dish was great, but I was underwhelmed with the portion size of the dish. As well, it was good but nothing exceptional. It felt like something I could make at home using store-bought noodles.
 
Our second server who replaced the original server was great and very attentive. Our water glasses were kept filled and she even brought extra chili flakes after noticing that we used it all! She was the saving grace for otherwise a mediocre experience.. Thank you for trying to save the night."}
{"text":"I lived in the Queen West neighbourhood and frequented this restaurant regularly.  The service is inconsistent but I've always liked the food.  At times, the service is great and most of the time it's slow, but I had my worst restaurant experience at this restaurant.  On a cold Friday night, I went to this restaurant with two girlfriends for dinner to catch up.  After appetizers, our meal and some drinks, we continued to chat.  The waitress, who was friendly at first, got annoyed that we had overstayed our welcome.  She sighed and rolled her eyes at us when we ordered hot water.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, delicious food and wine, and excellent service. We tried some gin and tonics (fun selection of both) and shared the carpaccio. I had the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare, which was very good and zesty. My girlfriend had the Ravioli di Zio Paperone, and those were insanely delicious. I unfortunately forgot which wine we got a bottle of, but it was recommended by our waiter and worked very well with both of our meals. Also we let the staff know that we were headed to a show after dinner and everybody was very diligent in making sure we got there on time. Overall I would absolutely recommend this place and will absolutely come back sometime."}
{"text":"We selected Terroni for a Christmas gathering and left feeling a little disappointed.

The space is really unique and actually quite impressive as you walk into what used to be an old courthouse.

The Good:
- The food was excellent, everyone was quite impressed with their meals.
- Our waitress was fun and attentive
- The atmosphere was really nice too, though a little loud.

The Bad:
- The serving size on the ravioli was a little small. I did arrive hungry but after sharing an app, my main still left me quite hungry. 
- The space is quite tight.

The Ugly:
- The other staff members were quite pushy. Numerous times they came to clear our plates even though we were still eating from them. I understand that the holidays are a busy time, but when there is still food on my plate and my fork is taking it to my mouth, I'm still eating. I didn't think this would be a difficult concept.

I don't know if I'll return any time soon, but I don't think they'll miss me. It's definitely a place to check out, but I don't know if enough of the good stood out to outweigh the bad to keep going back."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Came on a Sunday night place wasn't really busy. The hostess first sat us at a bad table so we requested a different area and got a booth which was much better. We ordered the margarita pizza which comes un cut ( idk why) the pizza was ok but nothing to write home about. We also ordered the pappardelle pasta which i thought was too salty, and my friend ordered a seafood pasta which i didn't try. Food came out quickly which is always appreciated. I told the server it was friend's birthday and they brought out a complimentary mini tiramisu which was really nice. for dessert we had the chocolate torte and the tiramisu which were delicious! The food was meh but the dessert was really good."}
{"text":"Terroni is consistently yummy, no matter what it is - pizza, pasta, salads, desserts, appies.  Fresh, perfectly seasoned, just the right textures, and tasty to boot!  They also have a really great selection of unique wines.  Staff are knowledgeable and friendly.  In this particular location, I love the architecture of the old building, very grand.  

However, the one thing though to bear in mind - there is not a lot of baffling in the room so it can be noisy.  You have to yell to hear the person you're at your meal with."}
{"text":"Seeing this place on the \"Top 10 Best Italian\" restaurants in Toronto, I had nothing but high expectations. 

Cool and vibrant place for a casual dinner with friends. Using words as \"ciao\", \"buongiorno\", and \"minchia bro\", will make you sound well traveled.

Nevertheless, if I had to bring Don Corleone to dinner, and my life depended on it, I would reconsider my options."}
{"text":"Yes it's true - they don't take reservations and won't allow ANY substitutions on the menu, but Terroni has to be doing something right because they regularly have a lineup out the door, the kitchen and bar are always bustling with activity, all of the servers look like they're having a GREAT time and I've never had a screwup with my meal in all of the visits I've made. 

The food is excellent and there's a daily changing menu of specials that's printed out on a small menu card with the day's date. Their warm flourless chocolate cake (\"lava cake\") is one of two things I'd request for my \"Last Supper\". It's heavenly. 

The servers are extremely knowledgeable about the menu offerings - they all have impeccable Italian pronunciation (to the point that you're embarrassed to fumble through your order - I prefer pointing to menu items instead), are young and fun and seem to enjoy their jobs. 

The decor is stunning (second only to their Adelaide/former Courthouse location) and seems truly authentic and 'homey'. The bathrooms are also beautiful. It feels like a really cool place to be and it's great for larger groups, if you show up at the right time. I never feel rushed when I'm at Terroni, even when it's extremely busy."}
{"text":"Although I'm Terroni on Queen's #1 fan and it gets an undisputed five star review from me, the Adelaide Street location is really hit or miss, or \"dine at your own risk\". While they may have the same menu, quality food, outstanding presentation and a tremendous decor (this is the former Courthouse bar/lounge), what's really lacking here is consistent service and general organization.

What it's missing is the old world charm and vigor that Terroni on Queen has - the servers there are lively, enthusiastic about the menu and seem to all like one another. Things at Terroni on Adelaide are markedly different - the servers are more aloof, less attentive and hardly personable at all.

The reservation system is flawed - I've gotten so much conflicting information about whether or not they take reservations, WHEN they do (it's only after 7 on certain days I think?) and for how many people that I don't even think the staff themselves know the correct answer. If you arrive after 7:30pm expect to wait a while in the lobby and when you're party is finally called, if it's reallllly busy a hostess will come out with a chalkboard held up over her heard that has your name written on it. 

Try to avoid being seated at certain tables in the basement as it's really easy to be constantly in the way as seating is tight and it's a high traffic zone

If you're looking for the ultimate Terroni experience, head to Terroni on Queen. If you want to wow your guests with beautiful decor, cathedral ceilings and a bustling clientele, head to Terroni on Adelaide. Just don't set your service expectations too high!"}
{"text":"And now, a dramatic reading of a real breakup letter, to a real restaurant. ** 

My Dearest Terroni,

It's been a wonderful 10 years. We've been together much longer than I could expect any relationship to last. I've always taken a Pete Doherty approach to relationships - fuck forever: I tell my friends, if I can have a solid 10 years with one person, that's a great run and more than anyone can ask for these days. So it's been a blast, but regrettably it's time for me say goodbye.

We've certainly had our ups and downs. In fact, it's been quite turbulent. Loyalty is one of my specialties and sticking by you throughout was a true test of this loyalty.

\"But it's so pretentious, the no substitutions policy at Terroni! It's barbaric!\" they'd declare. No matter - I continued to namedrop you when friends sought out birthday and other celebratory dinner venues. I fiercely defended your refusal to allow any changes to your \"the way we intend food to be served\" menu. 

\"But they refuse to take a reservation for my group unless it's for more than 6 people, between 5-6pm, and an odd-numbered day in June with Scorpio rising and Mars in Cancer.\" Just go, I'd say. The wait will be worth it, and you never really have to wait THAT long. 

\"But they're closed on Sundays. What kind of restaurant closes on Sundays?\" That's why there are three locations, I'd say. Make the trek to Yonge and St. Clair and don't worry about it. It'll be worth it. 

\"But they refuse to cut my pizza into slices!\" OK, you've got me there. But isn't the pizza great?

I could only afford to visit your locations 3-4 times a month, but I was loyal to you for nearly ten years. Your reign as top dog in my restaurant black book ended last night at approximately 8:33pm ET.

We called you on Friday to inquire about a reservation for fifteen people on a Sunday. You told us you didn't take reservations, but to call ahead and you'd start preparing our table. \"It'll be fine,\" you lied. \"Just come on in.\"

6:55pm ET: Your hostess took our names down and my friend, who was celebrating his 30th birthday that day and had impressively coerced his \"I don't go north of Bloor\" collection of friends into gathering at Yonge and St. Clair, told us the wait wouldn't be long, but looked visibly anxious. 

7:35pm ET: Your manager told us \"It won't be long now - there's a large party that's already paid and we're just waiting for them to leave. Should be any moment now - no more than five minutes.\" This was the last update we received as we all stood crowding the front entrance and watched table after table have their name called.

8:00pm ET: At this point everyone was antsy, having fasted for the entire day in anticipation of our celebratory feast. A few of us ordered coffees at the bar and the server told us, \"We're preparing a sweet table for you.\" A few people asked for an update, and the hostess/manager told us that she wouldn't ask the large party to hurry or leave - fine. We asked her to entice them with a round of drinks on us - perhaps they could move their party to the bar? She refused. 

8:33pm ET: I hovered and seethed. How was it that nearly an hour had passed since the \"we should be seating you within 5 minutes\" update, with not so much as an apology, an appeasement or even an amendment to the original promise. So nearly 90 minutes of waiting in total. My issue wasn't with the length of time waited (we knew we'd have to wait) but the way we were treated.

Then there was a small altercation with the hostess/manager that I shan't repeat because it made me so angry. Let's just say it involved some interference by famished and flustered patrons, the utterance of \"Don't talk to my customers. That's my job.\" and further ignoring.

It's that sort of \"fuck you\" attitude that I don't appreciate, and finally led our group to pick up and take our business elsewhere. I should have heeded the telling sign that only three reviews had been written on this location in all of 2009, and none of them positive.

Never again, Terroni. 

I have a new Italian boyfriend now and he'll happily prep southern-style, home cooked food for me to my preferences. It'll be at a fraction of the inflated cost without an extra helping of pretension and gestapo-like enforcement. He'll let me dip my bread in olive oil AND balsamic vinegar if I want to, goddammit, he'll put parmagiano reggiano on any dish I want, not just the ones that the chef thinks should have it, AND he'll cut my pizza into fucking slices.

With love and fondness,
Kat F.

{"text":"Terroni is a well known Italian restaurant in Toronto. I went here for my birthday and the food was perfect for my family and some of them are really picky..  Lol 
They had a great pairings of wine with each of meals. Dessert was great. So worth it"}
{"text":"Great vibe on all three levels.A bit of a kindergarten from 5-7, then gets hipster/  Rosedale crowd onwards with music turned up to match the crowd.Honestly speaking food is good,not great.Everything seemed to need a bit more seasoning.Pasta el dente but bland.Ate their twice in 5 days and would only go back for the scene,not so much for a great bite."}
{"text":"Came during lunch. Not at all busy and great service. Food was great!

Had a taste of what looked like ravioli with duck.. holy! that is god-taste! yum. Ate the panini with salmon.. also good but not god-taste!

Gotta get that duck next time! duck duck duck..."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! We got one pizza for 2 people and we're both very satisfied. The staff was very attentive and there was plenty of space between us and the other guests. We were walking down Queen st looking for something/anything that was opened and this was a great surprise! I'd definitely go back !"}
{"text":"I do not usually do Italian food, but when I do , I do it big!
I saw all the discouraging review against this place but too be honest, if you want decent Italian food, this is where you belong to.
Food: I had Funghi Assoluti? Ravioli di Zio Paperone? Ravioli di pork sausage. The waitress was like, Funghi Assoluti is really good. Although I was not in a mood of salad, I still went for it. And this dish did not disappoint me at all. In fact, it is one of the best salad I had so far in all the Italian place I have ever visited. The mush is sauteing well and the angula balanced with its freshness making the dish not greasy at all but gave me a feeling of lightness. Ravioli di Zio Paperone? Ravioli di pork sausage are so-called Italian dumplings. Zio Paperone is made by spinach dough and duck confit into it. Very tasty. I did not try the sauce and the mushroom, but looks like it's balanced. In addition, Spicy Pork Ravioli is delicious too. Very enlighten my tasty. 
I am very thankful for our waiter to bring us not only bread but also hot pepper sauce to me. The hot pepper sauce actually made the bread taste so much better.

Service: we were there around 3pm. Not a lot of people here. Our waitress came here quick to place our orders. I want to thank her so much to provide me such delicious salad dish choices. I also want to thank her to be so nice and treat us so kindly and well. And I appreciate the little talk between us making me more feel at home. 

Price: I do not care price if I am having a really good meal. But if you wanna know, the Ravioli di Zio Paperone? Ravioli di pork are 20 +.  My Funghi Assoluti is 14+. 

Overall: I did not know that this place is like a chain resturant but they do have other similar restaurant in other areas. I think i will definitely visit next time when I am in LA! While I am writing the review, I am little bit jealous of the fact that Toronto people have such great opportunities to eat here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 3.5.

I like so many things about the physical location itself. The exterior has so much character (being an old courthouse.) The main dining room inside is sunken and has high ceilings so it's very airy and spacious. The patio tucked away in the back is quiet and has plenty of shade. (I never understand the concept of eating on patios that are street side where I breathe in car exhaust and pedestrians can stare at me and/or my food.)

Like its sister restaurant La Bettola di Terroni, they have those tiny bottles of peach nectar which I like, and the deep-fried calamari which I love. But like at its sister restaurant, I could take or leave their pasta entree (in this case the spaghetti al limone.)"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant around. Great energy and food. Yeah they still don't slice your pizza... But Im over that. I like it for clients or family. It's always a good meal."}
{"text":"Great location, great decor, massive space to accommodate a lot of people, sometimes they spin music too! And that's it - this place is more of an experience, a place to host parties, grab drinks and whatnot than it is for their food.

A quite lengthy menu with a lot of options but it just isn't that authentic. I mean, the food tastes ok, some of them might even taste great, but these aren't the tastes that will bring your taste buds to Italy if that's what you're looking for.

I've tried their seafood spaghetti one weekend and the taste was nothing special, the seafood wasn't exceptionally fresh either. Recently, I've also tried their Santa Stefano pizza which came with bufala mozzarella, 2 slices of prosciutto, and way too much arugala. I really wanted this pizza for the bufala but it was so disappointing. The crust of their pizza was done well though but if you're a bufala lover, this place is not for you!

Overpriced and underwhelming, I'd only come back if someone hosted a party here. Otherwise, lots of other Italian places to go to for better value and better food."}
{"text":"I am not generally a huge fan of Italian but I really like Terroni.  Their pasta is homemade with sauces that will have you clearing the place with bread.  The atmosphere is trendy and can be a bit loud.  I would say it is a better spot to go with friends than a date.  That said, the space is well appointed and feels warm.  There is a second floor but it doesn't feel disconnected at all from the restaurant.  In fact, I preferred it as it was more intimate."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, staff is very friendly and the pizza rocks! I can only recommend it."}
{"text":"Great trendy restaurant near Toronto's laid back Trinity Bellwoods Park. No reservations, and I waited about 20 minutes for a table. We got ourselves a beautiful spot on the patio. The food was good, nothing spectacular. The service however could have been better... the waiter never offered to refill our glasses, the food was warm -- it had definitely been sitting around the kitchen. After we were seated, we waited for 10 minutes before anyone brought us a menu. 

I love the outside barbecue.  Walking to the patio, I passed a chef who was cutting, chopping, marinating, and sizzling all before my eyes. Breathtaking -- especially after waiting 20 minutes!

When we left, there was still a long line which ended on Queen st. It's hard to find good Italian food in Toronto. 

If you're looking to try Italian cuisine or are a huge fan, this is definitely a restaurant you should visit."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service I've ever experienced. I was absolutely blown away by how arrogant they are, and how little they care about their patrons. To top it all off, they charged our party an 18% automatic gratuity. While this is common for large parties, it certainly stings when accompanied by such poor service. It just felt like an insult that topped off an already miserable experience. 
In case anyone wants details, it went a little like this. Everyone orders without incident, and some time later they bring out bread and olive oil for dipping. I politely ask if they could bring balsamic vinegar, and the server refuses. Not a \"we don't have it\", but a \"no, you can't have any\". I said that I can just pay extra if they charge for it, but no, it was a \"I will tell you what you can and can't eat here, what you want doesn't matter one bit\".
Finally, food comes out, but two people are missing their orders. They figure, whatever, it's a bit delayed, so they wait a bit more. Finally, they ask about it, and the guy that seemed like a manager tells us that they don't have those dishes available, and for some reason no one could be bothered to tell us this and we were just supposed to discover it on our own when we received no food. They picked new dishes, and got them around the time that everyone else had finished eating. No apologies were offered about any of this. 

Not only would I never consider coming back here, but I will tell everyone I know how bad it is for as long as I can remember to do so."}
{"text":"One of my worst food experiences in Toronto. 1- There are way too many tables for the space 
2-the place is really really dim (it was hard reading the menu
3- The food portions are really small, I have had tapas that are larger 
4- My pasta took over 45 min to get to the table and it was undercooked 
5-  The sea food pasta had almost no sea food in it (1 shrimp, 2 tiny pieces for scallops, and 5 rings of calamari and 6 mussels)
6- The sea food was overcooked and chewy (with the exception to the one shrimp that was actually the only good thing in my place )
7-The place is overpriced"}
{"text":"As a Rosedale resident I know Terroni well and I applaud their culinary creations and restaurant design. I have no doubt that their rooftop deck will become a Toronto institution.
BUT this review is about Bar Centrale Di Terroni downstairs at street level. Last night was my first drop in here and only because upstairs was hopping busy on a Thursday night a 9pm. What a happy detour!
Thoroughly enjoyed the service. Our fedora topped and plaid-shirted waiter expertly helped us with our the wine choices and recommended some of the menu items. He cleverly got our food order started so we had food arriving at the table in a timely fashion. Perfect for a tapas style 9pm dinner. 
Highly recommend the fritto misto, lightly battered calimari and shrimp, presented in a rolled paper cone. Lovely presentation and delicious!"}
{"text":"I especially like this location given the fantastic vibe, the food has always been a notch above mediocre. Definitely, go with the pasta's rather than the pizzas.Go for the vibe, not the food

But, I think this establishment has serious fundamental hospitality problems. First of all, substitution in any way is strictly prohibited in Terroni, so if there is an ingredient that you don't like in your pizza, tough luck...

So, I went for the pizza( of course no substitution allowed) and asked the waiter to cut my pizza into 4. I was told that traditionally in Italy they do not cut the pizza in a restaurant. It was a good thing that the restaurant was in Toronto. So, I asked him to untraditionally cut the pizza. Not only I was told that he cant do that, He asked me if it would be challenging for me use the fork and knife myself to cut it.

I find this restaurant to be lacking the fundamental values of hospitality. Not only the waiter did not accommodate my request, he was impolite enough to make such a rude remark. At the end of the day, I am a guest in that restaurant and this is no way for a host to treat a guest"}
{"text":"This is my 5th time at Terroni Adelaide and it's one of my favourite Italian Toronto restaurants for occasions, casual dining, dates, and birthdays! I've celebrated all of those at Terroni over the past 2-3 years, and I haven't been let down yet. If you're looking for a date spot with great wines and fresh pasta for a reasonable price, this is your spot. ALWAYS make a reservation in advance, otherwise you'll be waiting 1-2 hours minimum on a busy night. It's always packed. I'll give a summary for the restaurant, menu, what to expect, pros/cons, and tips!

Pros: Romantic atmosphere and interior with candle light tables and dim lighting (but you can still read the menu), *daily* specials for apps and main dishes, all pasta is made fresh in-house, great recommendations for wine and dish pairings from servers, live DJ on weekend nights, great consistent service especially for occasions, delicious and filling apps + main + desserts with medium sized portions, enough to fill you up. Reasonably priced per dish (about $12-$25). Huge menu with lots and lots of options from Italian apps, to pizza, pasta, salads, panini's, desserts, teas, coffees--likely something for everyone.

Cons: Drink prices are somewhat steep, while some cocktails and wines are more reasonable. Al dente pasta tasted a bit more raw than al dente should taste. Some dishes just didn't taste good at all (the eggplant appetizer, and duck confit pasta + pesto gnocchi pasta and it was 2/5 stars, we had to send one of the pasta's back, but management was great about redeeming the situation and switched it out for any pasta of our choice, free of charge).

Atmosphere: It's in a old courthouse with 3 levels, a large main entrance with a fully stocked bar and a large list of wines. Fun tip: their menu wine list changes weekly! You can always hang out here while you wait for a table. Interior is beautiful with dim lighting and lots of accent lights to warm it up. Definitely a warm space. Lots of small tables and booths. Good for groups. BUT, the tables are quite close together (you can always hear everyone's conversation and need room to move from your table) and I don't think it would be suitable for kids or have adequate room for high chairs.

Menu: Lots of great options for everyone, with some unique twists on Italian food. Dishes are written in Italian and described in English, and servers are great about offering recommendations based on what you like and don't like. Drinks are pricey and you don't get as much as you're paying for, but usually I've had 1-2 drinks at most. Pasta's are worth it, they are fresh and filling with decent small-medium sized portions. The pizza's are okay, a plate size version and not worth the $15-20 in my opinion. Usually for a group of 2-5 people, we get: 1-2 apps, 2-4 pasta dishes, 1-2 pizza dishes, 2-3 drinks, and 1-3 desserts--which we usually all share. But they are all individually portioned. For birthdays, I've received a complimentary Nutella croissant with a candle, and complimentary Tiramisu in the past few recent years. 

A++ recommended dishes that I eat every time I go and tried multiple times and loved them each time: 
Appetizers - Burrata with basil, tomatoes, and crostini, calamari grilled or fried, and octopus. 
Pastas - Spaghetti in Canna a Mare, Tortelloni di Ricotta, Ravioli di Zucca. Dessert - Tiramisu and the Nutella croissant! 

Summary: Go here for great Italian pasta, apps, and dessert. Bring a date, your parents, a friend, a group of friends, it suits all kinds of groups. Reasonably priced. You can dress up or be casual, on a weekend, or after work. Maybe not suitable for kids. Try it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yes, the no substitutions thing is frustrating but the food and atmosphere are both really great!  We had the Polentona pizza and it was amazing! I ordered the verde salad to start and thought it was just okay- really bland blend of lettuces. The rigatoni arcobaleno tasted really fresh and bright, lots of flavour. Although the table next to me ordered this as well and the presentation was a lot nicer, mine looked like it was put together in a rush. The spaghetti al Limone was delicious. They also had a feature salad with grilled shrimp and it was incredible- although to call it a \"salad\" is a stretch, there weren't really any vegetables in it! 
I always love the pizza and pasta at any Terroni location I go to though, you can't lose, it's always going to taste great."}
{"text":"I write this review more for the customer service than for the food.  Since they would not take a reservation over the phone, our party of 6 arrived at 6:30 on a Friday evening hoping it was early enough to not have to wait very long for a table.  We were immediately told we were the \"2nd party of six waiting\". Off we went to the bar upstairs having given our cell number to the hostess so she could text us when our table became available.

One hour and twenty minutes later, we still had no table!  Worse yet, no one cared.  Several hosts and hostesses with ear phones were running around the restaurant like chickens without heads.  After several requests, we were told there were no tables of six available!  So odd to be told that since directly in front of the bar was an empty table of two right next to an empty table of four!!!  When we drew the hostesses attention to these two tables asking that they be put together to accommodate our party of six, she adamantly told us they were for reservations!

I get people have reservations, but...why tell us an hour and twenty minutes prior that we are the second table of six waiting?  Why not just be up front and tell us we have a ridiculously long wait ahead of us so we can decide if we actually want to stay?

We wouldn't take no for an answer and the hostess finally seated us in the combined table for 2 and 4.

The food?  It was fine but that is not the point of this review.  Terroni needs to step it up and be transparent when guests arrive hoping for a table.  Be honest and tell us how long the wait is. Then let me decide if I want to wait...don't make me wait an unheard amount of time and then continually ignore me when I ask how much longer the wait is."}
{"text":"I had to try this place out -- what all the hype was about. I always walk past this place and it is packed! 

Went to eat one night and had a fairly good experience. Although the food is extremely overpriced -- it was still tasty and delicious. I had the gnocchi and it was great. 

I would go to this place again -- maybe with a little bit more money in my pockets."}
{"text":"Honestly was super pumped to come try their truffle pasta with spicy sausage as I have been following their Instagram for sometime. Came on a weekend when it was pretty nice out and went to the patio at the back and that was super nice. The service was also very good. However, the biggest disappointment was the dish. The first five bites was amazing but then the saltiness kicked it and the rest of the dish was waaaay too salty for me and drinking a lot of water at the end didn't help much and I could taste the salt many hours after. Perhaps it was my high expectations that made me so disappointed so try for yourself and other dishes to see if you like it. Oh but I got the profiteroles as desserts to go and they were AMAZING. There are too many restaurants in Toronto to still try to go back for me though...unless I got back for dessert."}
{"text":"I go here for a thin crust pizza. That's about it.  

I'm sure the other stuff is of decent quality. Looks as if it is, but why fix something that isn't broken"}
{"text":"This location is so different than the court house Terroni in the east end. I think I prefer the fast-paced and casual atmosphere at this one, but once in a while it is nice to eat in a jail cell. For fun.

I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm a carnivore, but the Spaghetti Limone is the tastiest thing on Queen W. It is so fresh, with lemons, spinach, capers*, red onions and heaps of parm chunks. 

The wine is a bit over-priced, but, well, who cares. When having pasta, one must have wine, so they've kind of got you cornered.

PEPPER POINTS: For their stylish magazine. 

*Capers can do no wrong."}
{"text":"This evening was my first time at this Terroni location. 

It is housed in a huge old courthouse and is perhaps one of the most stunning restaurants in the city. The skeleton of the courthouse remains, and it is marvelously decorated with old Italian signs, big wood tables and artsy new light fixtures. If I win the lottery I want whoever did their interior design to come to my (hypothetical) house. 

The menu is quite extensive, and there are many specials every evening. Tonight I had one of their pasta specials, which was a fettuccine with prosciutto with parm and mint. Mint? Yes... and it was delicious. I also stole bites of my date's fig and Gorgonzola pizza. I preferred the pasta, but the pizza was nothing to sneeze at. 

This is a perfect place to bring visiting family/friends when you want to splurge, as it's a bit pricey. I was here with friends from the UK and funnily enough they pointed out that it's one of the featured picks in the Lonely Planet Canada book. The book has a polar bear on the cover, which is completely unrelated but deeply amused me.  

FUN FACT: Terroni is the term for people from southern Italy, to the south or \"from the earth\". Thanks Google!"}
{"text":"This was a massive disappointment and a waist of time. I've never ever heard of a resultant with the most ignorant rules. We asked for balsamic for the bread and they said that we do not give the customers balsamic because it ruins the taste( the balsamic was for the flavourless bread). The manager came over  because the waiter could not even understand why they have these rules. My advice is if you go to this restaurant is to bring your own pizza cutter (there an Italian restaurant that specializes in pizza and they don't have one or cut the pizza for u) and balsamic and diet soda (the owner doesn't \"believe in diet stuff\". The cup was also dirty and I asked for a straw and they said there straw-less. And if u think it's your food and you have the right to choose if u want to take off something in the dish YOUR WRONG because they don't change the dish NO EXCEPTIONS not even if you are allergic to the ingredient."}
{"text":"Food is really good, simple Italian food, very tasty.   Wait staff very good,  a bit on the slow side.   Reasonably priced as well.  I've been there a few times, haven't been disappointed yet !! Aside from the wait staff being a little slow, everything else was great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere tends to get crowded. Food is excellent but pricey. Service staffs are great. but the restaurant itself is quite pretentious.  No substitutes for anything on the menu. Very reluctant to make any changes. Pasta is great everything made fresh in house.  Pizza is good and seafood also."}
{"text":"We randomly picked this place off a list of \"places to eat\" in Toronto. On our first attempt we weren't able to make a reservation, only to find out that it was because the Cast of \"Argo\" booked the place for an after party (we were there during the Toronto Film Festival). Awesome!

We made it there the next day and ordered Gnocchi alla Simi, San Giorgio pizza, Pizza Cosí, and the night's special: Wild Mushrooms with black truffle pizza. 

The gnocchi was amazing as it melted in my mouth. It had the perfect balance of tomato, basil, and ricotta: simple yet delicious. All three pizzas were great: crispy crust with just the right about of toppings. However, I especially enjoyed the mushrooms & black truffle one. Honestly, I've had a better \"mushroom & truffle\" version somewhere else, but this one was pretty great too.

Overall thoughts: I would come back again if I was in town. Good food, good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have been to Terroni a few times as it's close to work, however, had never been too impressed with the food until the smoked salmon pizza! This is by far the best thing I've tried on their menu (their pasta leaves a lot to be desired). 

It could also be because I love smoked salmon though."}
{"text":"It's just not very good. A step above East Side Mario and there's nothing wrong with the food but you can do much better in Toronto for the price. Like Enoteca Sociale just a few blocks away!"}
{"text":"Terroni is a jailhouse/courtroom converted into a rustic Italian restaurant. The urban legend is that the restaurant is haunted as hangings took place within the building. The ominous feeling is reinforced when you visit the jail cell type washrooms in the basement. 

The main foyer provides a sit down cafe style atmosphere, beautifully decorated. When entering  the main dining hall, the high ceilings gives the illusion of a spacious dinner, however, the seating arrangements are designed to fill maximum capacity of people.

As for the food, they have a unique selection of gourmet pizzas. I ordered the Al Salmone, a white pizza with smoked salmon dish, which was delicious. The only qualm I had was that it was too plain, but that could also be a credit to the restaurants popularity: Simple dishes with unique twist. 

The servers were very friendly. I did prepare for the worst as from previous reviewers experience, so my expectations were very low. There was a delay when ordering our food, but that could have been due to us having a big group (28 people). We were also seated in two separate tables and our server kindly asked us if we wanted our food first since it was ready.  

I generally am not in the area too often, but the ambiance and unique food selection wouldn't stop me from going again."}
{"text":"Location: Queen Street West, Toronto
Items Ordered: C't Mang (16.95) + Ravioli di Zio Paperone ($17.95) + Torta Calda al Cioccolato ($6.95)

After a day of soaking in sun and people watching in Trinity  Bellwoods, (tough day), my friend and I felt the need to indulge in this much talked about warm, dark chocolate cake from Terroni's. See, I have a friend that is proficient in the art of baking, so she has some credibility when it comes to gushing over a cake and constantly telling me how good is it. Plus, this baker not only recommends it but she has to have it at least twice a week herself. 

Of course there was a line up around 6pm on a Sunday to get into the well-known pizzeria, but luckily the line wasn't too long to accommodate our two people party. However, we did get seated in a booth near the entrance, which was not awesome since it's parallel to the lineup of people waiting to be seated. This makes it a little awkward as hungry restaurant goers can watch our food come in, make bitter faces at us as the smell of hot pizza and the sight of us devouring it makes them jealous and not to mention, those bitter, hungry people are in such close proximity to the booth that they can hear our conversations about them. Point being, try not to get seated in the booths near the entrance. 

We ignored the noise and decided to have a proper dinner before dessert. We asked the waitress for pizza recommendations and decided to go with her favourite, the C't Mang; white pizza with mozzarella, gorgonzola, fresh pears, walnuts, smoked prosciutto and honey. It was beyond lovely! The sharp, strong flavour of the gorgonzola paired with the sweetness of the pears and honey was sexy. I highly recommend it! 

I am a huge fan of Terroni's Ravioli di Zio Paperone; homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano. I've had it twice before at the Yonge & Adelaide location and found it to be better than the one on Queen West. Something was missing from this one, not sure what. 

Alas, it came time to order and eat the Torta Calda al Cioccolato. Too stuffed to order one each, which was the original plan, my friend and I split it. Okay, here goes, this warm, dome-like, flourless, dark chocolate cake, drizzled with white chocolate gnache was sinfully delicious. Soft, moist, filled with a mini mountain of chocolate lava flowing out of it, without the rest of the cake being soggy is really amazing. 10/10. 

If you are not coming for the pizza, it's totally worth just coming for the torta. However do come for the pizza. All is good."}
{"text":"This place has so many different rooms/areas it seems, very cool and interesting.  I've only been here once and was plunked in what seemed to be the \"family section\" with my date, but we were sent over free appetizers almost immediately as a 'thanks for sitting in this section' type of gesture.  I think, anyway.  

I had the same pasta I always eat at the Terroni on Queen, and it was great as usual.  The server was really nice and attentive and helpful with wine suggestions.  

I love the location of this restaurant (I'm biased, but whatever), and it has a nice patio area too for the warm weather.  There's a massive LCBO nearby plus several dessert places and bars.

This location takes reservations, another plus.

*Edited* - I somehow never knew they had a nice and huge, rooftop patio.  Loved it up there."}
{"text":"I've gone here countless times, and I've ordered the same thing every time (except once when I had pizza)....so this review is kind of stupid, but all I know is that I always walk away mega-full and very happy about it.   

The only thing that bothers me is when I'm stuck at one of the tables crammed between other tables, and they are VERY close together so it's hard to not overhear or be overheard (I wouldn't recommend this place for a super-romantic/whispering in your honey bun's ear type of night).  

The servers have always been super nice, and patient with my bf and his beer-choosing dilemmas.    Waiting in a lineup in the cold sucks since this place doesn't take resos (dunno if that's changed in recent times), but the lineup USUALLY goes quite quickly.  

I dig the patio out back, it's cool.

I'd go here more often than I already have if I didn't live right near Terroni Bar Centrale."}
{"text":"I came to Terroni for the food but I come BACK for the peperoncini - much like the granny & Frank's Red Hot, I'd put that sh*t on everything. 
But seriously, nothing but love for Terroni. They were very accommodating for our group of 10 (plus a baby stroller!) and our waiter gave us a great wine recommendation. The historic building (and bathrooms!) are very cool too."}
{"text":"O M G

I finally tried this place!! To be honest, I think I did years ago when I was a pickier, less foodie version of myself so in that case, that doesn't count because I probably ordered the simplest thing on the menu and tried to simplify it even more with substitutions ..boooooring!!!

So anyway, my boyfriend is Italian and I've heard numerous people rave about this place so decided to take him here on our most recent date night. We made an online reservation and got there a bit early, but were still seated right away. It was a week night so obviously it was quieter than say a weekend. I specifically chose the Adelaide location because it is a former jail as I learned on a ghost walk I did downtown last halloween.

I used the bathroom quickly after we first got there. It was in the basement. It's really cool down there because it still looks like a prison and has all the cells and stuff! Definitely recommend making a trip down. 

We got some arugula salad to start with Italian tuna and ordered it without anchovies because yuck. It was alright, nothing spectacular, I could have made a better one at home and Italian tuna tastes like canned tuna. Yuck! But not yuck enough to ruin the experience. No no no.

For our mains we decided to go with pasta dishes. I usually eat healthy but couldn't resist some of the options!  I got the ravioli di zio paperone (say that 10 times fast) the ravioli was stuffed with duck confit, figs and butternut squash and was surrounded by mushrooms. It was unreal! One of the best pastas I've ever had in my life! Until I tried my boyfriends. He got the tonnarelli alla norcina, aka a really awesome pasta containing a ton of sausage and truffle shavings. I've had truffle oil before but never shaving and OH MY GOD. The taste is so good and unexplainable. Apparently buying an actual black truffle costs a ton of money but I get why. The taste is like nothing else I've ever tasted before. It's addicting and leaves you wanting more. Kind of like a drug!! Anyway, you get the point, it was good, beyond good.

We obviously didn't have dessert because we were too full to move-oh well!

It was by far the best Italian food I've ever had minus the salad and I cannot wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say that this was the best italian food iv ever eaten, so delicious and fresh and the only reason im not giving a 5 star review is because, after my meal i was still hungry, that was the disappointing part, but its worth a try if your not really hungry, at least you will love what you eat."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the food is to die for..
but OMG I honestly think its a requirement that the wait staff has to have a bitchy attitude. I've been to the terroni on Adelaide and the one on Yonge N and both times the wait staff was intolerable to deal with. A friend of mine who isn't Italian had a couple of question and the waitress laughed at his pronunciation and proceeded to act rude. Secondly I ordered the small plate of olives to nibble on and they were never brought to the table and were still on my bill. Wait staff are miserable and rude."}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my friend's birthday with 5 other people. We got a mixed meats and cheese appetizer which consisted of TWO pieces of prosciutto, 4 salami and 4 what seemed like cheaper kind of bologna. Two cubes of cheese, 4 grapes and 3 crostini. This board can barely count as an appetizer for one, let alone for more people and for $23 I really expect more than 2 pieces of prosciutto laid out side by side on a board bigger than my torso.

For mains, we got pizzas and raviolis. While my friends said ravioli tasted great, there were also about 7 of them on the plate for $23? Again for the price they are, seems unfair, especially for how much food you get out of a pizza for $18. 

Now for the pizza. I had the one with spicy sausage and smoked cheese and while the flavour was very intense (although the sausage was not spicy whatsoever), I found the sauce a little bland and pizza INCREDIBLY SOGGY. To the point of I could roll it up and eat it as a fruit roll-up - $4 frozen pizza comes out crispier than this. I also noticed that Terroni's pizza ended up on BlogTo as one of the best pizzas in Toronto so I was really excited, but it was nothing to write home about - the sogginess won over he great flavour. 

We had a bottle of their cheaper wine ($45) which was great, however the prices of wine by the glass are a little much. 

We were seated in the basement with two other large parties and it was impossible to have a conversation. While the waiter was very nice and accommodating, she kept walking past my chair and slightly pushing it every time. 

Unless the pizzas come out less soggy next time, I probably would not return."}
{"text":"Very Good Quality & Fresh Ingredient make food simple but delicious !!!!

best pizza : C't Mang ( forgot the exact name, but something very close )
it is a pizza that u wouldn't order when u see the ingredient but u will never forget it after u tried it ! 

C't Man is a pizza that has pears (yes ! pears ! ), walnut,  prosciutto and sth. else ! 
it is not one of those pizza u think u need a lots of Cheese and meatball and all add up grissy and fatting.  C't Man is very delightful and super delicious ! like SUPER ! 

Fried Calamari is sth. very simple but Tasty ! you don't need creamy tartar sauce or dill sauce ! a bit of lemon juice would work it all out ! 


The interior of this restaurant is also very \"Italian\" ~ extra tall celling, open space, window on top with natural sunlight, old Roman style decoration. wooden table."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night on the outdoor patio and we had reservations. Despite the extremely humid weather, it was still worth staying out in the heat. The aesthetics were so romantic and pretty! Our server was great and she checked in with us many times. She also shared good tips and helped us go through the menu. 

We ordered the spinach tortellini and the \"Al Salmone\" pizza, and a bottle of white wine. All the pizzas are definitely worth it because they're huge! But it is kind of inconvenient that they don't come sliced. The tortellini wasn't worth its price point for the serving size. Expect to pay a little bit more for quality Italian food. Each entree was around $20 and the bottle of wine was about $60. They also gave complimentary bread with olive oil. This wasn't that good at all but it was free anyway. However, our food tasted delicious!! 

The one reason that it wasn't 5 stars was because the communication between the servers and the kitchen staff are not great. The man that brought us our food, gave the wrong plate to the wrong person. He also rearranged our entire table for him to place our plates down and it was an extremely awkward experience. They should communicate which person ordered what so that they can place the plate in front of the right person. 

Overall, this place was amazing and I can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I was really confused by the reviews on Yelp about this restaurant.  Even the low rating reviews gave such a great review of the food, but complained about service.  Well, it was our first night in Toronto and it was between here and Campagnolo, but we decided to go with the more casual vibe.  We love the neighborhood it's in and walking in...cute, cute, cute!  And were sat with the perfect server, Jeff!  He was so helpful and friendly, and really guided us through the menu.  We did choose a few of our own dishes, but also went with a few of his and his suggestions were better than our choices.  We ordered the Funghi Abssoulti, or however you spell it, and liked it a lot, but it was a little heavy.  He suggested the arugula salad with lemon and parmesan and we really enjoyed that.  My husband wanted the ravioli and that was good.  Jeff also suggested the seseli wine, mmm really great!  He also suggested the flourless cake, the best!  Confession, we sort of licked the plate...with our fingers.  He said the Panacotta wasn't his favorite, but people like it.  I actually enjoyed that more than my husband.  We thought the service was so great, but maybe Jeff, I don't know.  Anyways, overall, we really enjoyed this restaurant and he gave us great suggestions for our next few days here.  Great first night in Toronto!

{"text":"Went to the Terroni patio yesterday for dinner at this location. I've been to all the locations and food at all three are at the same level, that level being very very delicious. 

My go to dishes here are always the Funghi Assoluti which is a baked oyster mushroom served on arugula ... trust me, you must try this. The mushroom is covered with delicious bread crumbs and Parmesan and goes so well with the balsamic arugula. So so good. As a main, my favourite pasta here is the Tonnarelli alla Norcina (Italian black truffles, spicy sausage, pecorino and garlic ... ). Their pizzas are pretty good, my husband actually likes their pizza better than Libretto!

I've never had their meat main dishes, but I've heard from my friends who have that it's better to stick to their pastas and pizzas. Service here is great (our waitress was Maia and she was great!) and in the summer, their patio is the perfect place to have some wine and a delicious meal. All in all, a great meal every time, never a disappointment."}
{"text":"I happened to look at the other reviews and am quite amazed at the variety of experiences.  Ours was much more positive than negative.  The decor is perhaps reminiscent of an Eataly store, with shelves of Italian products that are actually for sale.  Yes, it is a busy place - packed on a Wednesday evening - but I found the noise level not too much for conversation.

Our server was great.  He had a perfect British accent from a good school, but when I ordered a Sicilian wine, he told us that he was Sicilian (with an English mother) and recommended another, better bottle from his family vineyard.  I'm still not sure I believe his story, but the wine was excellent and he sure knew how to pronounce all of the menu offerings.

We started with the Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo, a good sized board of cheese, salumi and olives and a delightful little pot of walnuts and almonds in honey.  Totally ample for the three of us.  For our mains, my wife loved her choice of the ragu of the day.  My brother had fish with mussels and roasted veggies.  I picked the Ravioli di Zio Paperoni, but found them a bit bland.

Portion sizes are really what normal people should eat, especially if you have a starter and dessert.

I finished with an exquisite gelato pistachio and my brother had a flour less chocolate cake with a delicious sauce.  We all finished with excellent coffees.

It is not cheap but not unreasonable either.  Dinner with wine and tip cost about $100 per person, although the wine at $95 was one of the reasons for the overall tab."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of my friends for a friend's 16th birthday party. The woman that served us was a little rude and slow but it was understandable because it was a Friday night. What was not understandable was that she neglected to tell us that the water she was serving us costed $6 PER BOTTLE. 
As for the food, I got the Capricciosa Pizza and it was AMAZING. (10/10) I also got the Flourless Cake (I don't exactly remember the name) for dessert and it was also very good (a little warning: it's very chocolate-y)."}
{"text":"I ended up getting an afternoon drink here with some girlfriends. The outdoor space in the back is quite lovely, and I wish I had had more time to hang out. The beers were not as interesting as the wine and cocktail options. (There's a design-your-own gin and tonic section.)

The space is posh and elegant. It's great for lots of types of gatherings. We noticed people on dates, catching up with friends, going out with small babies, and larger groups."}
