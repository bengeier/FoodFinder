{"text":"My smoked meat pouting tasted like tuna fish. They need to either clean their knives, use separate knives, or find a way to make a better smoked meat."}
{"text":"I always stop at Lester's in Montreal airport to get their fries - they are made fresh and superb! It would be difficult to beat and is worth the calories."}
{"text":"What's the hype about?  If you want a sandwich wait til you get to New York.  The poutine is too big to eat before a flight and the gravy is tasteless.  Cheese curds are sparse considering the size. 

So, eat your poutine downtown and hold off on the sandwich until you get to JFK or LGA."}
{"text":"This deserves a 0. I ordered the \"special\" smoked meat sandwich which came with a pickle, coleslaw and a bag of fries. Where should I start? The sandwich was tiny, the bread was broken in pieces when I opened it, the meat was mediocre at best. The coleslaw was a joke, not creamy but super dry and acidic (it didn't have any dressing). The bag of fries was drenched in oil, the fries were ultra soggy and tasted sweet. I don't even like pickles but they were the only acceptable thing in my order. Total: $20. I have never had such a horrendous meal for that price. If you all think that this is worth to try, you must not know any better... Ew."}
{"text":"Sept 4 2015 1pm 2 hrs till my flight to duh where else Vegas lol, had to have some lunch before my flight, instead of charging ridiculous prices on my credit card on the in flight dine, we decided to get a famous Lesters Smoked meat sandwich. Big freakn mistake, the counter was empty we were served instantly our sandwiches packed in a paper bag with pickles and fries and cokes, 22$ a person with tip. My god a what a waste. Sandwich was barely the size of a folded in half passport , bread was dried up been left out, and the fries was luke warm. Pickles and coke was fine, glad i paid 20$ for a pickle. Not! Last time I buy anything here."}
{"text":"Look, this is a deli at the airport!  I mean you're just going to grab a shrink-wrapped sandwich and get on your plane and hope its not going to make you sick okay?  And yet the smoked turkey sandwich I grabbed was possibly the best turkey sandwich I've ever had!  The smoked turkey was truly, truly awesome.  Fresh bread, amazingly good.

Oh, and they also have Montreal Smoked Meat vacuum packed and ready to go.  Highly recommended.  By gate C78."}
{"text":"I was a bit anxious because I had not managed to get poutine in downtown Montreal while I was there and the three places I could possibly get poutine in the US departure gates side of the airport did not have the best ratings. However, I was very impressed with the poutine at Lester's. The fries and gravy were freshly made at the time I got there. I don't have the best reference for poutine, but I was very satisfied. Furthermore, I didn't encounter any of the service issues that previous reviewers had mentioned and received nothing but friendly service."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is as a comparison to other \"airport food\". This place was awesome. I don't know how the prices were, because this is the only place in the airport that I ate at. They had a smoked meat sandwich which that was really a hot pastrami. Fresh cut fries that were perfect. This little airport deli was a true gem!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a simple grilled cheese sandwich, asked what cheeses they had available and they said cheddar and swiss. 

Swiss not being a real cheese, I went for the cheddar, after all, it did say \"deli\" in the name. I was excited. 

What I got was a 4\" in diameter-- which was perfect, on rye, grilled cheese, with American cheese, also, not a cheese, more like a polymer.

Needless to say, that's not what I was told I was getting."}
{"text":"For those that miss out on Schwartz, Lester's Deli
Express is an airport option that offers an opportunity to try both the Montreal dishes of smoked meat sandwich or poutine. 

Be warned though, this is an airport location and Lester's is nowhere as near an institution as Schwartz and there's a reason why. My order:

Smoked Meat Sandwich - $11.95.  I opted for the sandwich only and added a deli pickle and it was close to the meal price that included both the pickle and French fries.  While 7 ounces of meat is served and the presentation is similar to Schwartz (overfilled sandwich with small pieces of rye bread) the truth is in the meat quality.  While Schwartz was a heavenly mix of Pastrami and beefy smoked meat, Lester's deli tasted like a cross between smoked meat and low grade baloney. 

If you don't have time to go to the real thing, this is (sadly) one of Montreal Airport's passable eateries but don't expect a divine experience.  

Lester's accepts credit cards including Amex."}
{"text":"Yep, your best bet in this international terminal. Can't complain.

The smoked meat is good, and the poutine is legit. Fresh fries, decent powder gravy (very beefy), and actual curds. Skip that awful sit-down place, and grab some smoked meat at Lester's."}
{"text":"The owner is interesting.
The guys who work there told me that they use
Old meat people always get sick. They re use the meat and just put fresh lettuce when the sandwich is expired. People get sick off the fries all the time. I can't even say what's safe to eat there because it's most likely nothing. Syrian guy who works there and the philippino guy are both extremely cool guys the Owner sometimes."}
{"text":"The smoked meat poutine was huge, high quality, and a tasty farewell to the city. Friendly service. Doesn't get much better in an airport than local flavor at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"If you find yourself at Montreal's Trudeau Airport...you could do worse than Lester's. They have an assortment of pre-made sandwiches along with made to order items like Poutine, and grilled cheese. For airport food it's really not bad and not terribly pricey."}
{"text":"The rudest service I have ever received in Montreal. On 2017-08-03 at around 10am, I approached the counter and was ignored by the shorter slightly plump guy working behind the register, even though no other clients were present. I ultimately caught his attention and requested a cappuccino, which is on their menu. This person, without a modicum of respect, gnarled a sharp \"no\", looked away with disgust, and proceeded to ignore me. It is impossible to put into words the rudeness I have experienced, as adjectives alone cannot do his vile behaviour justice. 

Bewildered and confused, I wasn't sure what had happened. Luckily, his colleague came and elucidated the situation: apparently the espresso machine was out of order, which is understandable. 

However, I was completely appalled at the way I was treated by the first guy: not just as a potential customer, but as a fellow human being. 

Initially, I hesitated, but I ultimately asked for the shorter plump guy's name. He was unwilling to give it. This just further confirms his incivility and disrespect. Why conceal your name if you did nothing wrong? After a mild argument (he tried to justify his behaviour by blaming the malfunctioning espresso machine, which really was besides the point), he ultimately apologized. Whether it was genuine or forced, I did appreciate his apology and said thank you. 

However, I heard him mutter something angrily under his breath in some foreign language along with the F-word. His words were barely audible I walked away, but negated his previous apology. I would definitely not have written this review if it weren't for that."}
{"text":"They serve a great greasy bag o' fries and their deli pickles (buy at least 3, trust me) are delicious. 

Smoked meats are what most are stocking up on pre-flight here but I just wanted the fresh fries and as a bonus I got to hear a woman describe the smoked meat poutine as a \"meat salad\" to her child. Pretty sure they were American to the core. 

I felt a few heart blips away from a coronary after the fry bag and it the condiment bar could have been better but it was a stop I didn't regret."}
{"text":"Usually airports are chock-full of multinational fast food chains, but YUL surprised me with this gem of a place.

I got the smoked meat poutine, which was made of Belgian-style fries, cheese curds, gravy, and bits of chopped smoked meat. This is how I imagined poutine should be. The fries were the right consistency, being mushy and not crunchy. They soaked up the gravy very well. The cheese curds were well-melted after I let it sit for a bit. The smoked meat was salty and well-spiced. I possibly would have appreciated slices of smoked meat across the top of the poutine rather than chopped, but it was okay.

If i had one other complaint, maybe the smoked meat and the gravy combo was too salty for my tastes."}
{"text":"For a small little place in an airport, my expectations were fairly low.   I walked away pleasantly surprised.  My wife got a burger, and I got the Montreal smoked meat poutine.  The burger was made to order and was a pretty good sized.  The poutine was also delicious - huge, piping hot and fresh... no complaints at all.  They also have a pretty good drink selection and a wide variety of sandwiches.  The prices are also very reasonable.  Overall, pretty impressive for airport food!"}
{"text":"For airport food this place is great.  If you are at the YUL airport you have to check this place out.  I had the smoked meat sandwich and it was delicious.  The guys working there were really nice too."}
{"text":"I had 9 min to go and the gentleman offered to cook me up a burger in 5 minutes, but he needed an asian lady's help with cashier.   He asks for help and she lazily says \" you need my help?\" Without even looking up.  He looks apologetic and I ended up getting a sandwich next door."}
{"text":"I don't know anything about smoked meat, but I know they give you a pile of it here with the sandwich.  At about $8 usd it's still a better deal than NYC, where though I assume larger, you pay upwards of $25.  That's robbery.  The meat here was moist and tasty.  Given the horrible review about sanitation, I'll update if I get sick...but I find that hard to believe."}
