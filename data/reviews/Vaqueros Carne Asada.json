{"text":"Best tacos in Mesa. Everything is made fresh to order in the barrel-shaped stand in front of you. Al fresco ambiance galore!"}
{"text":"This place was great about 2 years ago but clearly things have changed. 

Yesterday on my lunch break I was craving Carne Fries. I ordered them with NO guacamole, ADD extra cheese. I was charged for the cheese too because the total was $10 something. 
I get back to my cube at work only to find that the fries were smothered in guacamole with a less than normal amount of cheese. The carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy.
Not to mention the cashier was a tad bit cranky AND she never advised me of the fee to use my debit card. 

Sorry Vaqueros but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food we have found since moving to AZ in 5 years.  Menudo 7 days a week. And I hate menudo Mexico but will eat theirs."}
{"text":"Best horchatta I've found around here! They also have killer carne asada fries and breakfast burritos!!! Weekly stop for our household! Love the drive thru for late night tacos as well!"}
{"text":"I totally disagree Vaqueros is better than Federico's.  The food at Vaqueros is insipid flat and greasy."}
{"text":"Bad customer service every time I go to they forget my takeout and I always get burnt Chile rellenos"}
{"text":"Favorite mexican in town, best value too. 12 rolled tacos piled high for $6. Best Chili Relleno burritos! Muy bueno"}
{"text":"Decent food. The customer service is horrible. They like to argue with people. I don't know how many times I went to the drive thru in the mornings sigh says open an you can see people inside looking at you. But no one answers drive thru or window."}
{"text":"The drive thru is supper Dirty and the ppl there are Rude ! They don't even say thanxs or a smile . There are also tons of flys there !!!"}
{"text":"Woman taking orders through  the drive through  has no manners ...very rude and unprofessional  ...it's a shame the food is quite well but the customer service  needs work...  i must say that bad customer service will definitely kill my experience ...and today it did just that ...it also  makes me not want to go back"}
{"text":"It is like eating at my sister-in laws without having to do the dishes. 
My favorite is the polo as-ado burro!"}
{"text":"Went to the 7th Street & Roser restaurant. Ordered 2 of the Menudo on Sunday to go. I got home  opened them up & tasted them. So salty, I mean so salty like sea water. Un eatable. They would do nothing about it. I will never buy anything there again. Bad Menudo. ....... I give them no stars if I could."}
{"text":"Usually all my co workers will get burritos for breakfast got to work to find out they messed up my burrito called and was told to bring back my reciept to get correct order or money back to get there to be told all well so wont be buying there horrible service gross inside had never been inside before"}
{"text":"We were looking for \"hole in the wall Mexican\" and yelp led us here. We ate in. Food was out and on our table within 3 minutes (no exaggeration). Food was delicious... Tacos were a bit greasy"}
{"text":"You have to love Vaqueros for Mexican food. I would give them 5 stars but they are lacking on their sauces. That watery vinegar they give at the drive through is less than spectacular. They have some good Carne Asada and amazing rolled tacos. They just need to put some extra effort in to hooking me up with some tasty salsa. I am also happy they are taking credit cards now now. Cash only is a pain. They are constantly painting that building. It must have 30 coats of paint."}
{"text":"Always here for their California burritos... The burritos are huge and can be easily shared by two people.  Their jalapeno and carrots are somethin I havent seen at other similar places, id recommend it if you,re lookin for some heat! The drive thru service is fast and friendly.  I have seen they did remodel the inside seating and does not look as,roughed up as before... There is a drawback when using your card to pay- 50¢ addtl charge, which shud b done away with."}
{"text":"I would much rather STARVE and let my stomach eat at my spine than to come back here for lunch. Rude employees, dried out food and a very small place."}
{"text":"It's been quite some time since I've been here given the fact I no longer live down the street from this joint.  I've been coming here even before it was Vaqueros so I know they've been doing something right to stick around this long.  The old days of Vaqueros featured cheaper eats with monster size portions.  So when pulling up and seeing that the prices have gone up a bit I was disappointed only to wonder if their portion size went in the opposite direction like most Mexican fast food joints (I.E filibertos).  I ordered the usual of Super Nachos and a California Burro.  I brought it home to my dad and daughter.  I opened the bag up and what do you know, a big monster burro sat there along with a tray of Super Nachos packed to the top! I was once again reminded why I come here when in need for a good Mexican fix! Yes, the prices have gone up but what hasn't these days.  I will say this, if you are the owner of this joint I highly recommend doing some remodeling of the property.  This place looks even worse than before and I can see many potential customers deciding not to pull in based on looks.  Clean this place up and your business will thrive even more. Otherwise, eat up people! It's worth the price of admission! 5 stars for food, -1 for appearance."}
{"text":"There is a vaqueros  near where I live so I thought that I'd try this location. what a mistake my food was not even warm it was cold,  not to mention the bad service. The restrooms are filthy ! Need I say more!  Nothing like the vaqueros in south Phoenix near my house !"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken burro.  It was very good and filling.  It had sour cream, chicken, lettuce, tomato, and lots of cheese.  Staff was patient and were able to handle our difficult order."}
{"text":"I love the taquitos and beef tacos. I rarely order anything else. And they are always tasty. But wverytime i walk in someone is eating the shrimp ceviche and boy does it look good.

I started coming here before they had the current name because my husbands office was down the way.

The only reason i am giving them 4 stars is because the bathroom is outside and the drive thru is at a weird angle.  Also, the beans are a bit on the dry side."}
{"text":"I dont know if im a fair judge of comida...i always get the same thing...beef tacos and/or rolled tacos. But its always,good. The green salsa is TRUTH and i mix it with the spicy red one. Lots of locals eating here and lunch crowd.

I have noticed this since it changed hands the beans and rice taste better less dry and more fluffy.

Everyone is always nice and. The cooks bring it hot and quick.

Ive never used the restroom...so i cannot advise on that"}
{"text":"Vaqueros serves monster sized burritos. 1 burrito is big enough for 2 people.  And the burritos are always served super piping  hot. Let it cool down for 5-10 minutes or you'll burn all your taste buds off and won't be able to taste all of the deliciousness.  I recommend the ham & egg, the bacon, egg, potatoe n cheese, and the shredded beef burritos.

The food is good, cheap, and plentiful. The service however really sucks.

Tip- grab a large horchata.

 You're welcome."}
{"text":"It's ok!  Not great and you might get the runs later.  But why do I keep going there?  Well it's down the street and it's fast.  But to me it's better than Taco Feliz or Filibertos.  In my opinion Federico's is better but the one on 35th Ave.  I only get flautas and no rice or beans.  The flautas are really good but....they hardly put enough meat.  If I'm hungry and I'm already almost home I will stop here.  Thankful it only happens once or twice a year.  I'm not brave to try anything because of past experiences.  I tried the tacos, tortas, and burros.  Just buy flautas to be in the safe side.   Take a tums tablet right after too!"}
{"text":"It has been a tough place to find. Living in Phoenix there are plenty of Mexican restaurants to go to. All serve the same thing- tacos, Tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and so on. It's nothing new. So what sets this place apart is the taste of their food and the diversity of the items available. Their portions are large. So what do I mean by diversity in food. Well, Gorditas, pozole, tamales, menudo, sopes, flautas, and all of the other stuff offered in both corn or flower tortillas. Their willingness to customize your order is definitely something to be praised. Try this place out. It's really something to brag about."}
{"text":"Food isnt that great - and their employees dont try to speak English even though they can!  Come on people, the is the USA and thats coming from a Hispanic!"}
{"text":"I was so happy when Vaqueros expanded to this location. The same people who own the one on 18th Ave and Southern also own this one! This is an easy place to get good traditional Mexican food for lunch. The burritos are always quickly served and are humongous for the price. If you dine in, there are free chips available. I usually get the beef taco combo which is consistently good and includes moist refried beans and rice. This isn't a very fancy place but it's sure to curb your Mexican food cravings. PS- They make a killer Super Nacho/Fry (which should be shared unless you plan on going into cardiac arrest)."}
{"text":"I recently stayed in south mountain, and when looking for a restaurant opened late, I happened upon this place. No complaints - great food, huge portion & nice employees. Definitely reccomend."}
{"text":"They charge you a Fee for using your Debit Card... That's illegal, especially when they dont tell you!!! They have this tiny obscure sign by the register.

Food is alright, staff is not too friendly."}
{"text":"I love that Vaqueros will make any burrito small size for those of us that don't require a 3 lb burrito. The breakfast burros are some of the best in town but lost a star when they somehow lost their recipe to the green sauce. Yuck"}
{"text":"Come here a couple times a year when I watch the Angels in spring training. Been here about 6/7 times. 

What I order: Carne Asada plate cooked Medium (beans + rice+ corn tortillas) and/or chicken tacos. Carne Asada is seasoned well, not tough, two large thin pieces, easy to tear and put into a tortilla. Chicken tacos are loaded with juicy chicken. Beans and rice aren't out of this world but are delicious. 

Condiment Bar: very well taken care of, clean not all sloppy, 3 types of salsa ( I like the green one, not spicy, just good flavor), crisp cucumbers, fresh lime wedges, carrots, chips. 

Cleanliness: very clean and not cluttered. Everything is in order. You can see back into the kitchen, also looks clean and orderly. 

Staff: I have never seen them just sitting there chatting to each other or on their phones. They're always working! Wether it's re stocking, cleaning, etc...

Other menu items: large selection to order. All your typical orders plus traditional ones like cabeza, lengua, adobadas, breakfast  plates, chorizo, machaca, menudo, large delicious looking shrimp cocktail, and Mexican soda. All those items seem to be very popular. In fact, they've ran out of menudo when we've tried ordering it before. 

They have a drive thru as well. 

Price: very reasonable!

I can't believe everyone here for spring training baseball (Tempe Diablo stadium is 1 mile but I think less) isn't eating here!!"}
{"text":"First visit, August 2015 on a Saturday morning about 10am. 

I don't have a real good grasp of this history of this structure but I suspect it's something like a theme building from the 1960s when Highway 60 was the main route into the Phoenix area from the east, back when those tourist motels in that area were hot properties with crowds of tourists. That's my theory anyway.

Here's the process: Drive-up and park somewhere. There is outdoor seating with limited shade. I don't think there is a toilet. Consider you'll be sitting waiting in the heat for about 10+ minutes. There's limited shade unless you wait in your car.

The menu is a collection of photographs on a sign on the side of the building, plus a smaller more traditional text based menu right next to it. Most of the menu does not show the prices, so bring enough CASH and pay whatever they tell you. I got meals for three adults for about $20. 

I ordered two ala carte tacos,  a two-taco platter with rice and beans, and a nachos deluxe platter. All were served in styrofoam folding meal containers with extra sauce in tiny covered cups, plastic forks and napkins. It took about ten minutes from order to delivery.

The nachos were huge. The ala carte tacos were great buy they need sauce.

I think you can walk up and order something like \"Two tacos please\" and ignore the menu and they'll make it for you. 

I've been to Mexico many times years ago back when Juarez was very safe and fun. My experience with Mexican cooking was that without added sauce I found their food bland by American standards. You add the sauce you want to make it as spicy and hot as you like it, not as the restaurant likes it. This place seems to be just like that.

I'm also not a fan of refried beans in general, the texture doesn't appeal to my tongue.  But theirs were very tasty, I'm just not a fan no matter where they come from. 

They don't have a menu online or on paper, so you might drive over and take a photo for yourself.

To sum up, I really like their food and service, the value and location. In fact, I think I'm going to drive over there in about an hour and get more of their wonderful tacos, ala carte. Then I'll add my own Cholula at home. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was fast like filibertos but was so much better. But sadly the closed their doors."}
{"text":"Aww man was iy good. Well as the name says vaqueros Carne Asada we got te carne asada burro, fries, and torta. All were exceptional and a quesadillas that was massive. My kids loved the quesadillas and we thoroughly enjoyed our food the burro was the best. Filled with pico de gayo cilantro and guacamole. I love the way the place looks it is cool and fun. Will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I can't high rate the restaurant. Why.  All I get are carne asada fries. Don't get me wrong they are good but not five star good.  What equals out the the rating is the portion you are given. It is really enough for 2-3 people for 7.50!  Damn good price to me. 

Drive thru service is quick.  Downside is you can't see the inside of the joint, so this may be an off review but take as you may.  
Hands down though you will want to order some carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Perfect carne asada burro. No gristle bits, nice smoky flavor. Huge portion & delicious, slightly spicy green salsa.
But for me, it was the heavenly tortilla. Oh mama, so good.
Only complaint was the huge work van practically blocking the drive thru lane. I have a tiny car, but i barely squished past it. Maybe find another spot, yo! Haha. It was worth the 'struggle.'
And this is also literally the closest food spot next to my house & they are open 24/7! Score!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out and the food was ok, what concerned me was the cleanliness of the kitchen. The floor was really dirty, under the burners or stove seemed to have months of grease buildup etc. 50c extra to use debit or credit card btw."}
{"text":"Big ass Buritos and some of the Best Chili Relenos in the valley! Very crispy tacos.. get the sauce on the side"}
{"text":"Be aware that when you order their signature Carne Asada Fries, you should be VERY hungry. Even though it's really good - lots of well-seasoned meat, guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese on top of a generous serving of fries - you will probably  not be able to finish it. The serving is that humongous; it can feed three people. This small eatery offers lots of combinations and items at low prices. Definitely no fancy atmosphere, but lots of choices and generous servings of good food at low prices make this place a winner,"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast burrito the first time I went here. Wasn't too bad. Seems like burritos are an OK choice. 

This next time, I had the carne asada taco plate. Figured it would be good considering the name of this place. 

Nope - most disgusting carne asada I've ever had. Definitely not freshly cooked. Looked like it was reheated more than once and was pale/tasted like skunked meat.  Left a pretty nasty aftertaste in my mouth. 

The beans were dry and inconsistent in texture. The rice looked/tasted like it's been sitting under a heat lamp. Hard/chewy chunks.  

There's MUCH better fast Mexican food our there.  Take a pass on this one."}
{"text":"For fast food Mexican, it was pretty good. The machaca and egg was delish. My husband gave a thumbs up to the quesadilla and carne asada burrito. Portions were generous. We will be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I like their enchiladas and nachos. I always use the drive thru and so far the food was good and service too."}
{"text":"This place looks horrible from the outside however once the food is in your mouth you forget all about the appearance. The breakfast burritos are heavy as newborn infants and are the perfect end to a night of heavy drinking."}
{"text":"I bought a breakfast Burrito on the way to work, and the first bite had a 2.5\" construction nail in it. I called Vaqueros and asked for a manager and I was hung up on. I have eaten here several times and never had a problem, but I will never take the risk again."}
{"text":"this has got to be the worst Mexican food in all Phoenix I was too lazy to get out of the car and go to amandos brothers a cross the street but that will never happen again."}
{"text":"Vaqueros started off as a late night recommendation for a good breakfast burrito; I had been craving a burrito all day and through the night. Well, when the morning came we went along to Vaquero's as suggested. As soon as I saw the place, I knew that I was going to be in for a treat. I love myself a little dive and Vaquero's is just that. Quantities are large and prices are small, very small.

I took on their breakfast burrito and added carne asada to it. It was one of the biggest burritos that I have ever encountered, but I wasn't discouraged, just hungry. Bite by bite I introduced that flour tortilla wrapped masterpiece to my taste buds until it all rested together happily in my stomach. I was full...really full. I was also extremely ecstatic for getting exactly what I was craving.

Vaqueros is definitely one of the better Mexican places that I've been to in Phoenix. There are so many that it is hard to choose sometimes, but if I'm around South Phoenix and I'm craving some cheap Mexican food, I'll probably be heading over to this place."}
{"text":"Norm R. and I just had ourselves a mini UYE and He suggested we share an order of the Carne Asada Fries. We both ate till full. For $6.50 =)  I cleaned the plate.. Thanks Norm R. for turning me on to this place! This was a Mexican / American hybrid something like Chili Cheese Fries I have had at one of my favorite greasy American burger joints.... Only Waaaaaaaay way way . . Better!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious carne asada! Lost a star because the tables outside are in terrible condition and the music was way too loud to consider eating inside."}
{"text":"Nothing special.   The fish tacos are ok, while the pork carnitas is greasy and not good.  The chips are unremarkable.  The food just didn't taste fresh. I see no reason to return."}
{"text":"I really like the Carnitas here. Unfortunately, today my Carnitas turned out to be Chorizo and Egg."}
{"text":"The costumer service was excellent and the food was pretty good and good price! Cashier was very friendly and always willing to help. Este lugar tiene un buen servicio al cliente y la cajera es muy amigable y dispuesta a ayudar la comida estuvo buena solo le faltaron los jalapeños!"}
{"text":"I think their name should be Vaqueros Grande Burritos  As our burritos were HUGE. 

We stopped in after a hike, inside is reasonably nice all things considered. There is a free chips and salsa bar allays a huge plus and a decent menu. 

I went for a $4.35 vegetarian burrito, it was a mix of just about every non meat ingredients  a place like this has, cheese, lettuce guacamole sour cream etc. It was a bit messy to eat and the sour cream made it quite rich.  The salsa/ hot sauce here is great smooth and quite spicy.

Stop in grab a burrito and be full."}
{"text":"Their burritos are HUGE!! Almost the size of my forearm! But bigger is not always better. It's slightly above all the -bertos places but I've definitely had better. The carne asada just didn't do it for me. I like my asada with nice grilled marks and I didn't find that here. Also, their salsas were boring; it was watered down and no substance. 

I've tried some of the Chorizo here before and that was pretty good. And I've heard the menudo was excellent, but I'm not a fan of menudo so that doesn't suffice.

From what I've read it looks like the Carne Asada fries are the business, which I might give a try the next time I roll through the drive-thru."}
{"text":"W live in the neighborhood and cine here often, betty good consistent food. However, the young lady at the register never smiles. Ever. Makes me uncomfortable, maybe keep her in the beck instead of helping customers?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.   Big portions,  free chips,  good hot sauce,  and generally tasty food.    I got nothing bad to say about 'em."}
{"text":"Really good food. The menu is nearly identical to the filibertos across the street. That's very good considering the filibertos across the street is not like most filibertos. This filibertos is fond of making food out of garbage."}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada Fries. 

I've tasted Filiberto's and it can't even hold a candle to Vaquero's Carne Asada fries.  I didn't know well-cooked fries topped with a humungous amount of meat, guacamole, sour cream, and cheese could be heaven on earth. One $7 take-out box could feed 4 people easily. I always make sure to bring a box home if I ever have guests and they usually end up loving it equally - or more so than me.

I've recently discovered this hole-in-the-wall and honestly, I've been coming back at least twice a month since then. It'll satisfy all your authentic Mexican food cravings especially since they're open 24 hrs!"}
{"text":"Foods quality is good the atmosphere is not that we'll appreciated. :)

1 advice.
 = drive through then eat it at home."}
{"text":"I've only been to this place for breakfast, but boy let me tell you, If you're hungry for a breakfast burrito this is the place to go!  I usually get a bacon egg and cheese burrito, the burrito is huge you can easily split between two people.  The bacon is cooked perfectly and the cheese is gooey and delicious.  Throw some of their green sauce on there and their home made chips and salsa and this is easily my favorite mexican place for breakfast.  I love how you can always see the chefs hard at work in the morning prepping, you can tell they use quality ingredients.  They also remodeled the inside and it looks much nicer now.  I definitely reccomend this place."}
{"text":"My kids LOVE this place. The burritos and servings are HUGE! My kiddies love the super nachos, rolled tacos and the carne asada fries. 3 of us can all share one meal, lol sometimes. Dont think your gonna be able to eat a burrito solo. I tried it once with a breakfast burrito and didnt even make it half way before the \"itis\" had me falling asleep at work! Never again, lol."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants I've eaten at since moving here. I've tried this place Three different times and I was disappointed every single visit. Every time I visit my husband gets carne Asada fries and I've had the Monday special which is the chicken tacos and I've also had a chicken torta on another occasion. Today was my last time at this restaurant. Today I had carne Asada fries I thought to myself, surely they cannot mess this up but it was a disaster I got my fries and drove 10 minutes to my home and when I opened my box the fries were stale, mushy and The toppings were pushed to one side of the box. And I keep my order on the floorboard of the car so that the food doesn't roll all over the car so I don't know how my food got like that in the 10 minute drive to my home. Needless to say I was very disappointed and I will not be going back and I won't recommend anyone eat there the food is tasteless and bland and the presentation is horrible."}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is decent as with all of these \"authentic\" Filaberto-ish Mexican food joints. They are all about the same. 

Like Filiberto's, and other hole-in-the-wall\" Mexican restaurants,  the shop has a less than \"Nice and clean\" look and feel to it. Also just like Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice. Rice is cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!? Who want's a burrito with a pound of meat in it and nothing else anyway??!? You could buy 1 burrito for $3.99, take it home and make enough proper burrito's to feed 4 or 5 people. It's enough meat to gag a goat and it's not taking food cost or the customer into consideration. 

It's a terrible business model overall. It's no Chipotle's, but Chipotle's isn't authentic Mexican fare either.  =0(.

P.S. Armando Brothers is now right across the street."}
{"text":"First time and last time I will be buying any food from Vasqueros. My first impression wasn't great. The drive thru had trash and boxes by the back door. It just looked dirty. My daughter and I bought breakfast burritos on Sunday morning at this location. At first, I was completely happy with my burrito. The size of the burrito was huge and it wasn't bad. Until halfway through my burrito there was a hair sticking out of the burrito. It was between the potatoes, eggs, and pico. I was totally disgusted. I didnt even want to call and get another item off there menu....."}
{"text":"Ah, the old adage, \"if you see a [insert ethnic minority] eating in a [same ethnic minority] restaurant, then you KNOW it must be good.\"

While this is true, and especially in the case of Vaqueros, this burrito joint is the type of place that can dissolve racial discrimination and bring all the colors of the planet together under one orange and yellow striped world, where the rivers flow with beans and cheese, the mountains are  heaps of carne asada, the trees harvested as flautas, and the raindrops on your tongue taste like freshly made red salsa.

Seriously.  Their asada burritos are filled with insanely large portions of meat and guac.  Their rolled tacos have a heap of cheese and guac and their red sauce is perfect for dipping.  I've even had their breakfast burritos which are PACKED with eggs, bacon, and cheese.  If they could put it in a can, it could be packaged as a hangover cure and possibly the antidote for bird flu.

I also dig on their churros, which are not made in-house, but dammit, they are delicious anyway.  I usually get the strawberry-filled and afterwards I feel like i have violated the Geneva Convention for war crimes against my body.

Oh, they also mention on their signage that they are open 24 horas, but I'll never know because I'd never jaunt down here to this part of hood armed with only a lengua burrito."}
{"text":"This is probably the closest place I have near me if I am craving some mexican food. I usually get the adobada burrito. Its really good and the staff is good too. I never had a complaint there at all. They are open most of the time too, sometimes even 24 hours. So, if you looking for something decent or craving a late night mexican meal you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This place use to be great 12 months ago when it was under a different name and management group. Now it is just plain bad food. I ordered a polle asado burrito that was just plain old nasty. I feel bad giving this place 1 star so I'll give it 2 stars since a buddy of mine frequents this place. There are half a dozen better fast food Mex places with a 1 mile radius so don't even bother with this place."}
{"text":"This place definitely qualifies as a hole in the wall.  The food is cheap and delish.  I've never been inside and I'm just fine with that.  The less I know the better, hence the 3 stars.  I don't eat here often, but when I do it's yummy and fills my tummy.  I don't choose this place for the ambiance.  It's about the food.  My husband has tried a few of their burritos and is always pleased.  I always get the carne asada french fries and they are so good!  Don't let what it looks like on the outside drive you away; give Vaqueros a try!"}
{"text":"Disgusting.  A huge sewer roach was found inside the burrito wrapping.  Not a regular roach a huge sewer roach.  How does that happen!!  Health hazard.  Making me sick just thinking about it."}
{"text":"While I was eating, a coach roach ran across my table!  I immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Thought we would try their namesake and get two carne asada burritos to try it out. These were really good! The meat was seasoned well (maybe a little too salty but still tasty) with fresh pico and a nice layer of guacamole. The tortilla was nice and chewy, just the way I like it. There was a very nice man working the window, so customer service was great too. We will be back."}
{"text":"I normally get my breakfast burrito from Salsitas on Central, but decided to give this place a shot as I've read some fantastic reviews... Unfortunately, their ham, cheese, and egg burrito left much to be desired. I love drenching my burrito in salsa and their salsa had little flavor, taste, or spice. The burrito was large, but 90% of it was ham with little egg or cheese.. and about halfway through I bit into an eggshell. Save yourself a $1 and drive a mile down the road for better taste all-around if you're looking for a bomb breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Solid three.  Prices are pretty good and the service has always been very nice.  I'd agree the atmosphere isn't amazing, but I came to eat, not take in a view.  If you need to, get it to go, and drive up South Mountain and gaze at the city lights down below.  I'm cheap, so the fifty cent charge for cards pisses me off.  WTH is that?  The food is decent, and the portions are large."}
{"text":"I order rolled tacos with just cheese and I got meat in them. I ordered a side of rice and I got French fries. Terrible service, but the fries were good. I do not eat meat and my lunch was ending so the food was wasted along with my money. I am still hungry."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Wayyyy too salty. I ordered a chx quesadilla. Probably the easiest thing to make. The chx was dry, barely any cheese. The pico was fresh and good. But the guacamole was already brown. They have the windows painted so you can't see in. That scares me. They gave me one.. ONE! Red sauce. I need at least four for a quesadilla. I'll never eat here again. Oh yeah, and it was super expensive! Which is crazy since the place looks like a giant bucket of dung. I wish there was zero star choice"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! Went through the drive thru with a friend and ordered the pollo platter, when I got home I had discovered a black long hair in my food. Took it back and got something else. This was the first time is ever been there, and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Is there some sort of secret war to see who can serve the largest burritos in the valley? If so, Vaquerros just dropped a huge bomb on the competition. I was straight INTIMIDATED by my burrito. I questioned now only WHY someone felt the need to make them so huge, but HOW it was able to cost significantly less than the competition. 

They prepare their meat a little differently. It seemed to be tenderized and rather finely chopped. It was marinated in...well, I can't put my finger on it. But the meat, pico, and guac inside seemed to pack quite a bit of lime. The salsa was bold, and I appreciated it not seeming to have any salt at all. Look, it was like 2am when I went here so I can't recall all the details. Just know this tastes different than all our local chains, and is well worth the change of pace."}
{"text":"Just didn't work out for us. . .

We stopped by the drive thru Sunday morning to pick up two breakfast burritos.  My wife's had enough liquid in it to fill a small coffee cup.  It was about as hot as coffee as well and spilled down the front of her.  As she was driving at the time, it was a bit alarming to hear her yell in pain--frankly, I thought she was going to lose control of the car for a minute.  She ended up with a mild first degree burn on her stomach.

The burrito was BIG but only fair tasting.  After this experience, we're not sure if we want to return.  YMMV."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  Reasonably priced items, what I order at least.  Love their chips!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for lunch the other day and were really impressed. The portions were humongous, and the prices were very reasonable given the portion size (and quality!). You know, sort of like Applebee's current \"right portion, right price\" promotion, except that at Vaqueros, the portions make you feel like you're getting a lot of real value for your money. The decor is no-frills, but the woman working at the register was super-friendly, and the free salsa bar with pickled carrots and chips was a great way to start our lunch. 

I had the carnitas (~$7.50) and my husband had the burro/enchilada combo plate ($6.50). The carnitas weren't as savory as the ones I've had elsewhere (Los Dos Molinos is a good example), but they were seasoned well and came with some of the best rice and beans I've ever had. My husband's seasoned beef (in the burro) was also not intensely fllavorful but was still decent. His enchilada was a real standout; the sauce had just the right amount of chile flavor and spice and the cheese was perfectly gooey - not soggy, not congealed. We wished we had forgone things with meat and just ordered 6 cheese enchiladas as our meal! Overall, though, we were definitely impressed with the food and would definitely return. 

Just as an FYI - they do take credit cards but charge a transaction fee ($.50) so you might want to just bring cash. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention - they have a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"The cashier don't understand you and the order was messed up. Plus they forgot my sour cream and when the cook was dipping it that all looked at me smiling like he put something in it. Never again will I eat there.   Will be reporting this."}
{"text":"Okay, so we're in Arizona  helping my brother and his family move last week.  After sweating constantly since hitting the Arizona border, my brother suggests we take a break and grab some grub at his local Mexican restaurant.  We pull up to a place called Vaqueros, small little hole in the wall and I prepare my taste buds for a delicious, satisfying meal.

Service was quick, staff were friendly, but the food just did no justice to my carnivorous appetite.  I ordered a carne asada plate w/beans and rice and corn tortillas.  The meat was dry and not seasoned, the beans and rice were bland and I might as well have been chewing styrofoam instead of their corn tortillas.

Disappointing meal.  Being that the temperatures were still in the high 90's and humidity just choking me all throughout the day, a complaint at that point seemed futile.

Certainly glad to be back home in California where real Mexican food is just a stones throw away.

My rating would have been a negative 1 had it not been for the well mannered staff.

No bueno Vaqueros."}
{"text":"Been going here since the Change from Armando Brothers as that place is HORRIBLE  !! Hands down Way better now! I get the shredded beef tacos almost every morning, in fact I turned my whole office on to this place and they all go there now.

Good pricing, huge burritos, VERY friendly staff, and a willingness to substitute and flexibility to make the customer happy. If you have a couple bucks and are in the area give this place a shot. I personally love the tacos with red sauce! 

5 stars cause I do do anything halfassed"}
{"text":"This place is so sketchy in terms of the way it looks. I've only been through the drive thru, because I only feel safe staying in my car with my gun. The ordering speaker looks like the old school drive - in microphones, and they NEVER quote you your price until you arrive at the window. The food is decent, if you're prepared to reserve a toilet within 45min of eating it. Nothing special... Perfect for breakfast burritos or a fast fix"}
{"text":"This place is seriously lacking in ambiance.. I know it's a restaurant, and I should first be commenting on the food, but the inside of the place was so offensive I have to start there.... Black mold on the ceiling. Flies EVEEYWHERE. Meat sitting around at room temperature in plain view. 

My husband loves this place, so I didn't feel like pitching a fit and succumbed to eating there, seated right under the moldy ceiling. The food was okay. For a place that prides itself on carne asada, it was absolutely standard run of the mill Mexican dive food. The one perk, the portions are huge. But it's not like you actually have the desire to eat all that mediocre food. 

The service: probably passable if you speak Spanish. If you don't... Well be prepared for your order to be wrong. I won't go back here. It was disgusting. But I'm sure there are a couple loyal followers that will keep the nasty place open."}
{"text":"This was my first time in. I was in the mood for a burrito from a \"Mom and Pop\" spot, no Chipotle today. I live near this place and I have yet to try it out. Today I took a chance and it was just okay overall, but I'm sure I will go back and give them another try. 

1. The environment is cool and it has a Mom and Pop feel. The customer service was good and I didn't have to wait long for my food. 

2. The Carne Asada Burrito I got was the size of my forearm. After I added Rice, Beans, Cheese, and Sour Cream. I'm from Oakland where we have excellent Mexican Food and the Best Burrito Trucks in the world so it's weird to me to have to add those things to a Burrito, but in Arizona that's the culture. 

3. The Burrito wasn't rolled as tight as I like, and the taste of everything together once I mixed it a little with a fork was pretty good. I would recommend it to anyone that wanted a quick burrito to eat for lunch and have some left over for dinner. 

The next time in I think I'm gonna try a Carne Asada Torta. That's something I have yet to see a place fumble on."}
{"text":"I have no complaints.  We went in drive thru, order was efficient and friendly.  Cabeza was moist and flavorful, even on the greesy side.  Menudo was done right, everyone was happy."}
{"text":"Huge juicy portions just like I like it!!!! Carne is fantastic burritos are still huge unlike ALOT of other local restraints and the guacamole is delicious! Cheap, quick DELICIOUS eats I always stop when in Phoenix"}
{"text":"My nephew told me someone had recommended this place and said they had Bomb Mexican food. I try to not judge restaurant by their cover but man, this place is tough to not do that too... We drove into a makeshift parking lot and wondered where we order??? We found a tiny window that was closed. I knocked on it 3 times honestly hoping no one would come out. After a minute the window slides open and this lady popped her head out. It was pretty weird, but anyway... She spoke Spanish only and luckily so did I. we ordered our food, 2 California burritos and we each had to try a carne asada mini taco. After waiting about 15 minutes outside in the heat the window slides open and out comes our bag. the food was mediocre overall... it needed flavor. The salsa was pretty dang good though. I now know to just keep on driving by next time, and my search for bomb Mexican food continues."}
{"text":"Lousy service. Messed my order for the 4th time now. This place sucks bad, they used to be good."}
{"text":"Food was greasy. Order was wrong. Debit machine wasnt working. Did nothing to help correct order. I didnt even get utensils."}
{"text":"Worst food Ever! Food used to be okay now it has went to crap. I'd rather spend my money at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"The value for the money is worth the visit, its cheap, really cheap compared to the sheer amount of food you get in their burritos, but its some greasy food, u best be in the mood for it, it leaks from the bottom by the hand full, buuuuut some people actually like that, like me!"}
