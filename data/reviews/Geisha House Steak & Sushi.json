{"text":"This place is amazing great service and \"BEST\" quality of foods. I do not usually give five stars but this place is amazing.  DEFINITELY come here if you are looking for entertainment + quality."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is Top Notch Beautiful! Sushi Rolls and Food is one of the best and freshest in town! The only down side was a select few waiters/ waitresses did not have the time of day for us after our orders were taken.. Plus its awkward when another waiter has to check up on your table.. If your not at the Bar or Hibachi I would go somewhere. Great Food Overall."}
{"text":"Ok, so, this is a bar review, as I have had very little experience with the food (not much is vegetarian; the vegetable tempura udon is great, but I cannot speak to any other dishes). 

If you happen into the bar when, look for a guy named Dante, and ask him to make you a drink - you won't be disappointed. He has made me dozens of unique creations, every one absolutely delicious and just the right booze-to-other ratio. That alone has been worth the 4 stars, without question."}
{"text":"I had to walk out because there was only one cook tonight. There were two tables not being tended too! Ridiculous. I went to it because it was local and I wanted to support it instead of Benihana. Bad choice."}
{"text":"It was great experiece:) It was much much better than what I thought of it!! I am sure that you guys would be surprise w/Geisha house!!! Just one word!! No wonder!! It is Geisha house"}
{"text":"Good food, but don't buy a Gift Card there. They have pehistoric book records with an electronic credit card. I was given one as a gift and when used they tell me a paper sticker showing the amount of the card is required. No instructions, no system, no gift. They should not be allowed to continue this racket."}
{"text":"I have never ate here before during their normal menu hours. I have been to the one on DI when they were open but this is my first time at the new location. 

This review is for the groupon purchase of the -Naked Sushi Event- only.

When you purchase the groupon a reservation is required. They only hold this even on specific days out of the month and it starts very late. Our reservation was for Oct 22, 2011 at 10:30. 

Once inside you HAD to pay a mandatory $5 gratuity which was not stated any where on the groupon that right there already pissed me off. You were also handed a drink coupon as mentioned in the groupon. 

Food:
 set up around 1 hibachi table buffet style and you just go around and help yourself. 

Two models taking turns lying on the table wearing pasty flowers and nude panties with banana leaves covering the appropriate areas. They did have sushi laid on the leaves, but you were not permitted to eat the pieces of sushi off the model. 

-Sushi: the night started off well with a semi large variety. California rolls, nigiri (salmon, tuna, yellow tail, shrimp)  I think they made the rice portion a little larger than normal. They had some specialty rolls like spider rolls and 2 concoctions that I don't know the name of but were pretty tasty, and spicy tuna rolls. I was able to make about 2 rounds with a pretty decent selection. At round 3 all the nigiri was gone and everything was replaced with California rolls and maybe one plate of spicy tuna. 

-Sides: EVERYTHING they had as a side that was supposed to be hot was COLD!!!!! gyoza was not crunchy even when I got there just a little after I saw it come out of the kitchen. I didn't try the egg rolls, the shrimp tempura was starting to get a little soggy and was just barely a little past warm. Chicken skewers were awful COLD and dry. They also had a beef side that also was not favorable. 

-Fried rice: was made fresh. The rice I will have to say tasted like butter. It was so oily and I just felt like I was gaining a pound every time I took a bite. That didn't help the flavor either. I know you need a little bit of fat to make stuff taste good but that was gross. The chef tried to give me a whole scoop but I told him right away to give me 1/2 of that because 1. I didn't want to waste it and 2. you don't want to get full off of rice. 

- DJ was pretty impressive. Had a good mix going on the whole night. 

- Service:
No one comes by your table to explain this to you or to let you know that there will not be waiter service. We had to ask the hostess after she was done sitting another party where our waiter was. she explained that if we needed any beverages we would have to go to the bar. 

WATER! don't expect to you get any water during your meal at this event. We went to the bar and asked for water and was told that they were not permitted to give out regular water and they for the night they were only serving bottle water that they were CHARGING you for. If you didn't want to pay for the bottled water you could use your drink coupon for it instead. WTF!! who doesn't serve water at a restaurant?!! They were actually refusing us water. 


expect a busser that constantly cleared the table. when I say clear I mean he took: the chop sticks, soy sauce dish, and your wasabi/ginger dish. so every time you came back to your table you had to start all over.

I would not recommend going to this event."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was even better! Our service was very kind and funny. Also my son was able to leave with a good luck gift. =)"}
{"text":"Only reason reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the chef (which gave excellent customer service) made up for the HORRIBLE service we experienced for my sisters 21st bday dinner. Our server was very rude no smile at all made us feel like we were bothering him the entire time. Could definitely feel like he did not want to set our party.  Had to ask for refills more than once and still charged a gratuity of over $70 which he did not deserve at all. Asked to speak to a manger there was not one available stated the employee which I'm guessing was the bartender that helped us more than our actual server. She was even the one to drop the check and cash us out. Thank god the chef was awesome and somewhat made up for this horrible experience. Next time I will make sure that man is not our server."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and it just seems to get worse each time. We were there tonight with a party of 4. The food was terrible. All the vegetables were overcooked. We barely finished eating and were finishing our $18.50 drinks when the hostess approached to inform us, and the other party at the same hibatchi grill as us, that we had to leave because she had other reservations and her other tables were broken. Seriously. Terrible food and half finished drinks and we were asked to leave (along with the rest of the table). One star is too many."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I am however a big eater and I don't think I can afford to order enough food to get full at this place which is typical of any Japanese place for me. I spent $20 on lunch and it probably would have cost me another $20 to be full."}
{"text":"All was terrible but the food! Bad service, dirty restaurant, sticky counters, taped up menus, dirty bar glasses over flowing in to my counter space. The only positive was a couple rolls we had and the older, Asian sushi cook behind the bar, he was actually the only friendly attentive employee in the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"Highly recommended!! I went to Prime steakhouse in Bellagio and had $80 fillet mignon and I thought Geisha's fillet was much better. 
Employees were very helpful and kind. 
If you are looking for a cozy and tasty dinner with family, this is the right place."}
{"text":"Again another awesome dinner by Chef Jeff! Our little guy enjoyed himself again! It was a surprise dinner for him."}
{"text":"Had our son's annual birthday dinner here. Four of us of split a Japanese lasagna and rocky mountain sushi roll. Then ordered two geisha specials which was more than an enough food for all of us. The chef was entertaining and the staff was quick to serve us. For the amount of food the price was spot on. Can't wait to return. Thanks Jorge \"The Mexican Ninja!\""}
{"text":"Geisha special!!! Best fried rice in the world!!! One of my favorite places to eat! Great service, great food! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Long wait with no crowd as excuse -1
Great P.I.M.P roll +2
Inexperienced wait team 0 
(can't blame them, manager!)
Solid hibachi +2

Worth another try!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I understand that it was the opening of the restaurant. But you have to be kidding me. Waited hour for a Service and nothing. Such a shame. At least the drinks were good. Bartenders were amazing. The waitresses need some more training. Never again."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere! What can I say? Everything was just great including the drinks that had smoke coming out of them.. LOL the service was great and we would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go and relax on a Friday. Their Bento boxes are amazing. Service is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant!  Food is pretty good.  Though I only give them four stars because they make us feel rushed.  Plus, one time I did find a bug in the sauce that they served.  It was alive and I understand that could just be a fluke.  Anytime you have a Geisha experience is it all based on how good of a chef you have.  If they are in to the experience and want to make it fun or if you are the 10th table of the day on their fifth work day.  It is affordable and always a nice place but not a home run!"}
{"text":"Geisha House is great, the price is great for as much food as you get. We always have the teppanyaki dinner, the show is either ok or really good depending on who is your chef. We've been here so many times that it doesn't really matter. We enjoy the funny banter between us and the chef. The watermelon(?) butter is delicious and turns all the food red. Very cool.

Call ahead to make a reservation so you don't have to wait. Also, try the flavored sake!! I am not a fan of regular sake but I loved the flavored versions!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch with the family and had the place all to ourselves. Food was awesome and Trevor and the staff were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Lately we have been on a quest to find a mind blowing teppanyaki experience. I haven't quite found it yet, but I would say Geisha came the closest. The teppan chefs are quite talented and do a little more than some other places I have been to. The food is excellent, especially the Geisha fried rice. This place has a great ambiance for taking someone out on a nice dinner date, or just for hanging out. A must for any local in the North Vegas area!"}
{"text":"Not only does this place have such nice employees, the food was absolutely mouth-watering! Chef Eddie, who you should definitely ask for, did really cool tricks while cooking and he made our dinner very fun~ The fried rice and steak was delicious^^! I recommend this place to anyone who loves food & a show in one~^^!"}
{"text":"One of the best teppanyaki places I've been to ever, and I've lived in Japan. 

The place is nestled away in the back corner of a rundown looking strip mall which set us a bit wary, they have been there for a long time, and over the years the area has slowly deteriorated, but the inside is a completely different story. The accomidations are nice and the people are friendly, everything is clean and lit nicely. 

Prices are somewhat expensive (a bottle of sayuri nigori sake which goes for around $12 at many Japanese restaurants is $17 here) but their portion sizes are large, their skill great, quality of food awesome, and taste is delicious. Between everything the chef cooked, he would wipe down and clean the griddle which was great not only to preserve the quality of the taste but because it speaks to their standards as well. 

Bottom line? I would definately return in the future. Everything gets 5 stars except for atmosphere. The place is pretty small and sound echoes loudly, as a result if a chef is cooking nearby (we were in the middle table so they were always nearby) you can't have a conversation with anyone but the person next to you, and you have to yell at eachother to do so."}
{"text":"Frances seated us..service was great! Our chef Edward..awesome!! Friendly and I will definitely be back! Edwards food was amazing! Place was very clean. Staff was very attentive! Like I said amazing experience! Plum sake...must try!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Geisha House after hearing wonderful things. I was not too impressed, and I'm easy to please! I had veggie tempura, eggrolls and chicken teriyaki. The service itself was excellent and very attentive on a slow Sunday night. The veggie tempura came out with shrimp in it though... I guess there was some kind of mix up. I didn't bother making a fuss of it since the veggie pieces were good. The dipping sauce was too salty though, and I ended up using their soy sauce which was somehow less salty! The eggrolls were more like chicken pepper taquitos. Very peppery and very crunchy, not delicate at all. The chicken teriyaki was fine. It was cooked okay, but bland. Despite the friendly staff, the food definitely needs improvement."}
{"text":"Service was decent, but unfortunately food was very bland.  Chicken was very dry and I was not impressed with their rice.  However, their sweet ginger sauce was very good.  Their dragon roll was also very enjoyable.  Lobster was too chewy. 

Our chef was a really nice guy. Very considerate. Overall, I giving it 2 stars because for the price of the main dish, food was not up to par for me."}
{"text":"Always a great time when my family and I come here. Devi is the best waitress! She is always on point and takes great care of us!!"}
{"text":"First time dining here & it was amazingly good! Chef Jeff was very good & entertaining! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"3rd Time in a row... we were RUSHED! (NW Decatur) started by trying to serve us with people already with there soup and salad. Then we finally got sat at the hibachi table, our order for sushi was taken... 1/2 of it was brought to us as the Table Chef arrived (Nigiri) the second 1/2 was brought as the final vegetable items had been put on our plates as he pushed the completed meal toward us...  Did I mention they \"FORGOT\" to bring our soup and salad!!!!
It finished with them again forgetting to ask us for our included ice cream desert. Hey I bitched and got a whopping 10% off...  
Lastly I'd like to say prior to this 3rd incident, we have been patrons of this place for the last 5 years....  what a loss to them as we will NEVER return to this location!"}
{"text":"The best tempenyaki/hibachi restaurant around. I have been to several different ones, but none can compare to geisha steak house. The service is always on point and the food never disappoints! The shrimp is to die for. And the steak is very juicy."}
{"text":"This is the best hibachi (teppanyaki) in town, much better than the hibachi restaurants I have tried on the strip. Friendly and efficient service. The dinner was entertaining but most importantly the food was excellent. Fried rice was phenomenal. Ingredients were fresh and high quality.  We ordered filet mignon and lobster, both were cooked to perfection. 
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love this place! Beautiful atmosphere and delicious food. Great happy hour and super friendly staff. Mark was amazing and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff here has made this our go to sushi spot! The food is equal to the service and the atmosphere is amazing with the huge tv/movie style screen on the wall and lively ambience. Loved everything about it...ESPECIALLY the lobster martini!"}
{"text":"I came in with my fiance. I had filet and lobster it was tasty. She had shrimp and filet it was delicious. The service was great. I will def come back again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!
I originally made reservations for 6 for a birthday dinner. I had also bought an ice cream birthday cake and dropped it off earlier that day to surprise the birthday girl after dinner. My party arrived and we were seated for dinner. Salads, soups then appetizers arrived without a problem then it happened...While the chef was cooking the rice on the grill we all noticed a drip from the above hood onto the grill. I immediately brought this to the attention of the chef. He then nonchalantly slid the rice over to the other side of the grill. He called a coworker over that literally climbed up on something and proceeded to put a dinner napkin in the area where the drip was coming from. After that I asked for the manager. He came over apologized and said,\"we had our hoods cleaned earlier today so thats why it was dripping. WOW, I feel bad for anyone before us that didn't notice the drip and possibly had debris drip in their food. I told him whatever was dripping could possibly be in our food and that I didn't want anything from that grill. He then moved us to another grill and offered us appetizers, yeah thats equivalent to us eating contaminated food from whatever was dripping down onto our grill. So we moved to another grill and the chef continued to cook, this time without a dripping hood. As our plates became clean I couldn't help but wonder if/when they were going to bring out the cake(which was the birthday girls favorite) that I had dropped off hours earlier to present it so we can all sing Happy Birthday. It never happened. I then mentioned to a worker standing at the bar that I had a cake and was promised earlier that they'd bring it out. He went to the kitchen came back out, contacted another coworker who also went to the kitchen and coincidentally came back out with a puzzled look on his face. I then saw the manager go to the kitchen only to come back out empty handed then asked me,\"Did you have a cake\"? Uh YEAH, I brought it hours earlier. He then took off to the kitchen and came back saying he found cake...HOORAY!! This only took about 15 minutes. By this time we were all full and couldn't possibly look at let alone eat a piece of cake. All that to say the staff at Geisha house the night of November 8, 2016 RUINED our birthday dinner. I will NEVER eat there again and will definitely pass this story on the my friends, family and colleagues."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this restaurant, but clearly this place is going down hill!!! I went out with my friend to this restaurant and was extremely disappointed. We chose \"Hibachi\" and our chef, \"Mr Personality\", was a serious buzzkill and told us about his AA meetings when we offered him a drink from a bottle we ordered. A simple no thank you will suffice, we don't need to hear about your problems... our server was pushy and rushing us, talked too fast to understand almost, the food has gone way downhill in the passed year... it's cheapened up a lot... barely any vegetables and a lot of rice, brown lettuce in the salad that was drenched with dressing... The staff was EXTREMELY RUDE. Everytime I placed my utensils down for a drink, a server rushed up to take my plate. I remember one time the server saying, \"Are you done, NOW?\", after asking me for my salad already 2 times.  We were there for an hour and a half total... much of that time we waited to be seated. After our meals, and btw, I ordered an extra meal to go so we ended up spending about $200. I was waiting on the server to bring us a glass of wine we had already paid for, so we were talking while waiting for ever for our drink, and the staff was acting like we were being an inconvenience...  We were moved to a different table (the second time we were moved during our dinner)... because apparently our server forgot about us and they wanted to use our seats and not use the OPEN GRILL... On top of the harassment of being moved, TWICE, one of the members of my party is disabled so moving is a hassle... so I'm wondering... does your company not like parties of women or what? Is that to explain the rudeness?
We noticed a very young, unpolished staff overall... very different from what we are used to
This was a place we'd go to a few times a year for sushi mostly, but NEVER again! Two professional women shouldn't be treated so poorly at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The 'watermelon' special sauce is absolutely delicious.  It may not be for everyone, but I love it.  My boyfriend and I both love it, but my mother hated it haha.  I always feel extremely satisfied with this meal...can almost never finish everything.  Soup, yummy salad, fried rice, veggies, shrimp, and meat of your choice!  I wouldn't order lobster...too small of a portion and I think being cooked on the hot top makes it rubbery.  The chicken and New York steak are great values.    The cooks are excellent and very entertaining.  The waiters and waitresses sometimes frustrate me as they speak very little English and can confuse newcomers with the explanatioins of the specials, but you can't win em all!  I visit as often as I can!"}
{"text":"The sushi is always great here. I had the muchi-muchi roll tonight and it was awesome. I try to order a new roll every time but if this was all I could eat for the rest of my life I'd be a very happy woman."}
{"text":"Fantastic food (& I'm not a sushi lover!)  Great happy hour prices! Service could have been better,  had to bus our own table (bar tender trying to tend bar and wait tables)"}
{"text":"Not a big sushi fan but at 10pm this turns into a club. Music wasn't great to me. I thinks it just a big fashion show for young people. Didn't stay long"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's favorite restaurant for all birthdays, anniversaries, or graduations is Geisha Steakhouse. At first, I didn't know why at first, but now it's clear. I'm not exactly sure if this is a franchise, but it doesn't feel like it. The restaurant is small and I recommend making reservations way in advance or you could wait an hour or more for a table. Considering there are only like six tables total, it's understandable. We always get a mix of seafood, chicken, and steak. This is the best way to go, especially for a big party. The wait staff is always friendly, and eager to pour sake down your throat. Don't be fooled by the lack of decoration, it's really not what this place is about. The food more than makes up for it. At least once, get away from all of the teppan yaki places around the strip, and try Geisha. If will hook you, or at least get you drunk.

Recommended meal: The combo dinner complete with shrimp, lobster, chicken, steak and soup/salad appetizers.

Recommended drink: I don't think you have a choice, but sake goes great with the meal.

Recommended company: Getting rowdy in this small area seems to be the norm, so a night out with friends is the way to go, not so much for the romantics."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad...the food is good(although i can do without the pink rice) service is pretty good...the only problem about this place is it's location.. The location is terrible because it is hidden in a corner where most of the strip mall is empty or theres another strip closer to the road that somewhat blocks it & i think thats why it doesn't get much business and quite frankly I'm surprised it lasted this long...."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Teppan restaurant in Las Vegas. The server & chef were both very nice considering we came 20 mins before closing time. Food is awesome! We definitely would be coming back here for more & would ask for Javi to be our chef."}
{"text":"It was dead for a Saturday night. Our waitress (Devi) sucked. Our chef was good he was super attentive and entertaining. Not a HUgE fan of the pink food dye or whatever in the garlic butter. Everything was just ok from the salad to the steak. We came from out of town but are here in Vegas quite often and like going to local spots. This won't be one we revisit"}
{"text":"I love this place great sushi! The red rock was delicious and the hulk was too. Tie the manager was very nice and funny. Juno was very nice and helpful.Staff was friendly too, me and my boyfriend will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"Met here with friends to celebrate a birthday.  Chef Jeff cooked our food and was very talented.  The wait staff was very courteous.   The food was delicious and the atmosphere was comfortable and well thought out.  We enjoyed our time and will return soon."}
{"text":"Food was great... Teppanyaki chefs really made my son trip too there enjoyful..
Only down fall.. Was their drinks sucked big time ..."}
{"text":"Great experience! Good food awesome show. Our chef John was awesome! He makes the best food! Highly recommend this restaurant if you are craving teppanyaki!"}
{"text":"The food was good I would recommend the filet was nice tender and great flavor. We also had a very nice cook named Javier wich gave us a great experience, he even cut my daughters shrimp in half for easy eating."}
{"text":"It was okay for the price I would expect much more it's very nice and cozy though I loved that they cook in front of you and the staff is very friendly just in case you go with a party of five or more they will charge you gratuity at 18% could have warned us before we gave extra tip but other than that my boyfriend liked it"}
{"text":"Good food, chef was fun and good. Otherwise awful service and bad management. They wouldn't even help us with a very minor issue. There are enough other places like this in town that I will not be revisiting."}
{"text":"I was there for valentines with my girl! And the food is amazing. Great food, good people and the Vive is good!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST teppanyaki restaurant in Las Vegas. The service was impeccable and the servers were so much fun and so friendly. This place has become my favorite restaurant by far! Try the 90% Roll and the Sake Sangria. The Geisha Special is the best deal too. So in love!!"}
{"text":"The food was not good.  The veggies were hard.  The meat was cut too big so it didn't cook right.  They added 18% tip on 5 people and when I asked about it the waitress was very rude.  Said there was a sign on the front desk.  There wasn't, it was in the menu.  I told her she should have told us that and she told me I should have looked at the sign.  Manager did nothing about it when I told him.  I would never go back there again ."}
{"text":"On of my favorite places to go for the hibachi!! the prices are great and the meat is always cooked they way i like it! the fried rice is AMAZING as well as the veggies! Great for birthdays(they embarass the c*** out of you with loud music and a train of employees) sing happy birthday and give you a sundae.  Hubby likes to go atleast once a month if not more, he just cant get enough! :D"}
{"text":"This was my favorite place till they decided to add an extra tip on my actual bill. I usually like tipping cash so it goes directly to my Waiter or Waitress. So not only did I tip them cash (generous amount) but someone from the restaurant decided to add an extra 30%. My bill was $35.26 for just 2 and someone thought by adding that extra tip wouldn't be an issue. I mean I get it. It's a restaurant and servers need to be compensated for their hard work. But it's just the principal of it. SMH...just disappointing. Beware and be cautious when trying this place out. I mean their sushi is great, love it. But I just can't trust them with my card."}
{"text":"Have to say I have had lots of sushi in my life been to many states but this place has the most flavorful sushi best atmosphere Dante ( works at the bar) is so helpful and friendly we came here on vacation and we will deff be back try the red bean ice cream"}
{"text":"Look past the strip (just West on Flamingo), and you will find this remarkable place. From  the start, the bar/lounge has amazing signature cocktails along with fun bubble fishbowl drinks. There are several teppanyaki tables with special seating for large parties. The fine dining are is situated with in the center of this large establishment while the sushi bar is filled with fresh fish, skilled and helpful chefs and a wall to wall LED screen (behind the bar). The waiting area is roomy enough for large groups and families. The selection from the sushi bar is diverse and the chefs are accommodating.  I've ate teppan on my birthday. The chef was consistent and very entertaining. The best part is their butter toast desert.  A must in my book."}
{"text":"It's always quite cold no matter what so dress a bit warm. The screaming orgasm salad is absolutely wonderful! If you're a heat fiend you can get chili edamame. Sooo delicious. Always a staple when I'm in town."}
{"text":"We've driven past Geisha House quite few times, so decided to give this restaurant a try for our anniversary and I have to say, I was pretty impressed. Wonderful service/hospitality, especially from the most hard working server, Devi (: (thank you very much Devi!!), besides how busy you were, we were in no hurry at all and definitely understand what was going on throughout the restaurant, really appreciated having you serve us, you're such a sweetheart. We truly enjoyed our first time here. Nothing but good critique, food was delicious and well presented, atmosphere was peaceful despite, it being Mother's Day/Graduation season, and decor was beautiful, definitely looking forward to our next visit!  Oh, and I do like the quick seating and open space that's a plus :D Thank you again Devi!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once before and the service was below par, but the sushi was average. This trip I decided to go back to take advantage of their happy hour, but they told us to wait 5 minutes to be seated despite having empty tables. They explained that everyone had arrived at the same time which is why we couldn't be sat at a table immediately. I was incredibly thirsty so since a quick drink was out of the question I left to find a different place."}
{"text":"Called a week out to make a reservation for 10 people on a Saturday night. Hostess told me she wasn't allowed to make reservations for groups of 10 or more without Manager confirmation. She took my info and said her manager would call me back. Two days later, after hearing nothing, I call back to double check my reservation. Guy on the phone says, \"I've never heard of that policy, consider yourself confirmed.\"  Day of reservation arrived, 7 of my 10 people have arrived. At 7:03 the hostess comes over and says that if my whole party isn't here by 7:15, they're going to cancel our reservation and put us on the waiting list. Rest of party arrives, we get seated, order drinks, and wait 30-40 minutes to receive drinks from the bar! Food was consistent with strip mall Asian food. Nothing to rave about. Very upset with this experience, as I've been there for sushi before and had excellent visits! If you can't get me a drink in less than 30 minutes, don't threaten my reservation because someone is running behind a couple minutes. Also watched the manager slamming things around in anger behind the hostess stand, keep that crap behind closed doors!"}
{"text":"If you can make it, come for the lunch specials. The Price for a Pick 3 which includes 2 Rolls and Salad, is around $11.00 and It was tasty. Also, Customer service was good. Now, I've been to a few All-You Can Eat spots which are excellent. I only gave this place 3 stars because I can get more for my money at some local favorites around Las Vegas & just as good."}
{"text":"Sooo this is my first time here and i would say this is my new favorite place to go for happy hour! Food was delicious and service was excellent. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I came here because a lot of my frens rave about it.  Its pretty far for me and dont think ill be making the trip down here again.  

Food was ok, nothing that really stood out!  Too much sauce on the tepanyakki.  The tuna roll we ordered looked brownish red.  Yuzu Yellowtail sahimi needs a better sauce on it...

Bubble wrap drink was fun but didn't have much of the bubbles part that I seen in some pics which is what got me to buy it.

For the quality its pretty expensive ..."}
{"text":"Great service. Very friendly. Great food. They cook in front of you. Great for a romantic night or birthday party or big groups. Also best leftovers ever ! Lol"}
{"text":"Came here to eat on a random day I had sushi and my gf had a salad. The sushi was great and my gf really liked her salad plus the service was very good. This location is new ans the inside of the restaurant is amazing."}
{"text":"The Geisha House has the best Happy Hour in Las Vegas if u r a fan of sushi..... Ryan is the best bartender that a person can ask for."}
{"text":"Their food was amazing and the teppanyaki chef was great, that's the good part. I'd  say they're equally as good as the place in the westgate, and the prices are comparable. Though the restaurant at westgate is far nicer, and I think they use ingredients  of a slightly higher caliber. The bad part is this, before we went, we made a reservation for 7:30 through the yelp app, when we got there  they had no idea what we were talking about and said we had to wait til 8, so we didn't get seated til about 8:05 and the server totally had an attitude, the customer service of the wait staff definitely leaves something to be desired. Our teppanyaki chef however,  was absolutely amazing, total sweetheart so no complaints there.  Next issue is that before we came, we had already looked at the menu online and picked which sushi rolls we wanted, I had my heart set on it, only to find out when we were finally seated that they don't serve sushi at the Desert inn and sandhill location :(  I really wish they'd have put that on their  website somewhere. All the food was delicious, with the sole exception of the salad, which was liquidy amd soggy. Would I go back? No, I'd  rather soend the same amount of money for better quality and a nice place / wait staff and go to Benihanas. But their food is good, I'll  give them that!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've been here twice. The first time I went was in February 2014 for my birthday. We had hibachi and our cook was very nice and funny. Everyone we encountered was pleasant.

Last night I went for the sake tasting. Albeit unorganized, I really enjoyed the event. One of my favorite sakes was the Tyku coconut.

The pourers we encountered at the first part of the event were all very friendly. After that the crowd really thinned out and we were wondering where everyone went when we saw some people walking into a room. We asked some people and they confirmed that it was the VIP area. When we went in we saw that there was already a round of food that we missed. Over the course of the event I only got a few small food items. I don't think they accounted for how many people would sign up for VIP.

Also, (and this wasn't a big deal as I had had a substantial amount of sake before this point) they ran out of sake at approximately 915pm (45 minutes before the event was supposed to end. The food stopped coming out at approximately 9pm (an hour before the event was supposed to end).

Overall, we definitely got our money's worth, but I wish there had been more food. The two people that were pouring in the VIP event were also very friendly. The male person (I'm not sure what his name was, but he seemed like the manager) was also very knowledgable about sake."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because of the good reviews, however I was disappointed. When we first arrived there was nobody waiting and only 2 tables had people at them however we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. When we finally got a seat we ordered drinks from the bar they were out of three different things we ordered. The food was not that good. My chicken was dry and the chef popped hot oil on me and burnt me. Food was definitely too pricey for the quality. The sake was good and the staff was friendly but I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great food. Attentive service. My only complaint was the long wait for our chef to arrive to the table. We had my 2 YO daughter with us, and I was shocked she was as patient as she was. In their defense, it was a Friday night & we didn't have a reservation. 

I highly recommend someone in each party ordering the Geisha Special, especially if your party would like an appetizer & is open to drinking sake. My husband ordered it with the egg roll as his appetizer. The egg roll was a large enough appetizer for 3 people! It also came with a small hot sake. Great value!"}
{"text":"LMAO THE LIES!
So there has been a strong rumor spread by the venue that they had this amazing special till a certain date. It was unlimited. Then it was limited to a few. NOW, it is limited to one.
So, I called the wrong geisha house first and asked about the details on the specials before inviting people. They did not want to help me because this geisha house is a different owner. Makes sense I guess. 
So, I finally got the right number and called this one. Yes the special is now limited to one and it was mentioned by the person who answered the phone. \"It was unlimited and they just changed it.\" 
Spreading the word about an unlimited special till the first week of August then changing it randomly. GREAT MARKETING? Hahaha. 
The first of many single stars to come perhaps. 
Time to pull together the mental notes about the food and get a second very detailed review up. 
Regardless of the specials, we still ate with an open mind.

Want an upscale Japanese meal with an amazing affordable price. Search: YONAKA!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. Delicious food! Had sushi recommended by the waiter and a crazy fishbowl drink called bubble wrap! It had dry ice and was a show in itself"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect! This was the first time my fiance had hibachi and he totally enjoyed it. The master chef totally made his birthday one to remember for him! Thanks so much!!!"}
{"text":"I have seen several Geisha House locations around town and finally decided to go into one for lunch. Big mistake. The service was bad and the food was poorly prepared. I hadn't had Japanese food that crappy in a long time. The tempura was heavily  breaded and oily. And the miso soup was tasteless with the saddest little tofu pieces. I won't be going back. Next time I will just go to Sen of Japan."}
{"text":"Normally very good for lunch but today took over an hour.  When we asked about the delay we were told that the waitress was just helping out and that the kitchen was backed up.  Find this hard to believe since it was over half empty"}
{"text":"We went here for our Anniversary, we Yelp'd it and read the reviews. I think this place is awesome, it was nice to get out of the Casinos and Casino Restaurants. The good was awesome, prices were very reasonable and it was alot of fun, yes the music was a bit loud, but we were in a party mood and it all just worked. I recommend this place, Food, drinks and Staff were very good, this place is a must and we will come back"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for teppenyaki.  Consistently good food and entertaining chefs.  The portions are big.  I typically get the scallops and my husband gets the steak.  We also get sushi here every now and then.  I think the rolls here are really good.  Some of my favorites are the salmon seeker roll and the hulk roll.  They have good sushi specials and bento boxes for lunch."}
{"text":"We have dined here 3 times now and I keep meaning to write a review but kept forgetting. Every time we have gone we had the teppanyaki(where the chef cooks right in front of you). All three times were an excellent dining experience. The staff is all friendly and attentive and the chefs were all fun and talented. Their concept weighs heavily on entertainment by the chefs so you don't realize that they fill you up on rice and veggies so you won't notice how little meat you get.  It is not to the point where you feel ripped off but I get the concept. For what you actually get food wise the price is probably a little high but you are also paying for the entertainment. Although we did not have any young children with us, there were young children at other tables and they were having a blast. I would recommend highly for an evening with friends."}
{"text":"I went to the Geisha House with my wife for a drink (or two) and was impressed with the drinks and the bartender Robert! Excellent service, at an affordable price. I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Yummmmyy! I come here all the time and the food is amazing! Service is good not great but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place has great Teppanyaki chefs. I would have given this place five stars but hearing obnoxious music along with a tambourine and happy birthday 4 times in a 2 hour period gets kinda annoying when I'm trying to have a nice date night with my husband."}
{"text":"Had children at our table so did not get the full, fun show but the food was still excellent!"}
{"text":"Very unique place really tasty service was great!! The r secret sauce was really good !! Very good hibachi restaurant ever in vegas :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to go to  they are always kind and the performance is always good and funny. I like coming and seeing Andrew as my chef. He does an acceleration job cooking our food and making fun jokes. The prices are very reasonable and you should always choose this place 5k have good food and a fun time."}
{"text":"This was a poor dinning experience my husband and I ever had. We've spent over $100 on the tab and didn't feel satisfied at all. We've order two soft shell crab appetizer (portion was small), a spicy crab roll and a spider roll (the sushi rice was dry and the spicy crab roll was tasteless, there's hardly any softshell crab in the spider roll). Along with that we each had a dinner special, my husband order the filet mignon dinner and I had the lobster dinner and they were both disappointing.  They cut up the filet mignon and lobster into small pieces. The filet mignon was fully cooked when my husband asked for rare and the 6 oz. lobster was not fresh it was rubbery. There was no flavor to the dish, that's why they provide you with two dipping sauce and it didn't help to make the dish more tasty. The fried rice and stir fried veggie was super oily. I was disappointed that this place didn't turned out as expected after reading the reviews here on Yelp, because this restuarant is so close to home we would of come back more often if it was good. The wait staff was attentive and the ambiance is nice, only if the food match up to the service. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody, don't waste your money here you'll feel unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Fish wasn't fresh at all. The gyoza we ordered was overcooked. Our fat boy roll which is supposed to come with 4 different types of fish, came with only 2 types of fish and was drenched in sauce. Service was okay but nothing outstanding. Food was just horrible and the menus they gave us were dirty."}
{"text":"We've been going to Geisha for 20 years and it's always great. Only comment I have about this location is the music choice. Rap music isn't appropriate for this particular venue. Doesn't make for a relaxing visit with friends and good food."}
{"text":"Boy what a huge disappointment. Fried rice and 'scallops' that had a pink color..... Not kidding. What makes fried rice pink? And tasteless. I would never consider returning to this place. Soup was mushroom flavored broth. Salad would've been OK if it wasn't for the large inedible chunks of lettuce 'core'. I was VERY unhappy leaving here. Never again. Scallops were irregular 'pink' pieces that had no taste and were not cooked correctly. NEVER again."}
{"text":"I love there food I usually visit the one by my house on patrick and fort apache.  It has a great happy hours and is a great place to watch games"}
{"text":"I've always gone to geisha house on flamingo and the 215 but was on this side of town and decided to try this location. It's a smaller location but man is the service on point. I sat at the bar and the bartender cody was so friendly and helpful.  He had great suggestions on the sake and even offered me a food menu. I really enjoyed myself and will Definitely have to come back and visit this location again. Thanks cody for your hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Geisha House last night with my boyfriend's family, and it was by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. Walking in, the place looks absolutely gorgeous; however don't let that fool you. 
Customer Service is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.

Reservations were made for 6:30 with the Teppanyaki Grill for my boyfriend's stepsister's birthday. 6 of the 8 people had arrived before the reservation, and my boyfriend and I were a few minutes late because we got off on the wrong exit. We got a text saying that they're all waiting because they could not be seated unless the entire party was there. I'm under the impression that a reservation means that an entire table is is RESERVED ahead of time, for a specific party, and will be prepped for the the party prior to arriving. Therefore, people can be seated at a table that is RESERVED though some may arrive a few minutes late, much like how if a friend is late for dinner, you are seated anyways and can wait for them. After arriving, we were not seated until 7 pm for our \"reservation\".

After being seated at the grill, 15 minutes went by where not a single server asked us if we wanted any drinks. The table next to us (only a few feet away) had a large party, and received attention from over 3 servers. While servers are walking back and forth around our table, we were glanced at, and others tried their hardest to avoid eye contact. After being purposely neglected, I walked up to the drink station used by the staff and asked two servers if I could place an order for drinks because we still haven't been helped yet. They asked where I was seated, and I pointed at the largest table closest to them that is in plain view their POV. The two servers ran off to find someone else, though they were in charge of bringing drinks to customers. 

Another member of our party went to go find the manager because at this point, everything is becoming ridiculous. It is now nearly an hour past our reservation, and we still haven't received any drinks, nonetheless food. Though it was a Saturday night, the restaurant was empty, and there were plenty of staff that could accommodate us. Finally, a server from the next table came to us to ask what was wrong. We said we were actively being ignored because the table next to us was receiving plenty of attention whereas ours was not. She apologized and asked what we wanted for our drinks, but the birthday girl decided that she wanted to go to the Teppanyaki grill down the street instead because if we had to wait over what is now 20 minutes for drinks, the food is going to take much longer. We all left, and found the birthday girl's father still talking to the manager. The manager barely even apologized, and seriously seemed like he didn't understand what the problem was. 

We went down the street and spent money at Sushi Tower instead. They were amazing."}
{"text":"My son's birthday is Christmas and we don't usually go out to dinner to celebrate, but we did tonight. I can tell you, I was a little hesitant because I thought the service would be a little tired and annoyed as it was 9 pm on a holiday....I could not have been more wrong thanks to JEEP!! JEEP absolutely made our night! My son couldn't stop talking about how cool our server was (called him a legend) and how this was the best birthday dinner. JEEP was so entertaining and attentive. He went above and beyond! We will be going back and making sure its on a night JEEP is there!!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service by management I ever experienced. After admitting that the staff  gave the wrong information pertaining to the usage of A Living Social certificate, the supervisor refused to redeem it for our meal. Food was definitely not worthy of anything but a coupon,"}
{"text":"We used to love this place but this is the second visit in as many months where we have been severely disappointed.  We gave them the benefit of the doubt and returned tonight, but won't be back again.  The restaurant opened at 5pm and we arrived at 5:10.  The majority of hibachi tables were full, there were 6 people at the bar; 4 having drinks, and 2 others eating.  The dining area, about 10 tables, only had one party of 4.  The hostess said she would not be able to seat us in the nearly empty restaurant for 15 - 20 minutes because she didn't want to overwhelm staff.  When we asked if we could have a table and just look at the menu, she declined at first, but then sat us.  We watched, throughout our meal, customers being told they had to wait.  After about 25 minutes, the 4 people at the bar were escorted to a hibachi table, and that just left the two that were eating, and it became apparent that they knew one of the sushi chefs.  One young couple who asked to sit in the dining area and were told to wait, asked if they could sit at the bar and the hostess directed them to \"sit here\", directly next to the other two that were currently eating - there were 12 other seats available at the bar. When we finally placed our order, 3 bowls of miso soup, 4 orders of sashimi, one sushi roll, and one order of shrimp and vegetable tempura, the tempura came out with shrimp only.  The sushi roll and sashimi came out next, but we were told the miso soup was delayed because it was \"warming up\".  (I'm not sure how they managed to give the 2 hibachi tables soup, because they all had it).  When it finally did arrive at the end of the meal, it was luke-warm at best.  
They will not have the opportunity to ruin a third meal for my family because we will not be back."}
{"text":"amazing!

I have eaten at geisha on my friend Robs recommendation.  I love this place... Rob was able to get me a table in a private dining area... I will most definitely use Rob at Geisha for my upcoming events... The place is clean! the food is AMAZING and the Exec Chef Vincent Makes this Geisha the most delicious experience!!!

NOW THE FOOD
WOW!! 
the pork belly skewers!!
the Beef short Ribs...
the Sushi..
Even the sliders.. A 10 on everything!! and I am SO picky!!
Geisha does it right   and If you are booking a party.. Robert is the guy to see!! He is the most accommodating and made sure everything was perfect.. I appreciate you!!
keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy place on the north side. Servers were attentive and engaged. Many different sushi options and various availability for those non-seafood eaters. Overall good experience and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out the happy hour menu.  The sign advertising the happy hour says \"All Day. Every Day. 4-9.\" So we thought that was comedic & decided to pop in to have a drink (since it was 8:20...40 mins left to take advantage of all day happy hour!)

Decided on the sake sangria and it is AWESOME. Very ginger-y. I would definitely order it again. We'll come back for the happy hour sushi, too. The bar/outdoor patio is lovely, and perfect for when the sun goes down. This would be a great venue for birthday parties, rehearsal dinners, etc. Also recently learned that they were rented out for a private wedding ceremony for a local celebrity & they were married AT Geisha house. Neat! 

Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very good, took my family here and we all came out very satisfied.

The tempura rolls are very very good, and so was the spicy tuna. I would definitely come back to this place next time I visit LV.

The staff was very nice and very courteous, you can't go wrong with this spot."}
{"text":"right when i walked in, i found that they did not do much with decorating the place or at least try to cover all those typical shopping center windows.  The bar area was mediocre and did not have enough room for more than 6 people.  i was impressed that they did have nigori or \"unfiltered\" sake, which is so good and sweet when drank cold.   The teppanyaki area also was decorated poorly.  Our chef was very entertaining (chopping, smacking, lighting things on fire,cracking eggs,etc right before our eyes), but the Geisha Special was so unimpressive.  The tempura was tempura.  The chicken yakitori was chicken with a sweet glaze.  The fried rice was fried rice.  I had filet mignon, chicken, and lobster cooked in teriyaki sauce, but the flavor was nothing new to me.  The only great thing about this place is the company i was with, the unfiltered sake, and the chef that cooks in front of you.  don't get me wrong, but I really love japanese food.  I'd have to say that I probably would've enjoyed the meal more if i was drunk off my ass w/sake and somebody delivered food to me from the fast food japanese joint at the local mall.  I would give it 1 and 1/2 star, but I can't so I'm giving it a one star."}
{"text":"Eddy is amazing! It seems like every time my family chooses to go to geisha he is working.....Thank god! I've never met someone so welcoming and cool. He and the other workers are the reason why I will always be going to the Desert inn location no matter where I live in Vegas! Thank you Eddy you deserve your own restaurant"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and for good reason.  The food here is always great.  The people here treat you like family.  My wife and I had the usual chicken dinner.  This was also the first time we brought e girls, who are 5 and 3.  The kids loved chef Eddie, and he really got on their good side bringing them out some mochi.  Great time and great for bringing the kids.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This was an outstanding experience. The wait for our hibachi table was short and the service was very good. The food was good and flavorful. The chef was very nice and his cooking style a joy to watch. We will be back! The only strange thing was the way the hibachi table was set up. Not a deal breaker though."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant and have no complaints except them adding on the gratuity for my family of 6! We can't afford to take the whole family anymore since they started doing this. Other then that no complaints. My husband and I frequent this resteraunt a lot for date nights!"}
{"text":"We had Geisha House for dinner on 12/16/17 to celebrate 3 December birthday's within our party of 5. Ryan was our chef and was very engaging. He was fun and playful with everyone at the table and seems to really enjoy what he does. This as opposed to being quiet and just doing his routine, as i have seen other places. He even enjoyed a drink with me! P.S. He has a great smile too!! ;)  The food was cooked well and was excellent as always. I had more food to take home than I ended up eating. Ryan then had 3 portions of ice cream delivered to the table for us to celebrate. Was an excellent way to celebrate my 41st birthday, when I was dragged out to do so.  I've been here several dozen times in the last couple of years, but last night's experience was, by far, the best one. I will be back!! :)"}
{"text":"This our second time to the Geisha restaurant.   As before the food was prepared to perfection."}
{"text":"I'm a huge hibachi fan and recently stopped at this place because I had a groupon. It was a little on the pricey side but the portions were massive, coming with an appetizer, soup, salad, wine or saki, fried rice, veggies, and 3 kinds of meat. I ordered just shrimp instead of one of the combo meals and was very pleased as it was cooked perfectly. I wasn't a huge fan of our chef as I felt the food was under-seasoned but the rest of the service was impeccable. I had alot of fun at this location and I think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love it here, the pink sauce is great, the filet hibachi is awesome and they put on a great show"}
{"text":"I've been to Geshia House before but my latest experience with the service has left me not wanting to come back again. 

My family and I came to celebrate my birthday and made a reservation at 7:15pm. We arrived early to ensure we wouldn't miss our reservation. We were seated at 7:15 but the chef didn't arrive to our table  until 8pm. 45 minutes for our chef to come was absolutely ridiculous considering we had a reservation. The service for drinks was extremely slow as well. At one point I actually went to find a server so we could order some water. If you're going to keep us waiting at least give us our drinks so keep us somewhat busy. 

The music was also loud which made it difficult to hear other members of our party talking. The other couple who was seated with us was also getting quite frustrated with the wait.The manager came over to apologize to us and gave us a free round of sake bombs but that was it. 

Unfortunately the poor service has ruined this restaurant for me."}
{"text":"Anyone that gives this place a bad review is just stupid and probably complains daily. The service here is always amazing! From the sushi chefs to servers, to bar staff! Sushi is always good! Always! We love Geisha!!!!!"}
{"text":"Geisha House!  
My best friend Justin took me to dinner the other night to the Geisha House. We walked in with NO reservation and had to wait just a few minutes.  Not long at all really. The hostess sat us at a table with three women whom we didn't know.. But with hibachi dining there is always the opportunity to make friends! 
We ordered the Geisha Special which Includes:
Choice of Appetizer
Small Sake, House wine or Soft Drink
Soup and Salad
Hibachi Shrimp
Mushrooms, Onions, Zucchini,
Bean Sprouts and Fried rice
Entrees:
Filet Mignon, Chicken and Lobster

We started with some wine. 
Then a vegetable and shrimp tempura - delicious!

Then Joshua our hibachi chef came out and began his magic. He welcomed us and made a huge poof of flames on the grill. Then he cracked some eggs to make the rice... I actually got a picture of his flying egg and will post it later.  Then he added the eggs to the house sweet rice. Delicious and even though I watched him make it.. I still do not know everything that is in it.  
He madea darling heart out of our rice before serving it up. Thank goodness he let us eat while  he started cooking some  zuccini, mushroom and onion.   and began cooking the meat .. YUM.
We had more wine then the girls at our table drank some sake bombs.. 
the staff yelled Sake Sake
We yelled 
Bomb Bomb 
Think Irish Car Bomb only sapporo beer and shots of sake. 
This is one of the truly great meals and a must do in Vegas. If you have a hankerin for a hibachi grill this is just as good as Benihana and less expensive... 
And you can definitely make some new and interesting friends while drinking the sake bomb..."}
{"text":"Nice view with awesome food. 
Service was good. To be honest, everything was perfect. The only thing that i didn't like was....they took a bit longer time to serve than i expected.  But anyway, i had a great time."}
{"text":"We come here for almost every occasion (birthdays, graduations, etc). We love geisha house! Its so fun to have your chef cook in front of you. The sushi is very fresh as well. I always get the filet mignon hibachi dinner. The chef cooks it to the temperature I like. Its very delicious"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the last time we went, it was horrible.  We made reservations for teppanyaki and they seated us 15 minutes late, our drinks took 20 minutes to get out from the bar, and it was almost an hour after our original reservation that our chef finally made it to the table. The oddest part was that the restaurant was dead and they had no excuse for such poor time management.

They were out of cold sake, and then a server shark offered our group of girls sake bombs (acting like they would be comped) but then charged us on our bill.  The most annoying part was that out party had already ordered hot sake and beer for our table? 

The food was 3/5.  The chef asked us of he wanted our chicken cooked well-done? The fried rice is always great but the rest of the meal was sub par.

I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Love the hibachi shows. Dinner is always great. Love the ice cream flavored rice."}
{"text":"Great place to have sushi.  Went on lunch with friends.   Ordered the lunch special...soup , asparagus salad and shrimp crunch roll.  Everyone's food came out quick and it was super tasty.    The restaurant plays music but it's low so you relax and can easily have a conversation.   We like the location and the staff.  Highly recommend going here if you're craving sushi. When we were leaving,  our server invited us back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here today for lunch and sat at the sushi bar. We were both VERY impressed with the sushi!

I had a \"Secret from your husband\" roll and was BLOWN AWAY by how good it was! Super delicious, very fresh fish and just incredible. I also asked the sushi chef for a recommendation and he made a special roll for me that was also very good.

My wife had a \"Geisha\" roll and a \"Mexican Tempura\" roll and she thought it was amazing as well!

The prices were in line with your normal sushi place, 4 cut rolls were around $50. Needless to say, we will both be going back, and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for good sushi!

Thanks Yelp for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent here. I can't speak for their sushi, but the teppanyaki grill is always outstanding. Quality of food is always the same, no matter what chef you get. Drinks can be a little slow at times, but the food and performance from the chefs make up for that. The portions are large, so you never leave hungry. Overall, a very excellent dining experience. 
Favorites: NY steak, shrimp, & fried rice."}
{"text":"Really bad service, waited an hour for my food, water barely got refilled. I don't know why we had bad service while the restaurant is half empty. All entrees didn't get to the table at once and one order was messed up."}
{"text":"Who wants to be entertained by a good lookin Chef Jeff??  Me, me, me!!!  Took some friends out the other night for some hibachi table cooking and so glad we did.  We did make a reservation a couple hours ahead of time and we barely made it in.  So I definitely recommend a reservation for the cooking tables.  The rest of the place didn't look too busy.

We were seated immediately and a girl came to take our drink order.  We didn't wait too long before Chef Jeff came to our table.  At first I thought he was going to be all stuffy-good looks and all but he warmed up to us real quick.  Now I've been to many of these cooking table thingies and I just wish....wish wish wish that someone would come up with something original.  To me its so redundant....sorry to say.  The potential is GIGANTIC here.  Mark my words....someone out there will come up with some new and improved fun new tactics that will be the new upcoming trend.  The standard ole sliced onion with the fire in the hole is a bit played out.  

So why do I come?  It's still fun but the food is amazing.  We've even ordered it once without the whole show.  Its just that good.  

So your dinner comes with soup, salad, fried rice (some places charge extra) and your meat choices.  They usually serve it all up with a few different sauces on the side.  I think Chef Jeff forgot about the sauces because we already had our food when we asked.  Better late than never I guess.

I have always had super great experiences here.  One of my most favorite ones was when I was hosting my girlfriend's bday party-party of 14 when Osaka DROPPED the ball big time on my reservation.  While I was in their lobby I called Geisha....they said absolutely come in and they would make up for Osaka's stupidity!  Boy did they ever.  I think they all wanted to prove a point that they were much better than Osaka because the service and ALL of the staff was absolutely OUTSTANDING to say the least.  Quite the party recovery.  We ended the night taking a pic with all of us and most of the staff.  For this I will always be loyal!

Until next time.....which will be soon...."}
{"text":"Great food,great price and entertaining staff. Managed to get seated straight away for tapannyaki but would recommend a reservation. Good atmosphere and also do military discount at 10%."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Lychee martinis and the wings are a must but you can't really go wrong with anything you order at this standout!"}
{"text":"Went to Geisha House last night on recommendation of co-worker. This was an Excellent recommendation. Show was good by chef, maybe a little reserved compared to the others working at other tables. Maybe he was new, but still entertaining. Food, words fail, this was OUTSTANDING. We had the special, a little bit of each entree and were blown away. Compared to the really more expensive Benehana, no comparison, Geisha House wins hands down, hands up, sideways....Service was really good. When my wife's drink got to half empty, they were around several times to ask about refills, same with mine. They cleared plates quickly. Maybe too quickly, the dinner felt rushed which is why i took one star away. They brought out the soup and 2 minutes later the salad, then the chef arrived to cook before we finished the salad course. This would have been a 5 star meal if not for the rushed feeling of the dinner. Still 5 stars for the food. I don't know what the \"Playdoh\", red stuff is they cook with, but it adds alot of flavor as does the sauce for the fried rice. We had  the something-something Bomba desert, ice cream with peanut butter and chocolate, this was excellent, highly recommend. We will definitely be back--ALOT."}
{"text":"We used to go there 2-4 times a month, had amazing food! Love their lunch specials and very kid friendly. It was perfect every single time we went there. Would go there again if I ever go back to visit."}
{"text":"when I visit Las Vegas for business, which is often, I make sure I go to Geisha since they always have delicious food waiting for me. My favorite is the honey bread. 

The sweet honey and the ice cream that seeps throught the crispy bread makes it so much better. 

I always leave a space in my stomache for this dessert, after eating the pork gyoza and the lamb lollipops. 

I also enjoy the hibachi very much, since I'm not able to find a hibachi restaurant in my local neighborhoods.

 I ask for light soy sauce and oil, since I don't like it too salty or greasy, which creates the best hibachi food. I'm all around satisfied with this restaurant. 

I usually don't expect much with the service since it's not fine dining, but whenever I go, maybe because I go during slow periods, I receive the highest quality of service. I will be visting geisha again"}
{"text":"Went in and the grills weren't open yet. They told us to come back at 5 when the grill opens.  We came back at 4:45 to learn that to sit at the grill required a reservation and everything was already reserved.  The same girl that told us to come back in an hour was standing there.  We won't go back"}
{"text":"Good food but would not rate it 5 stars for the money. Fun place..waiter was funny and energetic."}
{"text":"Had great time last night! New Geisha House at this location has beautiful atmosphere, friendly staffs, and delicious food as always!!!  Great job Geisha Family!!!"}
{"text":"Went in with high hopes, was disappointed, to be fair I usually go to a spot on paradise and I guess I spoiled myself.

The pink sauce goes on EVERYTHING, it is not very flavor full and I thought maybe it only goes on the rice as a gimmick to make it pink. When I blinked it was in my lobster (which was already out of its tail and looked defrosted) and on my shrimp, I told him to please not put it on my steak.

Was not impressed at all. It was Friday night and there were barley any people here."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place due to a deal on Groupon (which, turns out wasn't for this location, but the one on Ft. Apache, which, by the way, is no longer \"Geisha House\". We didn't find out the error until it was time to pay. We'd told the host upon arriving that we had a Groupon so either this location was running it's on Groupon deal or the host didn't understand what I was saying. Anyway...). The teppanyaki tables were taken so we  were seated in the dining area. 

The decor is stunning. Elegant yet hip. Comparable to any Strip restaurant. Dark and intimate, even though it's a large place. Our waitress was super nice and made some great recommendations.

I started with a lychee martini. It was a little on the sweet side but good. I think it could have used a fresh lychee or two.

We ordered the Japanese Hot Rocks for an appetizer. This is a cook-it-yourself dish and was quite tasty. The strip loin medallions are very thinly sliced. You dip them in the accompanying sesame sauce then throw them on the hot rocks and let them cook for a few seconds on each side. Nice, light start to a meal. 

We shared (as recommended by our waitress) the Geisha Special. The special came with soup and salad. The salad was fine, the soup was flavorful and good. We went with the egg rolls to start and they were delicious. Crunchy exterior wrapped around yummy goodness. The steak was perfectly cooked and the rice was colorful, sweet and savory. A ton of food but very good.

For dessert, we ordered the green tea creme brulee with red bean ice cream. The custard was FANTASTIC! Its base was perfectly silky and generously infused with green tea. It wasn't too sweet so it balanced well with the crispy sugary top. The red bean ice cream was very creamy but I thought it was bland. I'm not familiar with red bean ice cream so I don't have much to compare it to. I know Japanese desserts tend not to be as sweet as their American counterparts so maybe this is what it's supposed to taste like. Either way, I thought the ice cream was bland. 

The dishes, from start to finish, were beautifully executed and presented. I've tried several teppanyaki places in Summerlin (Hoikaddo, Ohjah, the place that used to be Geisha House on Ft Apache and is now something else) and this is my favorite."}
{"text":"Just left the location on Flamingo and one of the worst experiences at a restaurant. Food was ok but the SERVICE was AWFUL and I work in the service industry, as a server! I have been there a couple times before and it just kepts getting worse. On previous visits me and my fiancé have always felt rushed so this time I asked the server before we ordered if he could make sure to space out the meal so we didn't get the everything at once. We both ordered the geisha special which comes with soup, salad, an shrimp appetizer and then we ordered drinks and extra appetizers on top of that. The soup, salad, and shrimp appetizer came out at once and we still had not gotten the drinks we ordered. Finally the drink came and before I could even pour my beer the additional appetizers we ordered came, along with the meal!I understand wanting to turn a table but this was ridiculous especially after we had asked for it to be spaced out. The server who had disappeared finally came over and I explained that we had just gotten our soup salad and all appetizers and had asked for the main meal to come later. He took the meals away. With a new baby going out to dinner is are only time to talk so we don't like to just scarf down are food. My fiancé let the server know if they wanted to start the meals that would be fine since we were almost done with the appetizers. 30 seconds later he came out of the back with food. Umm that was a little to quick. The plates were hot but the food was cold, it was the exact same food. Are dinner, which was not cheap by any means, had just been taken to the back and put under a heat lamp! I ask to speak to a manager. The \"manager\" that came over looked like he was 19 and obviously no restaurant experience. He stated \" I have to go talk to my server I'll get back to you\". Seriously!? We were in shock with the cold meal still sitting on the table. He came back later and said he guessed they would go ahead and remake it.The server was rude and only came back to the table to drop the bill off. The meal took almost an hour to remake. By this time I was over it and didn't even want the food anymore as we needed to leave. The remade food came out still. Nor the server or the manager ever apologized for anything and nothing was taken off the bill! I get better service at applebees's when I pay $20. When you pay $200 for dinner for two you would at least expect good service!"}
{"text":"Sushi is awesome, but don't go here for Tappan Yaki they want to cram too many people in the table. Stewardess is rude and the manager didn't care."}
{"text":"Had  a fun night very trendy love the kiwilicious drink"}
{"text":"This had all the trappings of a chain carefully designed to appeal to the after work get togethers.  Having said that, my sushi roll was perfectly acceptable and I enjoyed my first cocktail, though the second I tried was more about the over-sized, dry-ice-smoking, blue-concoction than any real attempt at taste or balance.
The dessert offerings were down-right sad looking."}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant! I have never been disappointed. I have taken the fussiest of eaters here and everyone has been happy! Not a bad thing to say about it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I came here with my mother and girlfriend at around 9 and they were not too busy. The server was very attentive and upbeat. The chef did some really cool tricks and made the food so good. The owner even came and talked to us for a while, and made us feel very welcome. I believe Tai was his name (I really hope I am spelling that right). I recommend the scallops or the steak. Would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"we drove by here a few days ago and I've been to another location. Thought we would give this one a whirl. And omg it's so so so good !!!! All the food delish ! Steak perfection perfect salad perfect soup.  Now excuse me while I eat !"}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars. Just because it's busy doesn't mean you have to be rude. Thanks for a great Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"I eat hibachi at least twice a month and I have been here a few times. The food is always good and perfectly cooked. Ask for the chef Cody, he's the best in the house and you will have an amazingly good time for any event! Thanks Cody"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and it still remains as one of my favorite places to eat! The teppanyaki fried rice is my absolute favorite! I usually order the shrimp and filet mignon and am never disappointed. Service can be a bit slow sometimes, but I can handle that. The chefs \"entertainment\" while cooking can be hit or miss, but I'm more concerned about how the food tastes, and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"The service was good the food was OK. I wish we had the other chef. He was more entertaining. The tempura was good. The meats could've been seasoned more and the steak was a bit dry. I did like the place but don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"It was OK-not bad, not great. The one thing I really liked was the shrimp tempura. Also, the service was good, and I especially liked the big fire they make when cooking. However, I wouldn't return since there are better options out there."}
{"text":"Took my wonderful wife to Geisha House for Valentine's Day, and we were very impressed.  I have been to  many Japanese teppanyaki style grills over the years and this one is defiantly in my top 5.  The servers were very helpful and attentive and kept up with the flow even though they were slammed.  The chef showed up about 30 minutes after we were seated. From the time we were seated and fed we were there for about an hour and half. The food was great, but there are a lot of fillers (fried rice) since the meat portions are small and you may not get as much meat as someone else since the chef cuts all the meat portions at once and attempts to portion it out evenly, however, due to the amount of food you leave very full!  As in true teppanyaki style the chefs are very entertaining and great with children!  Overall I will definitely be back to the Geisha House!"}
{"text":"We have come here twice now.  Both times they weren't very busy, so we got right in. The food was very good.  We actually had the same cook both times, and he remembered us from the first time. I only have 4 stars because I would like some more options for combination dinners."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was great . We enjoyed sushi and chicken and rice . We would definitely come back here again and eat ."}
{"text":"Food is delish!!! Service is awesome too! We love this place, not just because of the food and service, it's cause of the ambiance too! Their 7 course dinner is the best!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today and it was awesome. Great customer service from start to finish. The Hibachi chef was incredible!"}
{"text":"I love that this place is in my backyard. Great Japanese food, if it's sushi your looking for or table cooking this place has it. It greats pretty busy around dinner time so making reservations is a good idea. My only gripe is that they don't have all you can eat sushi but quality and service is there."}
{"text":"Terrible service, a new low for any restaurant I've been to in years. Low quality fish and ingredients created flavorless sushi. Not even close to being worth their prices. We will not be going back. Maybe the non-sushi items or the hibachi tables are better, but all we ordered was sushi."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!  We were seated at the hibachi table and then wait 40 minutes for a chef to come cook our food.  Meanwhile, we only see the waiter to get our order and initial drink order, but he never comes by to check on us or offer refills.  Everyone that works there looks like they are miserable with a mad look on their faces.  As for the food, I don't know what that pink paste they put in all the food is, some sort of butter and garlic concoction, but it's disgusting.  I'm not a fan of eating pink rice or pink chicken.  We thought we'd try something new from our normal spot down the street in the Albertson's center, but we won't be back.  Disappointing from beginning to end.  Not even any offers for dessert."}
{"text":"Food was great. Steak was cooked right. Chef was entertaining. But by the time im ready to eat my food it was cold already since he cooked mine first. Rice with that pink secret sauce was good. Place has unique look. It is pricey for the portion of the food that isnt much 

The only thing i didnt like was when there were alot of empty tables yet we shared it with a couple we didnt know. We prefer privacy as we celebrated a special occasion. 

Will come back"}
{"text":"The food was amazing the portions are generous. And the ambiance was so fun. I have tried other Japanese steakhouse but this one is the best by far...."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews don't make me or break me for selecting a place to go out to. The 3.5 rating for this place and random one and two stars reviews were surprising to me even though I had not been here in years. So the wife and I have a couple errands to run and decide to his this place for dinner last Saturday 7/1. We were in early and went to the bar for a drink waiting for our hibachi table. Didn't make a res. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. They grabbed us for the table cooking and we got one each of the sea lover and land lover combos. The chef was pretty great. The food was delicious and for what we got, the bill wasn't even too bad either. LOVE the fried rice. Had some left overs to take home and they re-heated nicely. Overall we had a great time, food was wonderful, the prices aren't too crazy and the staff was pretty great. I understand different people have different expectations and experiences, bad days happen to everyone. Do your best to make the most of them! Gave it 5 to do my best to get the rating up."}
{"text":"It's meals like this that make me wish sushi was one of the 4 food groups so I could justify eating Geisha House sushi every single day!  Aside from some once in a while kitchen mess ups, this sushi is consistently so tasteful!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and the food is always excellent. You can sit in the dining room or get the show. There is also a really good sushi menu. The only negative thing I have had is when it got busy and the waitress forgot to bring out our sushi order. There is also a full bar and extensive drink menu. The teppanyaki is the highlight, so go for that."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been visiting Geisha House for a few years now.  When he finds something he likes, he will eat it 2-3 times a week!  Sometimes we sat at the bar so I could enjoy sushi while he had his steak. Sometimes we sit at the hibachi and sometimes we just take it to go.  We are ALWAYS greeted in a friendly manner even if we have to wait a few minutes for a server to come to the bar.  As bartenders, we are OK with that.  My ONLY complaint about the cooked food is this red-butter substance that they smother on everything.  Sure it tastes good....but I have issues with all of my food coming out the same color.

Back in October we became vegan-ish ;)  We REALLY started missing the GH so we decided to stop in and see what sort of meal options we could come up with.  We ordered the tofu dinner a few times.  Although it came out different each time, it was always good.  Then I had a conversation with Yoshi, one of the sushi chefs, about our new food lifestyle.  He was more than understanding and we didn't feel awkward for sitting at a sushi bar but not ordering fish.  He used everything from tempura asparagus, to sweet potatoes, to jalapenos to create some of THE BEST sushi rolls I've ever had.  Fish or NO FISH.  All of the sushi chefs there are wonderful :)

Ji, one of the managers, knows us by name now.  Whenever we call for takeout he just asks if we are having our usual (2 vegan rolls, 2 miso soups and veggie tempura).  I am SO grateful that this location is mere minutes from our home and we will continue to be regulars of the Geisha House."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say we had the 5 star treatment for our anniversary dinner. Eddie was our cook and he was very accommodating to my husbands pickiness :)
Steak well done and the rice is the best we have ever had with the fantastic secret recipe. YUMM
Francis was our waiter and he hugged me as we walked in now that is great customer service he even remembered our drink orders from our last visit.
I am very impressed and we talk about the rice all the time with the family.  This place is out of the way but the best food ever and great service."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!! Made a reservation for a party and we all show up and they have nothin in there system!! Terrible customer service to say the least never again will I come to this dump!"}
{"text":"Only bad thing is we don't live close enough to make this a regular place. Service was very good and attentive. Food was excellent. We had 2 sushi rolls. Large facility with tables, sushi bar seating and grill tables. If we are back in Vegas, this will be on our list of places to try. Note they close between 3-5."}
{"text":"Love Geisha House, always make sure to stop by when I'm in town. Similar to Benihana, but better. Great food, generous portions. Staff is friendly and attentive, prices are reasonable. Their rice is unreal, usually order double when I go in. Definitely stop in if you're looking for a hearty meal at a nice price in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is our date night regular spot. We love it here and return often as we can!
 Love the cool trucks the staff learn and always super friendly 

Our  favorite is the pink rice and we alternate on what we try each time just to change the experience! Would recommend to anyone to try this place and make it your new date night out !"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Edward was great. Everything was prompt and food was amazing. Well worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Came here earlier in the week and last night. Sat at the sushi bar. 

Ordered salmon carpaccio, salmon sashimi and a salmon seeker. All were excellent. Shared a couple bottles of sake with my buddy Steve. This sake is smooth as ice. Atmosphere is warm and welcoming. Will definitely be returning more and more."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have eaten at many different Japanese Teppan places and this is by far the best! The hibachi sits smaller groups so you don't have to wait as long as some of the bigger restaurants. The prices are really good and the food is amazing. They use a pink sauce that really gives the meat, rice and vegetables a great flavor. You also get soup and salad with the cost of your food. The chefs are pretty decent as far as preforming. We make it a point to eat here every time we come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here for a hibachi dinner with a few friends, and everything was great. The chef was entertaining and friendly, the waiters were attentive and helpful, and the food was delicious. Another thing worth mentioning is the specialty saketini cocktails - they are HUGE - definitely large enough for 2 people to share. My fiancee and I shared the \"Blue Ninja Saketini\" and it was very good, definitely worth the $18! In my opinion, however, there's nothing incredible that sets this restaurant apart from any other hibachi restaurant. Since it is a bit expensive, I would definitely return for a special occasion dinner, such as a birthday or special date night."}
{"text":"Went last night and absolutely loved my steak! Cooked perfect! Plus the fried rice was unbelievable."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday during lunch. The restaurant was practically empty with only a few people eating.

We decided on Teppan Style Cooking because it was not expensive during lunch. It was only $11-$14 per dish depending on what your ordered.

Chef Jeff was our cook. He put on a great show while making some great tasting food. He did some tricks that I have never seen before even though I been to several places like Benihana. He was very friendly and had a great sense of humor.

For the price of the food and the great show, it was a great deal. We would definitely return to this restaurant when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love the food here it is so good and all of the staff is very kind and humorous.  This my all time fave restaurant - (written by my 11 year old daughter)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here. We sat at the grill and our chef, Luis was awesome! Very friendly! He made my time there a memorable one!! Definitely coming back in the future!!"}
{"text":"Good ambience, very busy on a Friday evening. With our family of 4, they squeezed us in this small corner booth at the end of the sushi bar and next to dirty dish cart and sticky floor. It was very inconvenient and made me lose my appetite. They served us luke warm tea. The sushi was good, but I couldn't enjoy it because of how filthy our dining area was. Ironic thing was, we were the only Asian family in that restaurant while every other guest was given high priority. Not going here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing!
The theme is just right, dark with a little lighting. Its perfect. The food is fantastic & the show of making the food is so fun!

I really loved the part where they threw that fake egg at my brother! 

Maybe its expensive, but its seriously worth it!"}
{"text":"It is very good food. I was impressed with the quality of goods here. I loved the service as our waitress was super nice and seemed very happy to be there. In Vegas.. a rarity. lol.. steak was amazing.. lobster excellent.. and the chicken was good. 

The show is goofy that they put on cooking the food, but its fun. I with they had some spicy options too. It is a little to plain jane, but excellent quality! I will be back to attempt to get something spicy."}
{"text":"It was my husband and I anversity and we didn't know know where to have dinner. I found Geshia House on Yelp and decided to go there. We were staying on the strip and took a cab, at first I was wondering where was this driver taking us. When we arrived the parking lot was empty  (maybe it was because it was a Sunday night ) it made me worry the place might be close. 

We went inside and no one was eating there. I asked the host/Server were they open. He said yes and sat us down at a very beautiful table. To be honest I think they were about to close but instead we were given the absolutely  most amazing service ever. 

We had the whole resuraunat to ourselves. We both order the special, lobster, steak,chicken, and shrimp. First thing we were served was this beef both soup that blew my mind the flavor unlike any other. 

Chef Edward was charming, entertaining, and incredible talented. He made our night. Everything he cooked was mouth watering delicious. Pure perfection!!!

Half way threw our meal the server/host call the cab to  make sure our cab was there by the time dinner was done. True hospitality !! 

What a wonderful place I am so glad we went there hands down the best dinner experience of my life. Thank you Geshia House for making our anniversary the best yet!!"}
{"text":"This is the strangest and arguably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  We came into this restaurant craving Japanese dining.  I was with a blind friend (white cane, etc), a retired US Army Ranger who served 21 years.  

I have been a global business traveler for decades, as has my friend.  We have been all around the world, and between us could not come up with another story to match this.  It has been 6 weeks since then, and it still feels just as ugly as it did then.  If I was to rank restaurant experiences from worst to first out of over 2,000 such experiences, I would rank this one as the single worst.  

We were in town for a martial arts tournament.  We stepped in and were greeted coldly by the \"host\", which seemed very odd as we were kind, quiet and polite.  We were well dressed and ... again, my friend is clearly blind.

It was 6:20pm on a weekday.  They asked us to wait.  I looked around the restaurant.  There were a total of two tables with customers seated.  The entire rest of the place was empty.  We stood there, feeling awkward about this for over 20 minutes.  It was beyond strange.

We were literally ignored as the hosts walked right by and completely avoided us repeatedly.  We were the only ones there, so rather hard to ignore unless intentional.  It clearly felt like they had decided not to serve us.  It seemed to be their thinking that if they could avoid seating us, then they would avoid serving us, and if they avoided acknowledging our existence further, they could avoid seating us.  

I whispered to my friend in jest after 15+ minutes that perhaps they do not serve people of his ethnicity.  After a few more minutes, we uneasily realized that this may actually be the case, and that there was some kind of very strange behavior going on here.  We are at a loss to explain it any other way.  We had kindly inquired as to availability of seating twice now and were literally ignored as though we were fish in a tank they were passing by.  

We finally left in disgust, walked across the street and had a very nice Chinese meal.  Looking back at it, it is hard for me to grok that it really did happen this way, but indeed it did.

."}
{"text":"Had an expired Groupon but thought I'd use the value towards lunch so boyfriend & I decided to come in during lunchtime. I was definitely confused on where the place was. The sign says Kanji Steakhouse, not Geisha House Steak & Sushi so be forewarned.

We thought it would be busy but it wasn't at all inside. It seemed like they just opened but looking at their hours, they had been open for over 2 hours already. We were seated right away. The restaurant is just a big open space. Thought the interior was beautiful, pretty unique tables and benches.

Ordered the Rib Eye Entree and the Combo Filet Mignon & Shrimp. They come with soup, salad and fried rice but OH MY OH MY, why so pricey? Lunch Specials did not apply to the Groupon; I wish it did. But no complaints there. Food was pretty tasty, generous portions. I just have had better, that's all."}
{"text":"On June 29th, I saw a \"deal\" on Living Social for this restaurant located at 9719 W. Flamingo Road. I read the details to my husband and we decided to buy it. I called yesterday (July 13) around 12 pm to place my reservation for last night. The restaurant was not open yet, but I left a voice mail and my call & they returned around 4 pm. I told the person making the reservation about my Living Social deal and she set up a reservation for us for 7 pm. She asked for my name and phone number at that time.
 We live near the M Resort, so my husband and I left our home around 6:35 to get to the restaurant on time. We were actually quite excited for the \"experience\" we thought we were going to have. We planned on trying a couple of sushi rolls in addition to details listed within the Living Social deal. 
 When we arrived, I told the hostess my name and she proceeded to tell me that the manager wasn't going to accept my Living Social deal, saying that it had already expired. I pulled up the voucher on my phone and showed her that the expiration date was September 10, 2014. She seated us (although I asked to sit at a table for 2 versus a booth for 6, but was instead seated at a half booth/half chair table) and I thought that the Living Social ordeal was solved, but the server came to the table and said the same thing. I accessed the voucher again in my phone and she only said that the manager was not going to honor the deal I purchased just 2 weeks prior. I asked to speak with the manager and we waited for a few minutes. The restaurant was not busy and I felt that we waited long enough for attention from the manager, so we left. When leaving, at the hostess station, I again made sure that the hostess verified the expiration date of our voucher and took a business card, on which I asked her to write her name on it. In all of that time, I was never approached by the manager.
 I worked in restaurants for several years in my late teens and twenties. My husband and I eat out at least twice a month. When we find a place we like, we always return. Our bills at restaurants are always $100 (or more) for the two of us as we always order drinks and often appetizers or desserts. We did not need a free meal (which isn't totally true because I did pay just under $50 for the deal). Besides, as I already mentioned, we would've spent another $50 at least on drinks and sushi. I have called Living Social and have received a refund. WE WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION. Although the hostess and waitress are mildly at fault (They had my phone number for a LONG time, they should have called me BEFORE we drove 25 minutes if there was a problem). This was the most extremely poor management example I have ever witnessed, and that needs to be addressed.
Let's show these jerks how Yelp Works!"}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The pink stuff is odd and on EVERYTHING. It's not a strong flavor - just a bit strange. Otherwise, service is good and everything was cooked well."}
{"text":"Went with a large group for the Happy Hour, and I can tell you, we'll be back! Although we managed to overwhelm the service staff, they stayed friendly and helpful, and everyone worked hard to make sure we all had a good time. Wide range of items on their Happy Hour menu. 

They have some nice specialty cocktails -- My preference was the Lychee Martini. Very cool and refreshing. The sushi was good, as were the stuffed mushrooms. Their garden patio area is a great place to sit back and relax, while the high top bar tables were better for moving around and socializing. The fact that the bar area opens to the garden patio gives it a nice open feel, even when crowded. One of the best parts was no over-loud music, so we could actually hear each other. 

Great place. Go."}
{"text":"Had a great time! Was really impressed! Flavor was good, Service was ok. Our Chef made the expereice happen!"}
{"text":"Ordered the new york steak and a sushi roll. The steak was decent however not cooked to how I requested and all of the side dishes were extremely over salted. As I took a bite of the sushi I could already tell it would make me sick... Well I woke up the day after and spent an hour over the toilet throwing up all of my dinner from the night before. I will not be returning to Geisha house."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I absolutely love this place. The chefs are friendly and entertaining. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is a particularly bad hostess they have named Jordan. She was far more interested in talking to her friends that came into the restaurant than helping the line of people waiting to get on the wait list. That said, the food does a lot to make up for the poor hostess."}
{"text":"awesome time! went on a weekday so not too crowded....very clean. Me the wife went with our baby girl. Good food. If you've ever been to a place like this you know exactly what to expect. Not gourmet but hits the spot.  Good time and not too expensive"}
{"text":"Second time coming in and everyone was once again very friendly. We liked our second visit more than the first time so definitely coming back soon! Hibachi is very fun and entertaining! Definitely worth the price and experience!"}
{"text":"Poor service and bland and overcooked food. The wife and i came here to try a new place and it was a miserable experience. We were seated quickly on a Monday night because there were maybe 10 tables full and this place is huge. We waited about 10 minutes before a person came to get a drink and food order; No recommendations or pleasantries from the server. The menu is tiny compared to most sushi places so we picked a few rolls, edamame, veggie tempura, and a chef favorite chicken dish. The prices were decent. When the food arrived we tried everything and were disappointed with all but the edamame. The rolls lacked flavor and the chicken was way overcooked. Definitely not going back again. Not sure why there are such high reviews on this place...at least the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Happy hour prices PLUS a Groupon discount? I'm there!
Swanky interior, friendly service, and a diverse menu: hibachi and sushi items available, in addition to tapas. This place almost has too much going on. Even the layout has patio, bar and lounge seating, plus gigantic booths, hibachi grill table seating, the sushi bar, and a pit of \"regular\" tables too.

Ordered exclusively from the HH menu: spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls were surprisingly large, yellowtail carpaccio was a small portion of thin-cut fish with nearly no flavor whatsoever- overpriced even with the discount, baked mussels were tasty, but the wagyu sliders and stuffed mushrooms were the stars. Considering their marketing, I'm not sure it's surprising that their most Americanized options were the ones that actually seemed to have more effort put into them but YMMV.

Did not have the lackluster service others have mentioned- our server was polite and despite having the entire bar area to herself, she was mostly attentive. Would suggest the hostess ask patrons upon entering if they are there for HH, as the pricing is only available in certain seating areas and it was awkard to have to move- other reviews have mentioned this as well."}
{"text":"Food is great. I like the sundial or sun something sushi (it has a thinly sliced jalepeno on top). Had really confusing service one time (I swear all the servers were confused as heck regarding where they themselves sat us, tables, bar, or hibachi) but the manager was very nice and trying to be helpful about it. If I go again I think it will be during lunch where I'll sit at a table and get sushi without any seating confusion."}
{"text":"The food was the best part of my first experience at Geisha House, and the only reason for the two stars.  

The waiter got into a minor tiff with me over some wording/phrasing on their menu. There were also two major mistakes with the orders in our small group, along with a very slow dining experience. 

We also checked in and they did not honor the check in offer! Not sure I'll ever come back."}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Food has never disappointed! Would be 5 stars if the front desk girl wasn't so rude, a smile wouldn't hurt!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went for his early Valentine's Day treat - dinner service at teppanyaki. Reservations were made for 6PM, but we had to wait for an earlier dinner to wrap up. No biggie 'cause the hostesses were nice, and the bartenders and drinks were good while we waited. 
We ordered the scallops dinner for myself and shrimp dinner for the boyfriend. The chef was nice, and the other people that joined for the dinner service at the same cooking top were cool. We didn't converse with them much though 'cause we were in our own little cliques and celebrating different things. It was cool to see the chef focus on the little kids and their parents, and a kid that just turned 21 with his friends or family. Point being that service for the most part was good. 
The only thing I really have to say is that there was a transition of servers that was slightly weird. The original server we had was MIA, and another had to mediate a situation when we didn't receive an order of sushi that was supposed to be our starter. 
The food was good. LOL. I would've finished it had I not drank so much."}
{"text":"Rating this based on our server that was completely rude to us. Chef was on the other hand, friendly and Attentive. Sucks we had to experience this type of service here..."}
{"text":"The food was great! But the service was horrible! we are still sitting at the table waiting for the waiter to get our cards. They had to confirm with us 3 times what each of us had ordered.   The staff appears to be confused and also unapologetic that they are taking so long. There was also an automatic 18% gratuity. Would not have chosen that. This food is not worth the trouble!"}
{"text":"This place is a well kept secret for sushi!!  We are regulars here and Justin Oh has become our favorite sushi chef here in Vegas without a doubt.  I think Justin's rolls are the best!  When you go there, ask for Justin to serve you at the sushi bar, tell him Joe sent you, sit back and enjoy!!  The Hawaiian roll, aka \"Oh Roll\" is a must order, extremely tasty!!  Justin is an artist when it comes to his presentation of everything he puts in front of you!!  If I could give six stars for only extremely elite places I like a lot, this is the only place I would give it too!!  Yes, they do celebrate Birthdays in a very loud and fun way, which I personally enjoy.  I think anything a restaurant can do to differentiate itself from the boring typical b-day celebration is great!!  We have taken a few friends and family to celebrate birthdays there and everyone loved it!!  Six Stars Justin!!  Well done!  A \"Diamond\" in the Northwest desert rough.......

this review was just for the sushi bar, and since Justin went back to Korea all bets are off...just an fyi"}
{"text":"Too bad, this place has memories, I've eaten here for years and their going down hill big time.   Food quality and service are lacking, sushi bar with virtually no fish."}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in you are greeted at the door by host in Geisha attire, very sweet girls, Great date night spot. Our hibachi chef (James ) was the best!! the food was great. only reason I gave the place a 4 instead  of 5 was because of the bartender,complete jerk."}
{"text":"I had a Geisha role at the bar. The service was slow for not being busy at all. The spicy tuna role & poke was good though and the bar was nice for a quiet meal."}
{"text":"Just tried out this new restaurant in my neighborhood and I was pleasantly surprised.

This restaurant is huge! The decor is modern. There's a huge LED screen behind the bar. A football game was playing. My husband and I chose a booth right across the bar because he wanted to watch the game. Oh well. :)

They have a great selection of food + sushi rolls.

The waitress (I forgot her name) came and I must say she was fantastic. She gave us good recommendations on the dishes she thought we would enjoy.  

Here's what we ordered. 

Asari miso soup (clam miso), 90% Roll (Spicy soft shell crab, tuna, baked scallops, screaming orgasmic sauce). Lamb lollipop, Green Tea Creme Brûlée with Red Bean Ice Cream

We loved all dishes! The lamb lollipop was melt in my mouth kind of tender! 

I was totally entertained by their creative menu too! Someone must be having too much sake while composing that menu. Imagine the server says,\"Here, Taste My Ex-Girlfriend and Something's Wrong\".

The owner sat down with us for a bit and he was such a sweet person! 

Winner! Will be back for more. :)"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!! We had a double date for valentines made reservations. Once there they sat us with two other couples- the most you can fit in the booths where they cook in front of you is 3 couples (6 people in total). We were 8 in total!!! I had to point out menus were not given to us for a good 10 min. Waiter said they had no more I saw some sitting at OUR table and mentioned that. Drinks were 15 min late, sake machine was broken?! Not to mention the other couples were were prudes! My husband ordered chkn skewers, they had none he asked for meat substitute Manager said NO?! Then the manager said he would give him extra meat for his entree.. I'd hardly call what he got extra! Refills were late, waiter himself said it was all unorganized.  The manager did NOTHING for us! He wore black framed glasses and is very greedy!! We stayed for the experience and we were also starving plus it was valentines - all in all food was GREAT service BAD!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for years and last Friday was our last time. It is very unfortunate to see and experience the decline of what was once our favorite place to dine. 
I miss the good ole days! Yvonne, always a smiling face ready to make your experience the best it could be. Felix was always on point and by far one of the best Chefs Geisha ever hired. Cody is still behind bar and we love him. Unfortunately,  he is not enough to bring us back. 
Today, it is unlikely you will recognize the Chefs, servers or management. I assume they don't stay long or get fired for lack of ability to provide a great experience or good food. 
When considering this establishment I recommend not waisting your time or money. At right around $40 per person for the Geisha Special ( was once my favorite ) there is many other fine dining in this town to check out and you are less likely to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Geisha is one of those teppanyaki joints like Musashi, but more on the swanky end. We decided to go tapas style.

- Crispy rice cakes
- Double D
- Wagyu sliders
- Salmon carpaccio
- Mango mochi

Wagyu sliders were surprisingly well crafted and the french fries sprinkled with shichimi was addictive. This is one fusion item done right!

Also the service was solid. Attentive and nice."}
{"text":"The hibachi here is amazing but we really come for the sushi. Great happy hour specials in the evening and for lunch. We come here once a week and always leave satisfied. The rolls are large with lots of fish and veggies so my husband and I are full after 2 to 3 rolls. Chris the head sushi chef is awesome. He always takes time to chat with us and remembered us after only coming here a couple times. We don't go to any other sushi restaurant because this place is so delicious. Can't beat the happy hour drink prices and 30% off specialty rolls along with the value of the amount of food you get. Don't forget to buy Chris a beer if you're sitting at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"A little rough around the edges this place is ....the food itself was fine...but the staff was pushy and kinda mean in a way ....really tryd to up sell you to something you didnt want in the first place....anyway i probably wont go back unless tied up and brought there...."}
{"text":"Amazing cook. Amazing service. Amazing food. If u want that hibachi fix go here. Not a big place bit that makes it like a small walk in hole in the wall kinda place."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!!  Too bad you can't post without a star.  However, please consider going here if you:
1.  Want it to take 40 minutes to get your food. 
2.  Don't care that when you look around the restaurant and see 10 other people, and management uses the excuse of \"they're busy\" as to why your food took so long. 
3.  Don't care that they tell you there is a big VIP party behind the wall and that's why your food was late. 
4.  Love being told by incompetent management that the kitchen is slow because of a VIP party, behind the wall. (You should NEVER give another paying customer that excuse. It's not MY problem. I don't want to know of any problems when I've decided to come to your restaurant as a paying customer. Run a tight ship!  I don't want to hear it!)
5.  Want to feel privileged that they are going to take a whole whopping $8 off our meal because it took sooooo long. 
6.  Want a free dessert offered by same incompetent manager, as a courtesy for taking sooooo long. This AFTER she was told TWICE we can't do dessert, because the kids have to go to bed. 
7.  Love having a wait staff that doesn't understand the importance of getting kids in and out. 

The list could go on, but my husband and I were appalled. To note, our sushi was \"stringy\" and the edamame was WAY over cooked. The Filet we ordered was for our 2 kids, which the waiter knew. No sense of urgency just TONS of idiotic excuses.  But hey, we got $8 off!  

We will not go back!  

WAY TOO MANY OTHER GREAT CHOICES FOR SUSHI IN LAS VEGAS!!!!

Sushi Fever...here we come!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE the happy hour and everyone was very friendly, from the hostess to the bar tenders. It was my first time here but I'll definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"Great hibachi grill with a talented chef named Jeff. The food was reasonably priced for hibachi. Expect about 25 dollars a person, but the food is good. The waiting staff was very attentive filling drink often. We tried one sushi roll and it looks like they don't lack in that area as well, but the menu needs a little work. I would recommend for work parties, close friends, or a date. Hope you enjoy."}
{"text":"Worst hibachi restaurant I have ever been to. Poor food quality, bad service, and over priced.  I will never return!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? So first I am in town on business so I went by myself last night and sat at the Sushi bar.  This is were immediately I was greeted by Scott & Alex. Great smiles, attentive in their service, I ordered a roll, miso soup. and a glass of plum wine. I hate going out by myself, but Scott & Alex talked with me the entire time and it made it a amazing experience.

So while the food is great, the service by Scott  in particular and Alex is why I would definately  return here."}
{"text":"We've been here several times but, this time was exceptional. Our Chef this time seasoned our food perfectly. Chef Kenny took him time on each course. We loved our experience today!"}
{"text":"This is the best teppanyaki in town and I've had them all.  I have been coming here for almost 15 years and always leave happy.  The location looks a little sketchy from the outside but it is truly a diamond in the rough.  Don't eat all day and get the Geisha special!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! They have tables of 6-7 that encircle a hot grill where the chef comes and cooks your food in front of you. The fried rice is delish! The chef will also do fire-ish tricks with the veggies and will fling his cutlery around. The table next to us was yelling 'SAKEEE BOMBB!!' 

The thing I didn't like was that the cut up your filet mignon and cook it as small pieces. I prefer my steak whole and to cut it myself..I mean, that's the whole point of steak isn't it? Besides that the food was very delicious.

The dinner menu is very limited. You pick an entree: filet mignon, new york steak, shrimp, fish..and it comes with fried rice and veggies. You get free ice cream if you check in on Facebook."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Worst service to date that I have experienced since moving to Las Vegas a year ago. I called to see if I could use my groupon at the Fort Apace Rd. location. They said yes so I went there. We ordered a few starters and three rolls. I am not sure what happened, but it took forever to get our food. The people at the sushi bar who were there after us got 3 rolls before we even got one. Of course when we get our first roll it was the wrong one. Then when we got the check, they told us that we were unable to use the groupon. I was showing them in my phone log that I had called and that the person who answered the phone said it was ok. As this is going on the server brings out another roll. Yes after the check. I told her we didn't want it and she proceeds to take our bill and add the 4th roll (that we didn't order) to the check. Thank goodness there are great sushi place with good service such as Naked Fish or Lahiana. It would actually be worth the drive to LA which has MUCH better sushi and excellent service. 
The food was pretty good, but I would never go back. I have worked in the restaurant industry and all I can say is I am appalled"}
{"text":"This place has a lot going on, large bar area, outdoor patio, Tepanyaki, sushi bar, beautiful decor & a very good happy hour! The building itself is huge & they have used the large space wisely.
On my first visit it was fairly empty & we started our happy hour early on & on my second visit it was prime time on a Fri evening and the entire place was packed. Two very different experiences based on day & time of our visits. 
The first visit was flawless, the food was great & service was impeccable. On my second visit it was a bit of a nightmare. Disorganized waitress, long waiting time for sushi, had to ask for water 3 times before I got it, one of our rolls never made its way to our table, and overall it was a chaotic experience. The food was still very delicious & it was obvious our waitress was overwhelmed. Based on both of my experiences I didn't want to focus on the negatives of the last visit and leave them a crappy review. I hope next time goes smoother because I really enjoy the space & food here."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything! My first impression was YUCK TOO SALTY!! I had a slight cold and the salt still shined through like the star of the show!! It was like the fourth inning...\"Salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, nothing but SALT!\" 

It was so unbearable that I could not even attempt to finish it, $85 later and we had \"takeout\" YIKES!!! 

I would prefer my money back at this rate, but on not even going to bother."}
{"text":"Excellent service, chefs were entertaining and fast at making all of our food. Highly recommend doing hibachi."}
{"text":"The first time soon after they opened, NOT IMPRESSED AS THEY GAVE OUR SUSHI TO THE TABLE NEXT TO US BY ACCIDENT AND SAID IT WAS ON THE HOUSE TO THEM,  but THEY LEFT US STARVING WITH THE TAB WHEN THEY GOT IT CORRECT! THAT IS SOO WRONG!

I vowed never to come here again and drive 15 minutes extra for decent sushi elsewhere.  After about 9 months later  a friend wanted to come for happy hour...it was decent sushi but SLOW!!! Almost intentionally slow. 

I am still not impressed, no matter how nice the servers are..."}
{"text":"I came in with a large family party for me nephew's birthday. Having reservations over a week in advance, we all thought we were safe here as everyone individually had been here before with generally positive reviews. 

Maybe it was because it was during the early afternoon, or perhaps someone called in sick that day. Whatever the cause was, the staff was generally confused as to what should be happening with a large party. The restaurant only assigned 1 person from the wait staff to bring in drinks, which was pretty daunting for him as he chose not to write anything down. After about 20 minutes and several mistakes, everyone had finally gotten the drinks that they had ordered. Another 20 minutes went by, and after some complaining, they finally sent the same kid around to ask us what we'd like to eat. Mind you, we were sitting at the grill and not at tables. Our orders were taken and at this point our waiter finally realized we might want round 2 on our drinks since we'd all been sitting for the better part of an hour. 

We all sat around talking and waiting, and waiting, and finally another 45 minutes had past. We were all frustrated and very hungry at this point, and the staff had pretty much just deserted us at this point. Finally, a full 90 minutes after we had placed our drink orders, the chef came out. I'm not going to bother mention the chef's name, but he's listed in several other reviews as an awesome chef. Unfortunately, he came out, apologized for having us wait so long and promptly cracked a joke about how it was his first day. Having reviewed the place on yelp beforehand and remembering his picture in several reviews, that didn't go over well. He started setting up, and just after he placed the first bowl of rice down on the grill, he realized they weren't even turned on yet. All this time, and no one bothered to turn on the grills.

We got our fourth round of drinks started while we waited for the grill to heat up, and finally some of our party had seen enough while others simply ran out of time. A few members of our group decided to leave, knowing full well that their orders were already placed. One of them mentioned the situation again to the staff on their way out, but still ended up having to pay even though they didn't get to eat anything. After another 15 minutes or so, the chef determined that the grills were hot enough, (he was working both grills for our dwindling group by himself) and got to verifying what everyone had ordered. He ended the experience by screwing up about half the orders, and though he eventually got everything cooked, pretty much no one was happy. 

The one upside that I will give to my experience here, the chef succeeded in cooking on 2 grills for what amounted to 15 people without burning anything that was given to us. Some of it was given to the wrong people, and some ingredients were mixed in the orders, but he managed to pull it off by himself. 
Second, in the enormous pass of time we were waiting for them to get their act together, I managed to get in a baked roll order. It was, I'm glad to say pretty dang good. Too bad though, the next time I'm in the mood for Japanese food, I'll save myself 10 miles and just go to Satoya instead to have better food and a better experience."}
{"text":"We dined here for Father's Day dinner and we had a lot of fun! The staff is awesome here, from the wait help to the cooks. They make it very lively and energetic. 

I've been to a couple teppanyaki restaurants. I'd have to say most are nicer than this location, but regardless, you can tell people were enjoying their meals here. Our waiter told us this Geisha was the original, and from the outside, you could tell. Plus, I was disappointed to hear they didn't offer sushi. Bummer...

It does get pretty warm at the table, especially when they start cooking. We ordered the Geisha Special and just the Filet Steak dinner for me. They were awesome too, by bringing an extra plate for my toddler son and dividing him a portion from our orders. The service was great, timely, attentive, and all smiles.

I'll be sure to visit the other Geisha Steakhouses for their sushi and happy hours, but I'll recommend to anyone who wants a very casual, upbeat fun meal to this one."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!! From management all the way down to the host.....Just plain BAD SERVICE! Now let me tell you about the food. The nigiri is overstuffed with rice and can barely make out the taste of the fish. Read this article below, I have never gotten sick from Sushi until now.

\"When sushi is handled properly in a reputable establishment by a master sushi chef, the risk of getting a food-borne illness from eating it is extremely rare. According to FDA statistics, you have a much greater chance of getting sick from eating poultry or beef than from eating raw fish. But if you eat a spoiled piece of sushi, you won't care about statistics.While you can't possibly know if the raw fish was kept adequately refrigerated or whether the server or preparer properly washed his hands before handling your food, you can use your powers of observation to discover clues that may help you prevent putting your gastrointestinal health at the mercy of a less-than-reputable sushi restaurant\" -eHow"}
{"text":"If you are having a large group or party then stay away from This place they can't handle that level of service !! We had a reserved party of 15 last weekend for my mother's Birthday, It started off well had a had a upbeat attendant Jebb who got our drinks and took our orders. we had reserved a section that as supposed to have two grills so the whole party could have the show and get the entire experience.  

Issue #1 Once it came time to start it was discovered that they forgot to turn on one of the grills so only one side of the party was going to be able to partake in the chefs cooking skills the rest only got to see the back of him.  

Issue #2 They completely messed up who had what and literally took four different people to explain and they still didn't get it right we basically just had to switch plates when the food came. 

Issue #3 They dumped the rice on the floor when they where bringing out the sides to cook. 

issue #4 Because there was only one grill, only one cook was responsible for cooking for the entire party of 15 so each side like the rice came first 10min later the veggies came and 10 min later the meat came so you basically had to eat them as they came or your plate would have been cold !

Issue #5 when the bill came we won't even go there that was a nightmare in itself for them to get it right !! 

It is unfortunate because We usually visit the other location many times for bdays and have had great service but have never been to this location with this big of party. The manager could have come over and at least apologized or did something for us given the experience that we had but all they wanted to do was basically just point fingers at each other for the issues we had experienced. Jebb was great but the others looked looked like they didn't want to even be there. I always tip and I did very well but for a bill that is more then my MORTGAGE PAYMENT I suggest large parties stay away from this location ."}
{"text":"You are putting your health at risk if you eat at this place.  Walked in and the whole place stunk! It was filthy and nothing like the pictures on the website.  The good reviews must be coming from people who are use to eating at Long John Silvers.  Actually I would feel safer eating at LJS."}
{"text":"I usually never write a review but felt compelled to for the Geisha House.  Spur of the moment a dear friend asked if I'd like to go to dinner here, he had a Livingsocial  special coupon,  a 4 course dinner for two that was $60 and included a wine,  not horrible,  shared appetizer, (chose coconut shrimp with a lemon moose),  two salads, very fresh, a shared Rib Eye steak, cooked to perfection and tender,  with creamy mashed potatoes, and we chose the house special desert, honey comb something, for an extra $5, WORTH EVERY PENNY!.  Everything was AWESOME!  I must add that the staff is extremely attentive.  Our server, Devi, that's Devil without the L, was a blast!  She turned us on to blueberry sake bombs.  There's a whole ritual that goes along with that and she is allowed to drink with us, which made it more fun.  So again I would recommend this fun eatery to everyone.  Actually going back tonight as he had 2 coupons and they expire today, oh shucks ;)  I'll let you know if it is consistent.  Bon Appetite!"}

{"text":"This is my son's favorite place for lunch!
Birthday each year & mom & son date twice a month.
The food is excellent, always! (Best fried rice)
I would give 5 stars except today!!!
About 3 weeks ago early in the morning we were walking through the court yard on way home from Walmart. As we approached a man in all black & ski mask had a sledge hammer & smashed the window right in front of me! Locked eyes with me...I'm disabled but still ran into Decatur Ave to call 911.( I cant drive due to injuries & just wanted milk!) 
Today my son finally over the trauma of it we went in. I asked the lady if the manager was in, she said not til after 4. So we told her & asked if everything turned out OK & nobody got hurt..(the windows are still boarded up.)
Not even a THANK YOU! why bother doing the right thing when the no big deal attitude as it happened b4 acc to her..I truly hoped in my mind I saved them from loosing property!! I HATE THIEVES! We could've ran off & minded our own business but that's not GOD's way & horrible karma! Wasn't looking for anything but a thank you & glad that sledge hammer didn't hit one of us in the face...I'm talking inches in front of us as he smashed the glass & had it raised up towards me.Needless to say it will be awhile b4 we return. PS: update w/ PD as it took over 10 mins on phone cuz they didn't have your correct address..Walmart, next to dickies, port a sub's was all I could get out in my panic. 
My review isn't the food, just the attitude I got.
God Bless & best of luck in the future."}

We have never had a bad experience here or at the southeast location. My husband always requests to go here for birthdays and other special occasions. Don't fear the pink rice, it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Really not a good experience. The first meal came out 20 minutes before the final meal. The manager apologized letting us know they were down help in the kitchen but still that was ridiculous. For the price the food really wasn't that great. There are a lot of good places to eat in Vegas. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I have only eaten at Japanese steakhouses twice in the past. I am not a big sushi lover, and much rather dine on Hibachi cooking. I wanted to find a place in Vegas that served awesome hibachi style food, so I came to Yelp to help me narrow it down. I saw that Geisha was VERY highly regarded, so I went there during a sunday night. I already knew from reading the reviews that the restaurant was not exactly located in what you would call a \"high end\" part of town. It is actually located at the end of a small strip mall. However I learned first hand that looks can be very deceiving. To make a long story short: This place is AWESOME! First off, the manager was as nice as could be and was legitimately interested in making sure I had a great time at his place. Second, the chef was outstanding in his skills as he prepared the meals. I sat with a couple of UNLV students who stated they came there at least once a month. Thirdly, the food was fantastic and very reasonably priced. I had the Geisha special of soup, salad, a soft drink, and the hibachi combo of lobster, shrimp, and filet. The fried rice that they make is the tastiest I have had at any of these places. I have stayed at the Las Vegas Hilton several times. They have a Benihana there, so I could have easily gone there instead of driving over to Geisha. But when I eat out the most important thing to me is the meal itself. Not the ambiance or location. I HIGHLY recommend this establishment"}
{"text":"Ok honestly I'm not one to complain, but when I'm spending a good amount of money on food and my service was absolutely awful I'm going too. Our waiter disappeared mid service, sushi was given to us more than half way through our hibachi meal(and usually you're full by then) they claimed it's because our roll was baked which was false, regardless it should not take 45 minutes to bake a roll. Also we got no salads which were included in our meal and they said it was because they were making the dressing...??? no apologies for the mistakes that were made and to top it off we were forced to give the vacant server an 18% tip. We have been to this this restaurant multiple times and tonight was just awful. I wouldn't be writing this review if we got an apology at some point in the night but the manager made it seem like the salad and sushi mistake was our fault. Not good customer service.... probably will not be returning because of this. 

On another note whoever our hibachi cook was is great! He's the only one that seemed to care about the mistakes that were made."}
{"text":"I love geisha, their tepan tables brings families together and kids are always laughing. The chefs make the whole experience wonderful. The food is pretty good and the friend rice with the ice cream ;) is delish."}
{"text":"Went there around noon two weeks ago. Besides my party of 3 there was an additional couple at the bar. The waitress was so lousy and too engaged in conversation with the couple at the bar that the sushi chefs and folks in the back were bringing us our food and apologizing for the waitress' poor ability to wait on us. Aside from that, the couple at the bar had free access to roam behind the bar, ring up their own tab and frequent the kitchen at leisure. Not sure if they are employees or friends. In any case it promotes an uncomfortable and unprofessional environment. The sushi was average at best as well."}
{"text":"Omg!! The filet melts in your mouth!!! A must try! The chefs do all these cool tricks and make funny comments which makes dining a heaven for both your mouth, eyes and ears! Very highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"this place has the best sushi!!! awesome environment!! Even though it's a sushi place there BBQ sliders are to die for! I ordered two on their happy hour!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  The Tuna Poki was very \"fishy\" tasting.  Overall food was good, however, we went in with 2 adults and 4 children.  Not one child was over 9 years old the youngest was 3 years old.  We only ordered 3 rolls, udon, a side of rice and the Poki... And we were charged an 18% gratuity ($20). I usually leave a 17% gratuity unless service is very bad.  I guess I felt it was not the best service ( cups empty, no wasabi was served had to ask for it, no spoons brought to table until I asked etc.), but I would have still left my 17% because it was not that big of a deal in comparison to some places.  I guess my main complaint is that my 3 year old was counted in the party of 6 which I think is ridiculous since not only does she eat like a mouse, but she required no service from the waiter and only used a small bowl. If you are going to count a 3 year old in the party and charge gratuity then let party know as you seat them!  Needless to say we will not return!  We will go to Sushi Loca where we have never been charged a gratuity based on our 4 young children being counted as our party of \"6!\"  Really Geisha House stop penny pinching!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! I loved the decor and ambiance of the place, very japanesey, and in the bar area are couches to lounge on! I loved everything we ordered, from the ginger sake to the goblet of bubble wrap, all the sushi, but the rice cake was just too much with the rice! Will be back again!"}

And They told me that HH is 10pm -2am &  I have Nothing more to say, but they such a FAT LIAR to your face.."}
{"text":"Always a great hibachi joint to go to. Never a wrong choice :) All of the Chefs are funny, professional, and experienced. I always leave full and happy, eager to return. The Geisha Special is my favorite choice meal. Comes with lobster, chicken, and steak. Along with rice, veggies, and the best sauces. Get ready for a fun, enjoyable experience. We probably come here once a month. More if possible :) Very clean and upscale establishment..."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and ordered the 2 special roll combo. I choose the Hulk and the Philadelphia Crunch. Also came with a choice of salad and miso soup! 

I'm not he biggest fan of cream cheese, but the Philly crunch roll was delightful. Not over powering with the c.c. These rolls are both pretty big too. I was thinking of ordering something else to fill me up, I'm glad I didn't. This did just the trick!!! There was only one chef and one server and they had a lunch rush when I came in. When everyone left, the server called me her VIP. lol. This was cute. They both had great customer service and were very attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Friendly staff and some great sushi.
I chose the J Roll. Very spicy but oh so delicious.
It's a very popular place. The tepanaki tables are a big draw especially for families.
I have had a lot of sushi in this town. Here you can tell the fish is super fresh and they pay attention to details.
Great place I strongly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our anniversary. We had a great time! The Geisha Special is totally worth the money. Our chef, Eddie, was talented and fun. The house hot sake was very good and my steak was cooked perfectly. I have no idea what is in that pink paste they put on everything, but I wish I could buy it in bulk and eat it straight! The tempura veggies were yummy and the tempura ship was outstanding!  Delicious food, great service,  friendly atmosphere. The only reason is not 5 stars is because we didn't care for the salad and the soup was just ok... but who needs those anyway when you are eating AMAZING hibachi dinner.
Side note, they overheard that my husband was military and adjusted our bill without being asked to reflect our military discount."}
{"text":"Took my sister and bro-in-law here for dinner tonight and it was great. Was the first time my sister has ever been to this kind of establishment. She had fun and we had great food. The couple that sat with us were fun to talk with as well. The Geisha Special is so delicious! This is now one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've made 3 trips to Geisha House and here are my thoughts.  The service has been excellent every time. Dinner has always been well prepared and enjoyable, (I've only ever had their hibachi style dinner). The prices are a bit on the high side for the amount of food they serve you but since we only go once a year, I don't terribly mind. Geisha House is a fun experience and I would recommend them to anyone. I would give it 4 stars, but high prices prevent me from giving them 4."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly service at VERY affordable prices!  Can't beat the lunch specials!  I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service and wait time was terrible. Watched several people walk out of the restaurant in the first 25 minutes it took for some one to a drink order. Ran out of water and had to flag a waiter down for refills even though we were sitting at the sushi bar, three different times, not to mention we also ran out of ginger and were never able to get a refill on that. The very first time we walked into this restaraunt we walked out within 10 minutes and I wish we would have never gone back."}
{"text":"One would think with semi mid prices like this the menu would be better printed and not missing letters. Food was meh service was meh. Got here a little after 930pm, they close at 1030 and tildbus we need to be done by then.... yea prob not gonna come back after this. . ."}
{"text":"This is One of my favorite restaurants in town. The food is always delicious, the service is always fantastic. The geisha special is delicious and it's a very good price for the amount of food you get. I always take visitors from out of town here and they always love it! Haven't had one bad review. The sake is delicious the cocktails are delicious and I love it here!"}
{"text":"I will start with the appearance, it was clean with a nice decor. Now the food...everything was fresh and plentiful. The cook was friendly and entertaining. Def a place to add a little entertainment to dinner.
The food was cooked with too much lemon on the seafood, it overpowered the taste of it.
The rice was cooked with garlic butter that was red. it made the rice look really weird, not tempting at all. He said it was to make it taste good and look pretty. There's Nothing pretty about red, bloody looking rice!
I knew then It wasmn't going to taste good. I think they may put food coloring in the butter cause it kinda tasted funny with an after tatse.
I don't know what ppl are eating or if they've ever had Really Good food. I have been around the globe and have had GOOOOOD food, so my taste buds are serious when it comes to good food.
This was not good food, It was decent, but not like all these 4 & 5 star reviews say."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a higher score, but I just can't. My friend Christine was the one who brought me to this place a few times. I've been to the other locations around town, but this one is huge compared to the other ones. 
The positive: I love the way this place is set up. The decor is awesome and the sushi is quite unique (and in a good way). My favorite has to be the banana roll. The fish is placed upon fried banana slices. At first I was a little skeptical, but after taking the first bite I was hooked. Christine always orders the Mandingo. Without getting too graphic the roll is shaped like a certain body part of a man, complete with boys lol. Ain't gonna lie, it's an awesome roll, but fellas make sure you have a girl order for you. Unfortunately that's about as much as I can say about the positive aspect.
The negative: at times they have events there and when they do they blast music like it's a damn club. It's really hard to enjoy your meal when you feel like you're in the middle of XS. On top of it, this place has had 4-5 different \"grand opening.\" How many grand openings can one place have? The service is hit or miss at times, and I have had items never arrive to my table but they sure as heck showed up on my bill. 
Overall there are better places for sushi, but I probably be back again because they do offer naked sushi and that is something I would like to experience."}
{"text":"Not cheap but worth the price. Excellent food and environment. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Geisha  house has went down not good service change the taste of food service awful we quit going to the one on Desert inn it really could use an improvement uplift. An a much cleaner atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great service great food the best sushi I've had so far alot of quality and integrity goes into the food. I would highly recommend this place. On the down side they are serious about closing on time. They took our menus 30mins before closing and started shitting down."}
{"text":"Let's get the not-so-good out of the way first. Firstly, our Teppan chef was not Japanese. He was Hispanic. He was nice but was lacking in skills. You know the part where the Teppan chef demonstrates his knife skills? This guy basically banged the stove and made a lot of noises but really didn't do anything. The owner was also not Japanese. He was Korean. The stove itself was smaller than your normal Teppan place. It only seated about 6 people as oppose to other places where you can seat about 10 people. We were there on a Sunday Night about 6:00 PM and our table was the only one being used. The place is also about 5 miles from the Strip so be prepare to drive a while through the non-Vegas part of town. 

Here is good part. The food was delicious. I ordered the steak and it was unbelievably tasty. The portions were ample. We both could not finish our dinners and I can eat a lot. They used a \"pink sauce\" which is basically butter, garlic and food coloring. It sounds gross but it made the fried rice very tasty. The service was pretty good. The other waiters kept coming around to make sure we had our drinks. The price was very good despite being in Vegas. You can have a steak Teppan dinner for about $24.00. 

Overall, this is a decent place if you are in Vegas and you're sick of buffets and fancy restaurants that are ridiculously expensive. If you are new to Teppan, it would be impressive. If you are used to Benihana-types of restaurants, this place may not measure up."}
{"text":"The other restaurant on Desert Inn was closed due to constructions so we made the trek (25 miles) to this place because my wife  was craving the \"pink sauce\". In comparison to the other place, I would say this:

The Decor: While the other restaurant's decor was straight out of the 70's, this place is modern, lively and nicely decorated. It is located in a new strip mall with plenty of parking. 

The Food: The food is excellent as always. Our chef was nice and friendly. 

Prices: We were there during a holiday weekend so a smaller and more expensive menu was offered. Huh? So you have to pay more for the same exact food you would get normally. Not cool, Mr. Manager!"}
{"text":"The staff was a little rude to my group when we arrived, but they made up for it at the end of the night by not charging us for some of our appetizers. Overall though, the staff was great, so the early incident didn't ruin the whole experience. It was so much fun watching watching our food be made right in front of us. The food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good; ambiance fitting but service not the best. Our waitress got one of orders of sushi wrong and then after we cancelled the order they still tried to send us another order of sushi which was still wrong. Do not order the fried ice cream. Tastes like its already previously made and warmed."}
{"text":"Such amazing food with excellent customer service.  The employees were so nice and professional. We waited for a table due to them being busy and they got us drinks and appetizers while we waited. Called a taxi and it was an hour wait for them. They called and said it was an extra hour wait and we just tried our luck and asked for a ride back to the strip since they were closed and an employee was so nice and gave us a ride. 

Not only would I recommend their food because it was amazing and the special secret sauce was delicious.  I have to say the customer service is the best ever."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Good price, good service, fresh fish. Love it. Highly  recommend that place."}
{"text":"First time at Geisha House.  The interior is beautiful and we were seated right away.

We ordered drinks,  I had a lychee martini and it was so good.

The sushi was good, not fantastic,  but good. It was about average with many other sushi restaurants.

Our server, not so great. We had to keep looking for him and flag him down for drink refills and additional sushi orders.  The restaurant was not busy at all.

It was an alright experience. I might be back if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"This place is extremely over priced. Tempura udon for $18? Seriously? Everything on the dinner menu was over $17. This is just crazy to me. It's not like this place is a fancy ass restaurant on the strip or anything. It is in a Walmart shopping center next to Roberto's taco shop. We ended up getting 2 rolls. The Mexican Tempura roll and the Kanto Crunch roll priced at $12 each. Now I just need to taste these rolls real quick. BRB......

Okay. So the rolls were pretty big and pretty good. I would come here again just for the sushi. I am satisfied with the amount of food we got for the price. I still will not eat any of the dinner entrées here because there are so many other places I can get delicious tempura udon, katsu, etc. 

As for the ambiance, the restaurant has a very nice look. Modern. Although I must mention that the tables have a sticky feeling to them and smell as if they were wiped with a wet rag that has been sitting out for a week underneath the hot desert sun. Kind of a turn off while trying to enjoy a meal.

Waitress was pretty attentive. I mean, she should be since we are the ONLY ones in here. Lol. 

4 stars for the good service and good SUSHI. Minus 1 star for the over priced dinner entrées."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's 21st birthday.  We were a group of about 25 girls.

Service: I was the first person to arrive for the reservation, and thus waited for everyone else to come.  When about 5 of us finally showed up, I asked the waitress if we could be seated and she said not until our party showed up.  Finally, when about 11 of us came, I asked again and she said something about their dinner menu changing at 10 so we would have very little time to order from their normal menu.  I said it was fine, and asked if we could be seated.  She then said we might have to be seated separately, and I was under the impression that a reservation of 25 was made so there should be a reserved table for 25 guests.  I asked if that could be done, and then a high-up employee appears and says he is willing to put together seating for 25.  In my mind, I was like, \"Oh thank God!\"
After we were seated, no other problems occurred.
Food and drinks were good.  Sushi rolls tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Used to always go to Osaka (Henderson). Loving this option on this side of town. Much better food, bigger portions, super friendly staff!!  Teppanyaki was amazing as was the 1 roll (Harajuku Girls) we tried. Can't wait to fully try the sushi bar"}
{"text":"Seating arrangements for hibachi makes no sense. I was sat behind the chef so didn't get to enjoy the experience. Didn't make much of a difference seeing as the chef didn't put on a show. Just cooked regular and left. I was also charged a group gratuity when I wasn't in a group then asked again for a tip on my recipet. Came here for a birthday and they managed  to ruin it. Geisha house sold out, find another place to go, there are plenty in vegas that are much better."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Best hibachi at a great price. Staff is very attentive but not annoying. Food is amazing and you won't leave hungry. We are regulars and will keep going back.  Great for special occasions or just a nice evening out."}
{"text":"If you want sushi only and have a large party, go elsewhere.  They assume a large party will want hibachi dinner.  If you want all you can eat sushi, go elsewhere too.  The manager was accommodating enough where he let the majority our party order sushi and asked that 1 person order hibachi.  

If you do have the hibachi dinner, ask for Felix.  He's really nice, keeps the kids entertained and will interact with the table.  

The food is ok but the service was good."}
{"text":"New Years Eve took my kids 1 of which had never experienced this type of dinning and was excited to eat there....We've been several times and had no problems food was great service was great and always walked away satisfied....However this time No So Much!!!  I had reservations of which we had to wait for a table for 20 plus minutes okay not so bad...sit down and they have us separated I ask if they can sit us all together and they insisted that they could not....I tip the cook as he comes to the table of $20 for a GREAT show to empress my kids and of course it is New Years Eve....This cook does nothing I mean NOTHING for a show no flips no tricks NOTHING!!!  the food was okay at best and the waitress claimed she didn't have a voice and was yelling at us and we couldn't understand a word that came out of her mouth...not to mention the minute we all got home we were all sick....NOT a great way to bring in the New Year!!!!   Oh forgot to mention that we ordered sushi for appetizers and they came out when we were done with our meal all dried out!

I have eaten there several times in the past and love to show my support for local and minority business' being a minority myself....but really hesitant to return?!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the most bizarre experience at Geisha House during our visit to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Let me start off by saying the food was fabulous, our waiter was extremely kind and helpful, and hibachi chef Luis was so much fun. We were having a spectacular time... and then last call came around. When our waiter informed us of last call I ordered a cocktail and my husband requested a beer. My husband got his beer, but I never got my cocktail because of some type of drama with the bartender. I was informed the bartender refused to make my drink and had decided he was done for the night. Strange, but I accepted this and took a glass of water instead. Then, for at least another 20 mintues, my husband and I, along with the rest of the guests at our hibachi table, was treated to a rather unpleasant show where the bartender argued with the manager and other staff. For the sake of keeping this review family friendly, I won't repeat the things coming from the bartender's mouth. But needless to say, it just about completely ruined our anniversary dinner. The bartender's temper tantrum continued until we finally just couldn't stand to hear it anymore and my husband asked for it to stop. The manager apologized profusely and discounted our bill, but the bartender's escapades had already dampened our night. I'll most likely be back just because the food and rest of the staff were excellent, but I won't sit next to the bar again and listen to another tantrum."}
{"text":"Given the name I expected to be entertained by conversation, song, and dance. The conversation was decent (I like my family), watching the Hibachi was like a dance (well rehearsed moves), but the overall symphony of parts could have come together better for me.

Let me just start by saying the Hibachi cook was great. He actually did tricks I have never seen before, which was surprising. He was very personable and even cut the steak very thoroughly for my youngest.

 I wasn't thrilled about a couple of the things I ate, though. The dressing on my salad, and the freshness of the ingredients in the salad wasn't what I would expect for the price. The dressing was kind of chunky and almost tasted like fish sauce. It wasn't my cup of tea. My New York steak was also extremely fatty. Usually the steaks are trimmed really well when you eat Hibachi and this wasn't. I wasn't the only one in my party with the same complaint either. I also thought the dye in the butter they add to the rice was unnecessary. I know healthy eating isn't the forte of a Japanese steakhouse, but extra dye is pretty unnecessary. It's my pet peeve about Indian restaurants as well. One thing I really did enjoy was the shrimp tempura.

The service here was good as well. Our drinks were topped off and we were well taken care of the whole time. Overall, though, I would rather spend my money at Ohjah for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Excellent staff and phenomenal ambience to the restaurant! You will not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday. She was absolutely convinced this place had the best sushi. Usually people that go to places like Kabuki or Geisha House don't know good sushi is, so we just went along with it. 
The ambience was very club like and the waitress was less than educated on what she needed to know about the menu. 
The drinks were watered down. But the specialty drinks were very good. 
The sushi was well plated, but over sauced. The sashimi was okay. The prices overall are priced for this place for a dinner for 2 with edamame as an appetizer at $75 plus tip..was..a bit steep for us."}
{"text":"Geisha house has very great food! I love the selections they have on the menu. One thing I loved the most were the girls that dressed up at geishas in the front!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service from most staff horrible. We went in at 8:30pm, on a weekday; only 4 tables were occupied. They told us \"5 minutes\"... Go figure! The whole place was empty. 15 minutes later, they still would not sit us down, I almost got up and left. 
The bartender would not let us carry our tab into the table; I had to settle that separately. LOW CLASS. 
Our waited was very nice and that is the only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of no stars. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!! Dylan put on awesome show and was very friendly. I'll definitely come back to this location :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere at the new geisha house location off flamingo. The food is exceptional and the service was impeccable. The servers were exceptionally polite and very attentive throughout our meal. The sushi was phenomenal and we loved the music. Will def be going back sometime soon. The place was packed and yet it didn't seem like any of the staff was overwhelmed. Great time."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Coming from Hawaii to Vegas we found a place that we enjoyed then we found OUR SPOT! So many dishes. Such a great atmosphere. We always sit at the bar and fully enjoy yourself every time. We love this place."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! The decor is very cool inside and out. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation and were seated right away. The menu is very expansive and the cocktails were delicious. We ended up catching the tail end of Happy Hour, which turned out to be a great deal. The food from the apps down the main meal was delicious. We're very critical sometimes when it comes to sushi joints, but we couldn't find a thing to complain about."}
{"text":"Service was crowded and the waiter was never there to serve you. The food on the other hand was amazing and loved the meats, a ton of food and would go again if the prices aren't crazy high!!!"}
{"text":"really good food...spent a little more than we thought we would but it was great...will be back soon."}
{"text":"We had an exceptional time. Our chef at the Teppanyaki table was very entertaining and efficient.  Everyone at our table was delighted with their dinner.  The soup was very flavorful, the salad with ginger dressing was very nice, the smoking drink was something new, which we had fun with.  Very Entertaining, but Caution. Dry ice is so cold it will burn you. Do Not Touch It!
The waitress happily brought us fresh ginger.  The all-inclusive price was very reasonable.  So happy to have such a nice restaurant open up in this neighborhood. We took our time and were not rushed at all. The manager who greeted us was very polite and welcoming. Great Experience!"}
{"text":"After about an hour of figuring out what my boyfriend and I wanted for dinner, we finally settled for Geisha House. Im so glad we did! Dinner was spot on and the show was cool too! We got Chef Eddy and he was very informative and had alot of stories. Will defiantly be back again! Thanks Chef Eddy for an amazing dinner, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere. The sushi was delicious, and the waitress and waiter came by to check on us often and to refill beverages."}
{"text":"So for the last seven months I've been consistently falling deeper in love with this place. It's mine and my sweethearts favorite place to eat sushi in Vegas, even though we have to travel a bit further to get it. My daughter reviewed this restaurant when she was out here months back and it was fantastic then and has consistently remained so. 
We always sit at the bar and all the chefs are great, but our hands down favorite is Chris. His sushi knowledge is vast and if you tell him what kind of flavors you like, he'll pin point what's right for you.

We love the salmon seeker and always enjoy the sashimi which can only be enjoyed at places where the fish is fresh.

We also enjoy the full bar and the service is always great! A North Las Vegas find."}
{"text":"Reservation was at 7, wasn't seated until 45 minutes later. Understandable, it was a party of 8. Decided to hit up the happy hour in the bar area. Got some few drinks and waited.

We were then sat in a semi circle, teppanyaki style seating arrangement. Ordered shrimp and the bf ordered chicken. With the meal, it comes with mushroom beef broth soup, veggies, and rice. 

Chef's service was amazing. Very engaging with the crowd. Food was good to. All in all, the experience was at least 4/5 stars. 1 star deduction due to the wait."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner. Have to say I was impressed. The restaurant is very beautiful with great decor. The presentation of the food is very eye appealing and the service we received was top notch. The timing of the food was quite fast as well.  Overall, a very pleasant dinner was enjoyed. 

Only disappointing fact was we had made reservations for the teppan table and after waiting for 20 minutes (in the lobby) we were told it would be another 30 minutes because they were behind and one cook had called in. We asked realistically how long would it really be and after the hostess told us there were still 3 tables the cook needed to attend to before he would get to the table we would be at, we decided to just sit at the regular dining table. We were a bit excited for the teppan table but we realized it would be too late, which we did see about an hour into our meal that the cook finally did get to the teppan table we would have been at.  (-1 on stars)

We tried the baked mussels and stuffed mushrooms, they were pretty tasty. Only thing it was a bit of an overload on the crab meat topping. 

Loved the shishito peppers, yellowtail jalapeño carpachio and to end the night the honey toast was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed..we left very hungry and spent 80.00... Took my 10 year old daughter for a celebration with my husband we made reservations,that went well when we were seated at the hibachi grill they took our order my daughter and I got steak my husband got chicken... To start the soup was bland it had mushrooms and green onions all except my husband's that was just warm liquid then they brought the salad the lettuce was fresh but lacked in dressing.. The rice was ok but the pink butter turned us off and the rice lacked in flavor. The chicken was extremely bland (could have made it better at home on the stove) the steaks were VERY SMALL for the high price and had no flavor at all... I rather go to Osaka.. The service was not very impressive neither... Not happy spending 80.00 and still left hungry..."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The service was awesome from our waitress who was on top of drinks and seating us to Edward our cook who was talkative and awesome with his tricks and everything!!! We had a great time from start to finish. We were celebrating a birthday and they definitely made it memorable for us! We had to wait a little bit for the table to warm up but that was the only thing... And we got a free side off the bill for checking in on yelp. We have been to the other location off off the 215 and Decatur but I'm glad we went here to experience this one because it was quiet and seemed more personal and again the staff here is definitely the reason we would come back here!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with my husband and friends. This is the old Sapporo geisha took over with minimal remodeling. Sat outside on the patio and immediately a bunch of cockroaches! We moved inside and still cockroaches made their way in from the patio all the way into the dining room it was so bad our waiter kept apologizing and had to kick & stomp on them. My girlfriend & husband was about to have a heart attack. Food was good, service was excellent  but I would suggest them call ECOLAB ASAP! And get that cockroaches infestation taken care of. We notified the manager at first he was defensive and asked us what we wanted him to do but after we told him \"as a manager it is your responsibility to insure your guests have a pleasant experience so you tell us what your going to do\" he was reluctant at first to do anything but apologize for the cockroaches running around everywhere and admitted that it's been a ongoing situation but the careless owners won't do anything about it. So he finally took 50% off our bill. But this doesn't change the fact that they don't take care of the rodents in their establishment. ECOLAB!!! They need you!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Geisha or 20+ years and it is always pretty good.  The new location on flamingo is a really nice restaurant, however the food isn't as good as the original one.  They do have a great happy hour and the non-teppanyaki food is pretty good."}
{"text":"We made a reservation days ago and they don't have it.  I drove across town for this meal.  Simply inexcusable.  Save yourself a headache and don't eat here."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here for lunch dates. He loves sushi and I hate it. But this is a great place to have the best of both worlds. We enjoy sitting at the bar to watch the sushi chefs make the rolls. We get miso soup and a cucumber salad that's complimentary. I order the bento lunch box that comes with a salad, rice, shrimp and veggie tempura, and steal teriyaki. By far some of the best teriyaki I have ever had. The sushi is great too."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Geisha house! Haven't had the sushi but the Hibachi was delicious and super entertaining for the kids. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot! Bar seating was pretty open, not too busy. Service was excellent. My friend and I ordered a few small plates to share and a couple of their unique signature cocktails. Their sake blend cocktails were so unique and so delish! Def recommend trying. Their small plates were decently priced, but very small portions. Almost unable to share. Ordered their garlic edamame and it had red chili spices. That was a surprise. Nice twist, if you can stand the heat. For me, it was far too much. I'll return, mainly for the cocktails and friendly service, but I'll make my food choices more wisely."}
{"text":"I would not come back here.  Server was not attentive.  Walked away while I was asking her a question.  Didn't understand or pay attention to certain requests.  They charge $12 to share a plate.  The prices are too high and the quality is not great.  I can name several teppanyaki restaurants in town that I would choose over this.  It's too bad because the space is actually nice. The flavors were not there.  Nothing I would want to come back for.  The owner looked unhappy or upset while she lurked outside of the private room... Staring us down waiting for us to leave.  She rudely walked in to tell the chef to hurry up and clean.  We all heard her and saw her demeanor.  It was a large party... We spent a significant amount of money.  The only stars that I'm giving are for the chef who was atleast very nice, entertaining, and fun."}
{"text":"So we went into the geisha house for the first time on our day night and used a group on. I didn't have my id and couldn't sit at the bar and thought I wasn't going to be able to use my groupon for the happy hour but the manager came over and said that we could sit-in the main dining room area as long as I wasn't trying to drink any alcoholic drinks. Sounds fair to me . This place is really nice, romantic ambiance. The sushi was delicious and fresh and the service was premium. Sometimes when we use group ones people treat me weird but they treated us with respect and kindness and for that we will be back again, even without the group on ! :)"}
{"text":"Came way out to this part of town for an event, otherwise we probably never would have made our way here. 

I would have given them a much higher rating, but several aspects of the meal combined resulted in a mediocre and anger-inducing experience.

The first thing we noticed upon our arrival was the obnoxious birthday singing accompanied by horns, whistles and a loud speaker. Understandable, as most places do this kind of thing, but it happened at least 4 times during our time there. There was a guy running around doing shots with people and singing songs, blowing his whistle and joking around. 

Once we were seated, we waited a while before Eric came and took our drink orders, explaining the different types of sake flavors to us and being overall boisterous. Fine, you're super-genki-man, we get it.  I can even be cool with that, but the problem arose when he explained the \"Mother's Day Special\" to us and conned us all into getting it. Yes, conned. We were told that for our $80 meal we'd get an appetizer, 2 wine glasses of flavored sake, soup, salad, fried rice, veggies and a portion of teppanyanki-cooked lobster & filet mignon PLUS a $20 gift card. Which made it seem totally worth the price- after all, the meals themselves cost about $20-30 a piece normally and that'd be 2 for one! BUT, when we paid our bill, the gift card turned out to be good ONLY for the location we were at. If this restaurant was in our neighborhood, that'd be cool- but this location is out in the boondocks of north town and we're coming out from East-central. And not only that, but the gift card is only good for their sushi, which from the reviews I'm less than enthusiastic about traveling back the 20 miles to try. We felt totally misled by the deal. If we had known, we would have opted for another, cheaper meal option.

The food itself... the soup was good- I was expecting a miso soup but it turned out to be a flavorful clear soup with fried onions and button mushrooms. I liked it but the mushrooms seemed out of place. The salad itself was simple salad mix with a piece of cucumber and tomato topped with a miso vinegarette- tasty, but nothing particularly revolutionary. The appetizer we chose was shrimp tempura- 2 pieces of shrimp and 1 piece of sweet potato and 1 piece of zucchini. I'm guessing we got the shrimp and veggie, then? Crunchy with a yummy sauce, but kind of misleading and I wouldn't have been happy to pay the $8 for it. After that the chef came out, he had a great tableside manner and entertained our group. He and the super-attentive waitresses were what got the star for the place. He started by juggling some eggs and quick frying them. After that, the rice and the ubiquotus special sauce came out. TONS of fried rice, coated in a weird pink butter/shortening \"special sauce\"- I'm guessing something with MSG and other seasonings because it made me feel unpleasant after. The shrimp, lobster and steak were all coated in it, too, as others have said. The portions were much smaller- 3 shrimp, half a lobster tail and roughly 3-4 ounces of filet mignon per person. Two of our companions asked to have extra steak instead of the lobster but got the same portion as us without the lobster. The lobster itself was overcooked and one of our companions thought it tasted like eggs. 

When we got our bill, the sake we had ordered was actually 2 dollars more than what was listed on the menu. Not a huge amount- but in this economy it's worth noting. With the $80 meal, 1 small bottle of sake [9.50 instead of 7.50], 1 Orion beer [$8] & 1 Sapporo [$7.50] our bill came out to over $110. Which I wouldn't have minded paying if I hadn't felt misled about the card, the quality of the food was better, and we didn't have SUPER loud music being blasted every 15-20 minutes with super-genki-man running around with a bullhorn and whistle.. It felt like I was paying for the show and not the food, and the environment just wasn't enjoyable for my boyfriend and I. Maybe it's better during the week or lunch, but it was a lot of flash for hardly any quality."}
{"text":"We have visited this place many times for lunch.  The prices are a little high, but the food is good.  The wait time to get seated is hit and miss as it seems they have some staffing issues.  I wish they were more kid friendly.  They do not have a kids menu at lunch.  Why can't they put a plate together for a reasonable price? Something like 5.95 or 6.95 with a free drink?  Will not go back until something changes."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey, but the service and food is worth it. The chefs/cooks put on a good show and are very friendly. The only down side was my group of 9 had to wait for all of us to arrive to be seated. It would have been nice to be able to sit at the table and wait for everyone else instead of bottlenecking at the front."}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say I enjoyed  everything it was soooo amazing!! I had about five of their tapas all very good, simbal wings full of flavor not too spicy, salmon carpaccio light fresh and delicious, lamb lollipops soooo unexplainably good. I don't know what more I can say everything blew my mind nothing close to what I was expecting!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived a little before 5 pm and were seated at a regular table. We both ordered the chicken hibachi entrée from the kitchen, as the grills weren't open. Our miso soup was extremely salty but had a good amount of seaweed and tofu. I couldn't finish my bowl because it was so salty. I suppose they have a \"signature pink fried rice\" that was terrible. No veggies in the rice and whatever their pink ingredients were for the rice didn't go well at all with the rest of the entrée. The hibachi grilled veggies were covered in grease enough to pool on the plate covering the rice and meat, completely overcooked and mushy. Both of our chicken portions were overcooked and chewy and did not taste like hibachi at all. Our drinks were never refilled though there were two other occupied tables. We cannot speak to the sushi experience but their hibachi grill leaves much to be desired; we will not be back."}
{"text":"I had some sashimi, mochi for dessert, hubby had pan roasted salmon. It's all good but honestly nothing that spectacular and not worth the prices. I didn't have anything in particular that was good enough to bring me back or go into further detail with this review. Oh and we did have some honey toast for dessert as well, I definitely do not recommend this from here, way over cooked and just not very good."}
{"text":"So I'm new to the North Las Vegas area, and was looking for a \"regular\" sushi spot. This place is located in a strip mall and we decided to stop in one night after driving by a few times. The food was excellent. I had the steak it was cooked perfectly. The sashimi was fresh, and I had the spicy salmon roll, that too was excellent. The service was ok. The second time I went was with a large group for a birthday celebration, we sat at the grill. Our cook was very engaging and hilarious. The service this time was excellent. The food again was awesome, We had the sampler with steak, shrimp, and lobster. I recommend sharing its 10.00 and you get your own soup and salad and if I remember correctly it also includes another appetizer. Because we were there for a birthday our cook bought the birthday girl a saki bomb, the staff had everyone chant and then shoot! It was a very fun experience. Will definitely be my regular spot."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour
5/5 service
the guys were great and accommodated a table of 8 for us, girl up front was nice too

3/5 food
Chicken wings were well worth it $8. Sliders were dry, and they came with fries which were nothing special at all $8. Tried pieces of the spicy salmon and california rolls, worth it for $4 bucks i believe. $3 for beer you get what you pay for... it was pbr. The craft beer selection was ehh.. but at least they had a dog fish head ipa 90 minute.

3/5 Overall
The place has a nice feel, people were taking sake bomb shots which must be the thing there. I can see going there for that or happy hour. They also have teppanyaki there, which I havent tried. To be honest I would just go for the chicken wings and an ipa."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go with friends. The food is great and worth going just my husband and I, but the atmosphere and sake bombs makes for a much more eventful night if you're in a larger group. 

The filet is phenomenal. Tender and delicious. I love the \"pink\" rice also; just another way Geisha House adds to the experience. The cooks are always a lot of fun and very entertaining. It's not uncommon for the cook to do a sake bomb (or 2) with the group, on us of course! I am not a fan of the soup, but I honestly am just not a fan of the flavor regardless of where it is served. The salad is decent and the vegetables are good. Aside from that, the only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they will not seat you until every last member of your group is there. While I understand this is to prevent us from taking up space, if we want to get seated and start with a few sake bombs I don't think we should be denied that. That aside, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Bombest teppan ever. It's a small spot but the food is amazing. never had a bad experience here. I love their pink garlic butter so yummy. Fried rice is bomb."}
{"text":"My husband and I managed to escape our 11 month old for a date night and we are glad we stopped in. We were craving some sushi and we really enjoyed everything from the ambiance to the food and of course the service. We ordered 3 rolls. Screaming geisha,  love my ass and one other roll but the screaming geisha was a hands down winner. We also has some red snapper nigiri which was super delish!!!! Oh, and how could I forget, the eggrolls! They were an amazingly refreshing snippet of joy with their crispy fluffiness and abundance of sauce! There were at least 3 different people who brought water refills and everyone provided 5 star service even responding with \"my pleasure\" when we said thank you! Woo hoo! Hopefully we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch and it was nothing to complain about considering their lunch menu.  The lunch menu is significantly cheaper than their dinner, but the portions are smaller.  I don't know by how much but thats what I was told.  For about 12 bucks I was able to get steak, veggies, and yummy fried rice off the grill.  Its hard to find good Teppanyaki for a decent price but this hit the mark.  If the food quality is what it was during dinner, than I doubt I'd want to pay 30$ or 40$ during dinner time, even if it is a bigger portion.  Maybe the quality is better for dinner, but I'd really hope thats not their train of thought.  The service was great and friendly and there wasn't any wait.  For a tasty, cheap lunch, this was a great option!"}
{"text":"went to dinner last night and was pleasantly surprised.
Devi was great again.  She recommended sushi, sliders and good wine.
Food was fresh, hot and very tasty!!
Great Job!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few happy hour places I've been to with my friends that has been consistent every single time. The lychee martini and kiwilicious drinks are amazing with real fruits in them. Food is average but the drinks, service and ambience makes up for it. I will keep returning for their happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time here! People chef and servers are all very friendly food are delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, they messed up three of our orders though so some of my family members were pretty annoyed. Maybe the waitress was new. The food would get 4 stars. But the service could have been better."}
{"text":"Fun place for group parties!
Last time I came here was for a birthday party full of women! 
The service from our server was ok but our chef was outstanding! Very interactive and fun! He definitely had us all laughing! Was such a good time and well worth the visit! I saw the next party over and their chef didn't seem as fun as ours. But we enjoyed our visit! Make sure you request an outgoing chef for your party!"}
{"text":"ooookkkk... So, having been to the original Geisha House on the East Side I have to say this one isn't as good.  First the service was poor. The host was good the waitress - Rosa I think.  Could barely understand her.  She did the minimum ok but that was it.  The seating and decor is very modern but not as comfy as the one on the East Side.  Also, there were all these stipulations - you can order the Geisha special but you can't share it and if you share it it's $10.95. Ok, no problem.  So, we ordered two Geisha Specials for three people and paid the \"share fee\" no problem.  Then the \"appetizer\" comes Yakatori and Veggie tempura. Two sticks of Yakatori and five tempura.  This is TWO Geisha Specials ($71)?  Ok.  So they are yummy I will say that.  Also the onion and ONE mushroom soup broth thing was delish even though it hardly had anything in it.  So ok.  Then they come to cook our meal at a table we shared with a family of four (two kids and two adults) and we personally got ONE steak, two chicken, two tiny lobsters and some shrimp.  Didn't look like two Geisha specials to me.  Further the spice/seasoning level is WAY DOWN from the one on the east side. You know how good their rice is (if you don't, it is) and this location's rice needed soy sauce.  Didn't even add any heat to it at all.  So in short, it was OK.  But not worth the money. If you want to truly experience how good Geisha House can be - go to the one on the East Side if it's still there."}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour with a bunch of friends for a bday celebration. We went on a Saturday night around 6. I don't know if they were under staffed or don't normally get large groups but it was very clear our one waiter couldn't not keep up with us. He came around quickly to get new people drink and food orders but that was it, he never came back to ask if we wanted to order another drink or more food and then the servers started showing up with food that was never ordered, other people from the party left the table and went to the bar to order drinks and had their food cleared from the table before even getting to eat it. The staff was friendly just not very attentive which caused them to not get many repeat drink orders. The food was delicious though and I had two servings of the coconut shrimp however it is a bit pricey for just 3 pieces of shrimp at 7$. I will likely go back just with a smaller group."}
{"text":"I have no idea where to start. The stir fry chef was very polite and nice, and very skilled in stunts involving cooking oil and a lighter. The food is very delicious, the fried rice (that always comes out) is flavorful and crisp. I ordered a steak and the meat was just so tender and juicy and warm and soft and it melted in my mouth like butter. Ayy this steakhouse is a must - go when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for their Livingsocial special - a 4 course dinner for two that was $60 and included a wine, shared appetizer, two salads, a shared Rib Eye steak with kimchi Brussels sprouts & side and a shared dessert. 

Portion sizes are small and there is an excess of sauces and plate decorations. 

For 7:30 PM a Saturday, the restaurant was mostly empty, but that didn't stop the restaurant from making us wait 20 minutes past our reservation before seating us. 

Decor is overly hip and trendy. 

Wait staff was excellent and spaced the food at good intervals and kept water glassed filled and plates cleared. 

Overall, the dinner wasn't worth the reduced price from Livingsocial and would not have been worth the full price."}
{"text":"Well 1st time and holly cow greAt happy hour ! Robert and Devi great bar tenders entertaining! Food and house wine worth the money :) !"}
{"text":"Overpriced food. We had the dinner plates (chicken, pork and Rib eye) The chicken, ribs and vegetables were smothered with too much oil and marinade. The Panko pork was good and had the right amount of sauce."}
{"text":"I love geisha house but this location is the worse of them all only because of their sushi and service.

I love their hibachi dinner I can't complain about it because it's always on point and never a disappointment. Now the sushi is terrible there! It's really sad because all the other locations have some good sushi at their place. I order some nigiri sushi and they didn't give me rice with it and when I asked they said that's not how they do it there and if I wanted rice with my sushi I had to pay more. Ummm what they hell!

Most of the servers there are young but really nice there and are very attentive the reason why I said service is bad is because of their responses to my request. Another request I asked was I wanted another bowl of their mushroom soup and the server laughs and goes yous gottas to pay extra. I just believe you should speak in a professional manner and do what the customer asks for."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant after shopping around this location numerous times . First impression was very nice interior design. Seated at table by hostess . Ordered drinks . Looked at the menu and couldn't find much entree in there , it was hard for me to figure out the menu and how to order .... There was not much varieties other than 2 pages of drinks, some sushi and hibachi. I was hoping there were more dinner entrees. Just not what I expected. Paid for drinks and left. I would say this restaurant is too fancy for its location. It's best to dine for special occasions."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is always good and the cooks are lots of fun most of the time. I tried different appetizers and meats and all are cooked as I wanted. The sauces are also very good and tasty."}
{"text":"My first time eating here.  They got 3 out of the 4 rolls we ordered wrong, they didn't check in on us or bring out the ginger and Wasabi until we specifically asked for it. Then, after all of the order mixups, they discounted $1 off of the total ticket and said it was for the mixup.  Terrible customer service. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great service, tried teppan and it was good! Fun and tasty drink option. Recommend to try ginger mojito"}
{"text":"Chef George was great and very personable. Dinner went well, but were very disappointed that the didn't have all the desserts in the menu, only the basic stuff. Even when I mentioned some of the drinks they didn't have either. Atmosphere is very nice and modern, but I have had better for less price."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Geisha House in NLV for years.  Two of us in our party ordered meals with shrimp as the main dish.  When it was served, the shrimp had not been deveined.  The chef noticed as I picked at it on my plate and immediately said that was terrible and it shouldn't be that way and aplogized profusely and he himself summoned what he said was a manager.  Someone eventually came over and stated the manager was not on premesis but she would take 10% off.  I informed her our main dish was entirely shrimp and somehow that didn't seem adequate.  She offered to cook more shrimp, however, after the whole situation, our appetites for shrimp were lost. Shrimp can also not be reheated. She then disappeared for a long time and returned with a bill for $128.00 that was minus 13.00 for the two shrimp dinners that were ruined. $13.00?? Not $26.00, $13.00! She stated she spoke to her manager and that's what they can do.  I reminded her that our entire meal we were paying our hard earned money for was shrimp and she was taking 13.00 off and that was not the right thing to do and she walked away. 
I have had awful lobster there before, brought it to their attention so they didn't make the mistake of serving bad lobster again and paid for it because I am not ever one to try and get anything for free. This time was enough.  It's obvious they only care about money and zero about customer retention.
Bye Geisha House!"}
{"text":"The Geisha special was awesome! The flavor of all the dishes was far superior to any comparable restaurants I've visited. From the soup (the fried onions add so much flavor!) to the salad (yummy dressing) to the tender filet mignon to the delicious lobster and perfectly cooked chicken, everything tasted amazing. The fried rice had this awesome pink garlic butter that made it impossible to stop eating. Often at hibachi restuarants, the veggies are under cooked and bland, but not here! They were perfectly addictive. So much food! A great value for the price!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Sat at the hibachi table and it was really good, very entertaining. Definitely come hungry. Sushi here was also really ono. Most likely to come back for the sushi during happy hour."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience! We came here for my mothers birthday. When we walked in there was only about 2 other parties there.. The restaurant is cute and intimate and has an old school Japanese steakhouse vibe but they play modern upbeat music that is at just the right volume! We all ordered the geisha special which starts off with soup (best Asian soup I've ever had) and salad (with a house made dressing that was light and refreshing) it also came with choice of appetizer which we all got individual servings. We all got the calamari except my mom who got the shrimp tempura. The calamari came with a sauce that the chef makes in house that has just the right amount of sweet and spicy! 


Our chef Eddie came out just as soon as we finished with our appetizer! He introduced himself then did a fun knife and spatula presentation that my kids loved! He did the fun quirks along the way (onion volcano, onion train, heart shape rice, fake egg and fake ketchup bottle) all things had us laughing! 

The geisha special comes with an amazing entree which is fried rice (seriously best fried rice I'd ever had) , filet mignon, chicken , lobster and shrimp! Everything was made with their \"special sauce\" and wow that sauce has to be the star of the show!! 

Oh side note the geisha special also comes with either a soft drink, wine or sake! What an amazing deal!! We will absolutely be coming back to geisha house!"}
{"text":"It's hard not to enjoy hibachi. I especially loved this place. The food and service is fantastic.  My wife has a shell fish allergy and they were able to accommodate her."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been to Geisha house probably a million times when we lived in Aliante.  Usually later in the night because thats when we both have time to eat.  One random day we went around opening of the grill and we got to meet CHEF JEFF.  The food is amazing of course because we keep going back but the this time we had Chef Jeff and it was by far hands down the best experience ever!

He was very social.  He wasnt trying to show off.  He listened to what we liked.  My steak was actually medium and perfect.  He noticed i am obsessed with the pink sauce and the white dipping sauce.  All in all if you go back or go for the first time ask to be sat at Chef Jeff's table...THE BEST!"}
{"text":"5 stars for this place. 

I go to the laser hair removal center right next door and eat here about 4 times a week. Their lunch box is delicious. Service is prompt and friendly. Prices are reasonable. 

The sushi is fresh and they have the best spicy scallop hand roll in town

For dinner I have tried their teppenyaki.  It was amazing. You have to try their red fried rice. The food was fresh and the chief was very well trained. He did some fun tricks. I had the steak wife had the shrimp. Fairly priced for teppenyaki and I would recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Yummy! Came here for a friend's birthday party. If you're sitting at the grill, ask for Felix, he was great and entertaining. I got some fried rice, and two rolls. 007 was ok, kind of plain. The creamy shrimp crunch roll was delicious! Prompt service, good food, will definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We love trying new sushi restaurants. Plus we got a great Groupon deal for this? Lets give this a try!

Groupon was good for one order from the regular roll menu, one order from their three sections of special roll menu, and one full bottle of sake. The sake had a retail price of $25.00 and our Groupon was $29.00. Great deal.

Lively atmosphere and service was good. We sat at the restaurant area but they also have a section for Tepanyaki. (Set-up was like Benihana style.) 

We ordered:
-Shishito Peppers for my boyfriend.
-Fried pork dumplings for myself. (6 pieces per order.)
-Spicy Tuna Roll. (That's our staple sushi. We order a STR no matter where we're at.)
-Double D. Inside: Shrimp Tempura, Crab, Cucumber. Outside: Spicy Salmon, Avocado, Screaming Orgasm Sauce. (Very very delicious and flavorful.)

It's great they had a Groupon deal. Otherwise, I would've never known about this place. Also...be sure to check-in to this place with your Yelp App because you get a free order of mochi ice cream. We got the green tea flavored one and it came with two pieces. Well...one piece split in half. Perfect sized dessert to finish our dinner of the night!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is decent; however the service is terrible. The waiter, Alex lee, was friendly but forgot to place my order with the cook. I waited 30 mins for food that never came. Then the restaurant had the audacity to auto charge an 18% gratuity. If I receive good service, I leave a generous tip. If you don't look at your check, you might tip them twice because even if they auto charge you 18% there is another tip line almost tricking you into leaving a tip on top of the 18% gratuity. According to new IRS rules as of January 1st, there is no more automatic gratuity charge. Gratuity is \"gratitude\" for good service. The manager, Ryan, returned our gratuity money after we complained about it. I recommend eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"One minor mistake with a salad tonight; but, that's it. The happy hour food menu is much shorter; but, still good. They apologized for the salad. They always make this one if my favorite places to come!  Devi is a sassy, fun and helpful server!  Most of the bar staff are!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for my Mother's 70th birthday celebration dinner.  I actually wanted to take her to a very reputable Steakhouse but she insisted on dining here since it's been her favorite place for special occassions. They have two locations... the one near the strip has been around since the 1980's I believe and has been a local and non-local favorite spot for many. 

I would suggest to make a reservation since this location is a local spot,  you may have to wait if you don't... Better safe than sorry.

There is a bar separate from two main dining rooms. One for Teppanyaki ( the decor is simple yet pleasant to look at, the lighting is dim... just the way I like it! ) and the other a more hip trendy lit area that gives off a L.A. joint vibe. I never been to a Teppanyaki place here in Vegas that played some really good beats... hip hop Hooray for me =) It really put me in a happy, want to sing along mood to every song. Hey DJ you ARE playing all my songs!!! Even my family was jammin to the beats.


Our Chef was entertaining and got us to interact with him from catching food in our mouth wow never knew my family is soo talented, to scare the living Sh** out of me from putting sauce on my face BUT it was fake... He even talked to us and carried a decent conversation while cookin up a storm for us... skills... MAD skills I tell ya.

We all ordered the Geisha Special which is Lobster, Chicken, Filet Mignon, Shrimp with fried rice and tempura. Also comes with salad that was refreshingly crisp and tasty. The soup broth with bits of mushroom slices had a burst of flavor even though it looked oh so simple. The tempura was lightly deep fried to perfection and enjoyed each crisp bite of hotness.

The fried rice was colorful and delicious... I admired the texture of the rice which made it very enjoyable. The Lobster meat was juicy and plumped... Filet was chunky and tender... Chicken was plentiful and all the meats were cooked in no sauce but only seasoning that made it absolutely delicious and satisfying. They have their own house special dipping sauce on the side for the meats but in reference to cooking with Teriyaki Sauce?!?! LOL You gotta be kiddin me... I know what that tastes like and there's no Teriyaki Bowl Teppanyaki here. 

Overall my Mother had a great birthday dinner... happy with Sake, food and service was memorable, alcohol beverages were made strong * Good Job!! not watered down like some places, had tons of leftovers, which I was sooo excited to wake up for the next day, and now understand why my Mother loves this place so much. Go there BUT come hungry!!!"}
{"text":"I've always been fond of Teppanyaki. Not only for the food, but also for the entertainment. And this is exactly what Geisha House provides. A great ambiance, delicious food, and simply just having a fun time. 

My Family usually celebrates someone's birthday here. So much so, it's been somewhat of a tradition every year. Mine seems to be every two years. This year we came here for my Mother's 21 birthday bash celebration. I adore the kimonos that the hostess wore. It's elegant, yet sexy. Nice touch to bring back the  traditional Japanese dress. 

We were greeted by a smiling, friendly hostess that took us to our teppan table as soon as we walked in. Our server Lu? came by and took our drink orders. We all opt for their Geisha Special. My brother and I substituted the chicken with scallops. My uncle substituted the chicken with salmon. Both for an additional charge, which wasn't that much at all.

All Dinners Include: Soup, Salad, Hibachi Shrimp, Mushroom, Onions, Zucchini, Bean Sprouts and Fried Rice. And with the GEISHA SPECIAL, it Include: Choice of Appetizer (Shrimp Tempura, Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura or Egg Roll) Choice of Drinks (Small Sake, House Wine or Soft Drink) Entrees : FILET MIGNON, CHICKEN AND LOBSTER. You just can't beat this combination deal. 

All the tables that occupied the teppan grill were celebrating a birthday. I can see why though. The Teppan Chefs here have a witty personality, love making food jokes plus tricks, even turning it up with a blue flashing light to make some boombox beats with their spatulas. Whaaat?! We were fortunate to have Chef Don as our Teppan Chef for this evening. He had this chill locomotion energy about himself that we enjoyed interacting with. He made jokes and tricks with our meals.. don't want to spoil the fun for anyone, but I thought the smiling face to cute dog was adorable. The best part of this experience was when he turned the blue flashing light on. He looked at my Mom and told her.. Come on stand up.. stand up.. stand up! My Mom looked stunned. Then he proceeded with come on.. stand up.. you gotta dance!!! You're the Birthday Girl!!! And next thing I knew, my Mom actually got up and started shakin her salt shaker! Chef Don started making some boombox beats with his spatulas and we were all having a blast. Tears of laughter was all around our table. The most memorable, yet fun time we ever had dining here. I even got that on video ;) 

The highlights I enjoyed here were the Tempura Shrimp and Vegetable combo, Fried Rice, huge juicy Scallops, Filet Mignon, and Lobster. Love their dipping sauces! Just remember the creamy orange sherbet color is for the meat, the middle is for the seafood, and the dark brown transparent color is for your veggies. The middle sauce has some wasabi or horseradish in it.. you'll taste that kick, so be ready for it! That creamy sauce for the meat is delicious. It enhances the flavor and takes it to another level. I wish I can duplicate this sauce for all my meat indulgence! 

The service was great in refills of drinks ( I drank 3 ginger ales!!! Could have been 5, but refused to have more! ), needing anything else, to taking away any finished plates. Quite observant throughout our whole dining experience. This place seems to attract Families, Friends get together, and Group outings. It's an awesome place to be in having a great meal, funny fun entertainment, and making some everlasting, cherished memories!"}
{"text":"As soon as we came in we loved the place! The staff was very friendly and sat us right away. (It was a Monday night). We ordered the Geisha special which comes with lobster, chicken and fillet mignon with an appetizer and wine or sake and we shared it. Awesome portions and the food was delicious!! We will be back regularly!"}
{"text":"Terrible dining experience on every level. Long story short, the service was beyond slow. We waited several minutes to be greeted once sat. Once the girl took our drink and food order at once, it took about 10 minutes to get water, and after asking two different servers for my wine, at least another 10 for that. 

We were told 30 minutes for our dinner but waited about 45, and got over cooked seafood. The lobster was completely inedible, but since no one came back to check on us, we had to tell the receptionist to get a manager. The \"manager\" came over and said she could take the $4 off for the lobster, because it came with shrimp and the tiniest scallops ever. We just laughed and said thank you for that. Our server never did come back to the table, not even once after we got our food, and it's not that they were even that busy.

I will say there was one, and only one, awesome employee. Props to the busser with the dark hair, half up in a ponytail. He was literally the only one who came to our our table to see how we were. Thank you for the one person with work ethic and a positive attitude. The other busser(blonde)walled right past us when we were standing at the door waiting for someone to greet us. 

Horrible service, less than mediocre food, and never returning back. Thanks for a stellar date night with my husband."}
{"text":"Hibachi (teppanyaki) was good, but the price is comparable to other spots in Vegas that are better quality."}
{"text":"Expensive and salty. Really not impressed with the chefs or the customer service. Probably won't go back unless it's for someone's birthday or something where I don't have a say where we go."}
{"text":"We come here often great cooks and servers. Drinks are tasty, and they just added a salsa night, what! Nice place"}

The experience and food were superb. The food came out really fast . Which was great because we had hungry children. I also want to thank the staff for being very accommodating. There was a little mishap with the group on I purchased and the staff was very sympathetic and accommodated our orders . We had the sushi ,chicken and steak meals . The meats where delivered seasoned and tender . Cooked to perfection ! Thank you all .! 
My family and I will definitely be back .!! Give them a try . You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since early 90's and only once have I been disappointed.  Food portions are great...chef is funny and skilled.  Tonight, had the Geisha Special and it was delicious yet again."}
{"text":"We eat here alllllll the time. They have amazing sushi and the wait staff is so friendly!"}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good things about this place but I wasn't impressed. The food was okay but the service was not that great. We were seated immediately but we waited over 20 minutes to order.   No one really checked on us after dropping off the drinks. There were only two other tables there. So I was confused about the wait. The sushi was yummy! Aside from that we ordered lunch entrees that had stale rice and cold noodles. Most likely will not come back."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place great for date night or night out with friends and have amazing food great cooks"}
{"text":"Hands down THE best Japanese Steakhouse in Las Vegas.  The staff is super attentive and thoughtful, they are on the ball!! They had great suggestions, and paid careful attention to make sure we were happy. The show was super cute and had all the fireworks to make it a great night!

The food OMG the food...I had the Geisha Special, which had Filet Mignon, Lobster, Shrimp, and Chicken.  The Filet was super tender high quality beef, melts in your mouth! Best shrimp ever, even my boyfriend loved it and he DOES NOT like seafood besides sushi (weird I know!).  That special also came with the house sake, which had the perfect amount of potent w/o the getting you fucked up too quickly and hurling your dinner (which would be a waste).  The special also comes with an option of whichever appetizer on the menu. I had the shrimp tempura, which were perfectly crispy, not greasy, great quality shrimp (again). The mushroom soup had excellent beef broth flavor that I thought I can only get from my mother's home cooking. The salad had this interesting gingery sauce on it that really packed a punch.  The fried rice is incredibly good. Definitely worth the $35

With any entree you order from Geisha House you get a soup AND salad, and fried rice. Their prices for entrees ranged from $17 - $35, but it's pretty much all inclusive so it's more than reasonable for the quality of food, ambiance, and service!"}
{"text":"Ryan is great ,food is great he is very funny been going there for years. Highly recommend  this place"}
{"text":"Wow went to order the lunch special to go it would have been my second time ordering. I gave it another try after experiencing bad sushi there a few years ago. Like I was saying I'm writing this as I'm on hold on the phone for 10 minutes now. I'm hanging up and never giving this place my money. Especially after I just read the roach review. Oh 11 min and still counting up.....LOL Done with Geisha House forever!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered our dinner from the sushi bar.  The ginger salad and our tempura sushi were incredible.  I definitely will be coming back because the sushi, hibachi, and staff are amazing. 

The only issue I had was because the person over the phone said the kitchen would be open for service upon our arrival. We arrived at 3:30 PM and was told by the waitress that the kitchen wouldn't open until around 4:30 PM.  We were not looking to have sushi as our only part of our dish and to ask us an hour later if we'd like to order from the dinner menu was slightly off putting. 

I think that the issue with the kitchen time should be included in their business hours."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I love Geisha house!!! They have incredible food at reasonable prices. They sit you down quickly and serve you in a timely manner. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Got here for a work function/ get together. Food was great, bartenders are warm and the hibachi/table top was great. We were smashed but the atmosphere was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Im not much of a sushi person, but I loved sitting at the sushi bar and having the sushi chef give me so much one on one attention to find something I like (success!). This is now our go-to sushi spot. We werent really fans of the main entree menu and havent tried the hibachi yet, but the sushi and their sushi chefs are awesome!"}
{"text":"If you like table cooking this is a great place. Brought my daughter, girlfriend and her kids here. Food was great but the kids loved the table chef that puts on a show."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, we ordered and ate but then my baby, who was a month old at the time, started having gas and crying non stop. I got embarrassed and asked for the check half way through dinner. (I was an agitated momma) and they were very prompt. 

They thought I was leaving because of their service and gave me my last sushi roll for free. I assure you that's NOT the reason, and I told them it was my baby acting up. They do great service, very customer oriented. 

The reason why I took a star away was because there was a lady (maybe the manager) and she would continuously walk by and stare at me. I have social anxiety and this made me really really uncomfortable. I thought she was watching me and it made me creeped out. I don't want to be watched while I eat your food, just ask me later please."}
{"text":"Food was great. Our Teppanyaki chef, Chris, was great. He did a good job dealing with the obnoxious people who were also seated at our table. The drinks were good, but our server took way too long to bring them. He seemed disorganized.  he was really nice though. The food was great enough to have us come back."}
{"text":"it's Valentines day and we decided to try something new. 

it's a really cute place. Kinda reminds me of Benehanas but BETTER quality in food. We had to sit in the grill area even tho I wanted to be seated at a table but it was a 45 minute wait. Good thing we got seated with fun cute couples. Our chef was delightful. The food was really good and flavorful. had a Blue sapphire cocktail which was so good. The couple next to me let me try their Green Apple Sake which was delicious! 

Over all a good experience. Only bad thing was we got there almost closing and towards the end they were practically pushing us out the door."}
{"text":"Went to dinner on a Sunday night & the customer service was excellent. The waitress gave great suggestions & made sure me & my dinner date were fine every chance she could. The food was great to my liking. I will be sure to come back soon."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday night. We were the only people in the restaurant. Service was fast and friendly. The chef was really good, funny and did some awesome tricks. Everyone at our table of 4 was pleased and had plenty to eat. Get hibachi steakhouse!"}
{"text":"How could one not want to sit and enjoy the company of your friends and family while a super talented and personable hibachi chef cooks you guys fresh made to order good merely a couple feet from your face"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The drinks are amazing! As well as the food. The staff is wonderful, I would definitely recommend this place. They are kid friendly. My favorite item on the menu is the rice!! Simply amazing! You must it out!"}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon for Geisha House and decided to use it tonight. As soon as we walked in we noticed we came on homecoming night so all of the hibachi tables were booked. We decided to sit at a booth across from the LED wall behind the sushi bar showing football, bonus! Our waitress, Nina, was extremely friendly and very knowledgable about the menu. We ordered the Geisha special, steak shrimp lobster and chicken. As well as the 90% roll recommended by Nina. Finishing off with green tea crème brûlée. Everything was delicious! The entire experience felt as if we were in a restaurant at a high end hotel. We were so impressed we asked for the manager, Jay,  to compliment them. We will definitely return. Thank you Geisha House."}
{"text":"After hearing about the Geisha House from several friends who've been there numerous time, I decided to take the family there for a teppanyaki dinner.  The soup was flavorful and the main course was very tasty (filet, chicken, shrimp, and scallops).  The salad had too much dressing and the dressing itself wasn't as good as many of the other Japanese restaurants.  The fried rice was tasty but I didn't care for the ton of pink paste (butter and or lard, I guess) that went into it.  It just looks unappetizing when your food is not red but pink.  

The staff was friendly and the restaurant was nicely kept.  The price was commensurate with other teppanyaki restaurants and the quality of the food was definitely above average.  If they lost the pink paste, I would be more inclined to try it again."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The bartendar, Robert did a very good job. He checked on us frequently and made sure our food was as we ordered and our drinks were not empty.  The ambience was definitely geared toward the football crowd which did cost them a star but I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sit at the sushi bar with Chris! He goes above & beyond with customer service, very knowledgeable & friendly. I have a great experience every time I'm here!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE AND WAY OVERRATED. We went there for Valentine's Day this year and the first thing that our chef said to us was that he was new which I suppose we were supposed to take as an apology that he was about to burn all of our food. He put the lobster on the grill first cook it for a little while and then set it aside and then proceeded to cook the chicken the shrimp and the beef and then he started to cook the lobster even more, which made for a rubbery mess. The shrimp was burnt my steak was overcooked and extremely small. I told the waiter that everything was bad to just ok and he completely ignored me. DO NOT GO HERE if you value your money and your taste buds."}
{"text":"Food was good but I was a bit disappointed to look up and see how dirty the ceiling and air duct vents, one of the vents is direct above where they prepare the sushi."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Nothing special. Compare it to a Benihana. The service is very slow. We had to repeat our orders several times. Somehow it took 20 minutes to find steamed rice. 

This would have been a solid three star experience but for the temperature. The restaurants a/c is not sufficient to keep up with the grills. The tables are extremely uncomfortable.  Legs were extremely hot and every other guest I saw had a hot yoga sweat going.  Extremely unpleasant."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Geisha House. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu and offered many suggestions. The food was great and the entertainment at the habachi grill was even better!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! The food is so subpar and very overpriced. Thy charged us $10 for a small side of rice! The experience was very boring and not worth the high price at all."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy! My family and I always enjoy our hibachi experience here. Staff is on point with their service and very professional. A bit on the pricy side but nothing we're not used to for hibachi style dinner. It's worth it."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and everything was amazing. We started out at the bar and I tried the Sake Sangria that was a great start and then we moved to the tapanyaki table I received the japanese lasagna appetizer which was very good too. Then James the Cook started his show and I mean we had a blast. He was funny and entertaining and cooking all sorts of food for the entire group at the table. We had a fabulous time. We cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal here last night!  The food and service was fantastic.  Our chef, Dylan, had only been working there 2 weeks but he had some of the best tricks we'd ever seen.   The decor is also really pretty and interesting.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was really pricey and also freezing cold.  It was a cold night but they should have cranked the heat more i had my jacket on for the first part of the meal.  Nonetheless I would highly recommend this place.  I haven't been to the other locations, but this one nailed it with the food.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here on an anniversary celebration of my in-laws and we had a BLAST! Live chef or dinning option, but for the most part, we had the Live Chef! He was Amazing. Onion Volcano fire thing he dis was lovely. It reminded me of Home. Home in Hawaii! It was a smaller gist of it. Pretty cool, but the cooking basically was Great! We enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE experience. Came in with family from out of town, we wanted to give them some sort of entertainment while they ate. Our server was BEYOND rude, she argued with us the entire night. We had asked from the very beginning to split checks. My mother has just had gastric bypass surgery so she really can't eat a whole lot (& i literally mean she cant eat more than 5 bites) so her and I were just going to split something, so the server said we had to pay an extra $10.95 to split, we said ok That was fine. But when our food arrived, 5 of us had to split ONE 6 oz filet mignon, one chicken breast, and one lobster. So we paid an extra 11 dollars per person to get extra rice and vegetables that we never received because the other group of people across from us wanted extra rice and meat so all of our portions were given to them. So now we were not only
Paying for extra food we didn't receive but other guests were getting our food.  Our waitress did not ask us once how we were doing but she certainly managed to ask her other table about 6 times and has no problem taking shots and doing sake bombs with another table. The chef was fabulous, Joseph, I believe was his name. He was excellent. So then when we asked for our checks to be split, again, the waitress threw a fit and told us FLAT OUT no. So we asked to speak to the manager, JI, he was not helpful either. Not to mention we couldn't even understand half of what he was saying. He fought with us as well although he at least did try to make things right for us in a sense. We said we were not going to pay the gratuity to the server because she was terrible but instead wed like the tip to go to the chef. Not sure if that happened but I hope so. We were not looking for a free meal or anything like that all but the gesture would have been nice, instead we just left all pissed off. Needless to say, we will not be back. Not to this location at least. Terrible terrible service and management. Awesome chef though!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was okay. Everything was just okay. Except the plastic silverware they gave us for the soup. Paying $130 for 3 dinners and being given plastic silverware is not okay."}
{"text":"Benihana who?  Never again cause I love me some Geisha House!  

Made a reservation for my husband and I along with another couple for a Sunday night.  We were on time and the place was pretty deserted (which was nice).  We were seated immediately at a hibachi table and our drink order was taken.  

I opted for the chicken dinner and my husband went with the filet mignon.  Fair warning:  it's A LOT of food.  They start with a flavorful beef based broth-type soup with mushrooms, fried onions and scallions.  Next is a small salad with a light, tangy vinaigrette (I suppose) dressing.  It was a nice accompaniment to the soup.  The chef then started his show on the grill and it did not disappoint.  He made fried rice (you pay extra for that at Benihana, by the way) and grilled mushrooms, onions, zucchini and bean sprouts.  I don't know what that pink special sauce is but they need to bottle and sell it!  It gives everything an amazing flavor and, um, hello?  It's pink!!!  My husband is allergic to shrimp so he did our entrees next and then the shrimp last. The chicken and meat were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  

The food was excellent.  There's just something about watching food being cooked right in front of you that makes it taste better.  Am I right?  Like I said, they give you lots of it - I had to give about half of mine to my husband to finish.  The chef was wonderful - he did all the standard tricks and had a fun personality to boot.  The service was excellent - our drinks were refilled without having to ask and we were doted upon the entire time (the benefits of an empty dining room, I suppose?).

The restaurant itself is clean and updated from the last time I had been there (years and years and years ago).  They've separated the hibachi tables from the sushi bar so there's a nice distinction between the 2 dining areas.  The hibachi booths are comfy and roomy and the bathrooms are clean (always a non-negotiable in my opinion).

The only drawback that I saw was the potential for a long wait time should we not have had a reservation.  There was only one chef that night and it was pretty slow in there but if a walk in party had arrived, I imagine they would have had to wait for the chef to finish with us and that would have made for a long wait time.  My suggestion?  Make a reservation if at all possible.

I honestly feel like this place blows Benihana out of the water.  The food was better, the service more attentive and I kid you not, our total bill at Geisha House was HALF of what it was at Benihana.  Go to Benihana once for the experience (it really is an incredibly gorgeous restaurant) but go to Geisha House again and again for what's really important - food, service and value."}
{"text":"\"I absolutely love this place!\" The experience was wonderful and the environment is nice and chill. \"The cocktails here are good too!\" The service is great as well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I started coming here recently, and really enjoy the food.  He usually orders the Geisha special, and I order sushi.  No complaints about the food whatsoever, everything is always consistently good.  But it is a little awkward when my food comes out about 10 minutes before his...he gets to sit there and watch me scarf down my food (I'm a fast eater) then when his food arrives, I get to watch him eat.  Service is attentive and our drinks are never empty.   Tonight he didn't get the soup or salad which is supposed to come with his meal.  We didn't say anything, but were a little pissed.  I love the salad, and usually eat that while he eats the soup.  But tonight, nada.  Haven't tried desserts yet, as we are always full from the meal.  Beautiful décor and the booths are spacious.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"First off, I have to say that this is the most beautifully designed restaurant I have ever been to. I was totally in awe and could not stop looking around at the decor throughout dinner. My waiter noticed and informed me on a couple of pieces, including the crazy expensive LED TV behind the sushi bar. 

The food was also very good and the presentation was great! Our waiter was very attentive and offered suggestions. We did not have the hibachi and instead just ordered off of the menu. The food was very good and reasonably priced, we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"AC is broke again they say. Not sure it's ever worked!! The owners are to cheap to fix it clearly. I have NO IDEA how anyone sits at the teppanyaki tables. THE ONLY reason we come in here is because of Cody, the bartender!  He's the best.  If I owned a business I would soooo steal him to work for me. He's very efficient and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Naked Sushi Event:

NEGATIVE 100,000,000 stars.  I should have given my $$ to some homeless guy.  

The naked models had good plastic surgeons though. Very interesting... but don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Quick Look: Average Sushi and Sub-Par Service. 

In Depth Review: Made the 20+ minute drive from the other side of the valley to try a \"new\" place on Thursday, May 15th.  We arrived at 7:30pm and were greeted by a lovely Geisha and seated at a nice table on the patio. Was surprised how empty the massive space was. The busiest part was the bar and patio area. It was a younger looking, \"happy hour\" type crowd. 

After being seated by a nice little waterfall feature we were handed multiple different sized menus w/o and explanation as to what they were all about. Was a bit confusing. We sat at that table for a few minutes w/o being greeted or being offered water or having our drink order taken. A male waiter shows up and asks if our waitress has stopped by the table yet, we say \"no\" and he say's he will take our drink order. After he departs with the order a female waitress shows up and asks if she can now take our drink order. Huh? We got a signature Ginger Mojito and a Sake Sangria (made with cucumbers). Drinks were delicious although my hand was sticky from the spillage on the outside of my glass. 

Asked the female waitress what \"specials\" they had that day and she could not answer me. Had to leave to check on the specials and come back and tell me. This is a big restaurant so it's not like this just took a minute, a few minutes would pass so she could walk all the way to the kitchen. 

So we place our order - (salmon sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, tuna sashimi, Japanese lasagna roll, spicy tuna roll and the special that included steak, scallops and tuna over a bed of lettuce in an \"orgasm\" sauce). I had initially attempted to order a few fish items listed on the menu and was told they were not available (example: amber-jack). Asked for at least three different items and was shot down. That's confusing, remove them if not available & place the specials somewhere the customer can see them. 

Food starts to arrive all at once, bad timing. I like my sushi restaurants to time the plates so that they are not all sitting in front of me. Tuna sashimi was \"fishy\" and my wife refused to eat it after the first bite. All the sashimi pieces lacked that fresh fish \"snap\" I find at the better sushi restaurants in the city. On a positive note they do give generous pieces of fish at a good price. 

The sushi rolls certainly looked nice when they arrived. The rice was hard and not the soft, sticky rice you will find at a fancy sushi house (Yellowtail, Nobu). The hard rice caused my nice looking sushi rolls to fall apart when I tried to pick them up with the chopsticks. Rice tasted like the low budget stuff you buy in bulk at a warehouse like Sam's Club. The special that day was steak, scallops and tuna over lettuce in an orgasm sauce. Was presented well, a huge portion but was given a plate full of the hard heel pieces of the lettuce that nobody eats & the steak was overcooked and tough like leather. The Japanese Lasagna roll was the tastiest item we had, certainly recommend that item. 

As we finished the items and pushed our dirty plates to the other side of the table, nobody came to remove the dirty plates. They just sat there, obviously empty, as multiple employees (and managers) walked by the table and never removed them. The removal of the dirty plates seemed to be an issue as our waitress went to get the check, took our credit card and cashed us out all while the dirty plates still sat on the table in front of us. I finally asked a busboy to remove them and let him know they had been sitting there 20+ minutes. He was going to walk by the table w/o removing them when I stopped him. He apologized & blamed the dish removal on the bar staff. 

Had other service related issues while we were dining, like: a runner showing up and dropping off a plate meant for our neighbors at another table, waitress forgetting to come and take our drink order when she said she would: \"be right back,\" waiter grabbing drink order and forgetting to put the drink order in, two drinks showing up when it should have been just one - etc. Just seemed like they had a lot of service related issues. Got a very amateur vibe & the two of us were spun with all the errors & lack of service over site. Think some additional training is necessary and that goes for whomever is leading this confused group. 

Summary: was not worth the long drive and too be honest, we were a bit disappointed. The mediocre plates may have been over looked if the service was top-notch? Too much confusion going on here. Beautiful restaurant and space. Hopefully management & the owners take notice and bring this place up to par with the fine sushi establishments in the city. You have great potential w/ that location!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun and entertaining for the entire family. We love the decor and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"The food is always all right. But it is insane how bad the customer service is! The hostesses are literally eating a chocolate icy bar. And rude. Thanks for that. How unprofessional can you get?"}
{"text":"The food is good and teppan is always fun.  I like the pink rice they make on the flat top, too.  Even though their tricks are the usuals, they're still very entertaining."}
{"text":"Meal was great but don't think about using a group on !   This place does not take geisha house vouchers"}
{"text":"I *LOVE* this place!  I used to go to the old one on Durango/DI all the time.  The Geisha Special is where it's at.  Miso soup, Salad, Appetizer (I like the shrimp tempura), Filet, lobster, shrimp, chicken and fried rice...oh my!  I usually split it with someone and STILL have leftovers.  The ambiance is nice, the chefs are entertaining and the food is awesome.  I just wish I could figure out what the heck is in the salad dressing...mmmmm..."}
{"text":"I don't think this location has as good of service as the location on Desert Inn and Durango but the food is great.  Our waitress was young, dumb and slow.  She pretended not to speak very good English and kept forgetting our sake, salads, etc.  This is the first time I've ever had a problem with service at Geisha, so I won't rate it too low.  Also, you should tell them it's someone in your group's birthday cause the Tempura Banana desert is YUM!"}
{"text":"i've been to all kinds of hibachi places but geisha house is what's up.

get the geisha house special!

order the flavored sake, mango or watermelon
it's a little bit extra but it tastes like HEAVEN!!!

i'm already craving the pink garlic ginger they put in the fried rice."}
{"text":"I was really really impressed with this place! I'm a vegan, and found the menu to be very very accommodating. The hibachi chef was seriously amazing and really went out of his way to make sure I had everything I could need and want. My boyfriend and I split the meal and they do charge an additional 11.95  for the extra soup and salad. There wasn't a very large wine list by the glass, however what I did try, was very good and fairly priced. The cocktail menu was interesting. We ordered the coconut goblet as well. Not very good or strong, for the price. We put an extra shot in it and that helped. They did free birthday ice cream for my cousin which was awesome and they also allow each person to check In for the mochi on yelp... So heads up! The only down fall was happy hour was only at the bar and patio, and even though we were doing hibachi, there was a few rolls and appetizers we would of liked to try. My cousin was under 21 and wasn't allowed in the bar area even before our reservation. Maybe a little more accommodation for that woulda earned them five stars. Either way, I'll definitely be back. Everyone loved their food and it was definitely worth the bill!!"}
{"text":"The first time I came to Geisha, I came on a Sunday with my sister. We honestly wanted the honey toast but we just ordered some sushi as well. 
We got the \"I Don't Want It\" and I think the spider rolls. 
Well I really liked the interior and so I assumed the service would be excellent. It was okay. There was one man who helped us the whole time but after a little while, it was like he forgot about us so we had to wait a bit for the check. Anyways, my first experience was like around 4 stars because the honey toast was amazingggg
Recently when I came, it was for dinner before prom. This was a couple weeks ago on a Saturday, an hour after they had opened. There was only the four of us and we all don't demand much at restaurants anyways so it shouldn't have been weird as it was that day. 
To begin with, my friend and her date ordered something from the main menu but three times ordering, the waitress tells them that whatever they ordered no longer existed on the menu. 
Really? Three different menu items? Out? 
Well my friend's date got kind of frustrated so he ordered the pork tonkatsu but they were out of that so he went with the chicken tonkatsu. 
For my date and I, we ordered the P.I.M.P, the Hulk, the Spider rolls, the Harujuku girls, and the Creamy Horse. But then I forgot that I ordered the creamy horse and told them I didn't order it and at the same time, they accidentally made a second plate of the Harujuku girls rolls which made me more confused. 
I thought it was someone else's order but there was one family and they were at the hibachi. Anyways, the waitress was irritated with us at this point and so we just took the rolls and just ate what we could. 
Then another man came to constantly check up on us afterwards and I liked him way more. The waitress just kind of seemed like she wanted to avoid our table so once again, took a little while to get the check. 
I mean the food is very good but service is inconsistent and some of employees just don't seem to have the patience. 
I will give this place another try but maybe I'll do the hibachi next time."}
{"text":"The happy hour deals were what my friends would go for. They had a great selection of food items and several different drink items on there happy hour menu. That's what I mean when I said \"HAD\". They took off a lot of food selections and drinks items so you don't have as much to choose from. Very disappointed in that. Some of the sushi rolls are much smaller then the used to be. If they want repeat business then they should return to there old menu. Just a thought"}
{"text":"Geisha!  Wow!  

I never realized what a great place to go to for Sashimi!  I always thought it was just a nice Teppanaki house.  But we sat at the sushi bar new years eve and had a great time getting served by the head chef.  Squid & Octupus really goood!  Nice house Sake too and I generally don't like sake.

Nice job by the friendly staff!  See you again."}
{"text":"Chef Eddie is the best!!! Never overcrowded, always delicious. Beware: Martinis are strong"}
{"text":"Drove in here for some lunch after my am workout. We were the only customers  save 1 lady who was waiting for her party to arrive. We were promptly seated, and given menus. Had a little snafu w/ the wee one and the bathroom, but our waitress was completely patient and understanding! Lil one had the Chicken Udon, I had the pork tonkatsu bento box (complete with tempura, salad w/ginger dressing, 4pc cal roll, and rice), along with a side of edamame.

Don't know the edamame was a little underdone still, but the pods were falling apart..normally doesn't happen, but didn't ruin the meal for me. Rest of the food was tasty. Typical tempura but still light and tasty. typical pork tonkatsu, nothing that is super outstanding, but noticed they will drizzle the pieces with the tonkatsu sauce, and mayo in a neat criss cross pattern. 

Now I have to give the waitress, Sierra, mad props! I mean talk about customer service. She was top notch! From seating us, til we left she was spot on for impeccable timing in attending to our needs! While waiting for our food to come out - we got the customary soup. Three groups came in for their lunch, but Sierra was managing it all very swiftly without missing a beat!

Tiny annoyance to note - the bus guy (young man - college age from the looks of it) - kept popping out of the kitchen every couple of minutes checking on tables. Granted with only 4 tables occupied not much work to do, but still - doesn't require checking on us so frequently! That's my observation not enough to lower a star, but something for management to take note of maybe to impart on this young man. :)

Thank you Geisha House once again for yummy food!"}
{"text":"Pink fried rice is awesome! And lemon butter shrimp is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with a big group of friends. We didn't even get drinks, when I opened my menu a big roach crawled out of my menu and onto my friend's menu. We just got up politely didn't make a scene and left. As we were leaving the waitress asked what's going on we told her, and instead of asking where, she said sorry like this situation happened before. Ruined my whole idea of this place.

Don't think I will ever go back here."}
{"text":"This place doesn't understand customer service. They are closed for teppan at 240 or whenever is convenient and don't open till 5. They don't list that on their website or when u call. Also when u call no one answers. When we walked in they told us tough luck we can't help you. I'd rather eat at one of the better customer service places in or next to this place."}
{"text":"No star review here--horrible experience.  We had to wait an hour despite having a reservation.   Drink orders had to be requested, one soda took two hours to receive and water was never filled.   One chef had to share two tables because there was not a table large enough to accommodate our party of ten (no mention of this at our reservation.)  Scallops were raw,  salad was swimming in dressing or it may have been soup.   Appetizers never came and the Geisha specials did were missing lobster.   And a mystery punk sauce was used on all the meals,  the chef wouldn't advise what was in it but it liked like the meat filter stuff you hear mc Donalds uses.   \"Manager\" (not sure how this person qualified as a manager as he was a large part of the service issues) offered a15% discount for our troubles.   This was the worst birthday dining experience ever... worst dining experience ever."}
{"text":"This time i tried their hibachi for dinner... Yummy...  Especially with friends... It was fun..."}
{"text":"Food here was great, steak was tender and cooked just the way we wanted. Our chef Edgar was great!! Lychee Martini was nice as well. Just wished I could have had the honey toast...it's cool, next time."}
{"text":"WOW!!! chef Jeff has to be the best chef i have had cook for me and my friends in a long time! besides for the good looks he is professional and his food is amazing! great personality and great routine! i have to say his conversation shows that Chef Jeff has a lot of experience and good head on his shoulders, thanks for such a great experience Jeff ! we will be loyal to Geisha House!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful! We did the teppanyaki. We had to wait 30 min which is ok but the rest of the restaurant was empty. They should really have more teppanyaki stations. The food was good. Not my 1st pick for teppanyaki but wouldn't mind going there again."}
{"text":"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW! I tried this place for the first time yesterday. My girlfriends wanted to do a cute little happy hour date and we wanted to pick a spot that we all have never been before. This place was suggested.. Upon arrival we waited in the front for about 8 minutes to not be acknowledged. That was the first strike. I had to walk to the back where the bar area is located to ask for some service. Anyways we were told we can be seated wherever we wanted because the happy hour is in the bar area. The ambiance of the place is great I will give them that much. Nice big red couches and some high table tops. No complaints there. Once we found a nice spot we were ready to order! I took a peek at the menu prior to arriving so I had a good idea of what I already wanted. The first round of drinks were great, however the fact that it took approximately 15 minutes for a drink to arrive is unacceptable in my eyes. They weren't busy at ALL so I couldn't understand why 1 drink was taking as long as it was. I asked our server what the problem was and he had no answer other than it's being made? Oh yeah? hmm okay well.. I have never been to a place where the FOOD comes before the drinks? Super annoying! I could see the table out on the patio must've had an issue last night as well because of the commotion that was going on when the manager approached them. All in all I may or may not return.. Food was great but the service was terrible. Having knowledgeable staff is crucial in the restaurant business. I asked about the coconut shrimp on the happy hour menu and questioned how many they came with. The server said oh it comes with 4 and then they came out with 3 and his explanation was \"oh because they are big so they only gave you 3\" well I sent them back because that's ridiculous. The free mochi desert that comes with the check in was okay. There were 3 of us and two of us got the mochi cut into 4 pieces with toothpicks and one of us it was cut in half with no toothpick so I guess they assumed my friend was suppose to use her hands? Ahh way too many inconsistencies and it's sad because this would be a nice local happy hour spot to attend on the regular... They have to get it together.."}
{"text":"The people here are 100% the best here and care about requests like how I requested no Lemon since I'm allergic o them. I've had a few dishes already and love them all and the best part is the kids love the \"Fire shows\". We love the \"Volcano Train\"! It's just great!  I must say the Shrimp is outstanding and the magic ingredient makes it PINK! The steak just rocks because of its \"competition\" to chew. The rice also has the PINK ingredient as well as some healthy egg and more. The appetizer soup is the BEST!!!! It's got mushrooms, some-kind of noodles, and ??mini green unions??"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had in the valley (and I've tried a LOT) We will definitely be coming back. Good prices, good service, fun atmosphere, and great food."}
{"text":"love this place. I normally stop by at least once a week during happy hour for drinks and sushi. the staff is extremely friendly and helpful, i really like how the manager, Jon, always stops by to make sure everything is up to par. Fish is always super fresh and the drinks are awesome. its a beautiful restaurant as well, everything is clean, new and inviting. i definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Wow!  Talk about high prices for a shopping center!  The sushi was very good and the service was excellent!  Checked the dinner menu and the hibachi dinner prices were as high as if you were on the strip!  My husband doesn't eat sushi so he would have a fit if he looked at the menu and saw the prices for the sushi and hibachi.  Also, the dinner menu is very limited.  As I said, I really enjoyed the sushi but doubt that I will back."}
{"text":"Hmmm. I'm not sure how to say this but I have to officially put this restaurant in the category of pure entertainment eats only. \"What does that mean\", you ask! That means when I come here it's not to spend a heap of money for ridiculously flavorful food, but more so to be entertained by the wonderful chefs and enjoy a decent meal. 

That said this was my first time at this location and I was celebrating a friends birthday! At first sight I was pleased to be \"greeted\" by a giant pikachu bear! Pretty cool! There was approximately 12 of us and I really give it to the restaurant for having everything ready! The seating area was big enough for at least 20 guest. There was 3 grills attached to the area,  but to my surprise the talented and talkative chef Om only needed 1! 

Now the food we ordered the geisha special that included shrimp tempura, salad, a soup, veggies, rice, chicken, shrimp and filet! I subbed shrimp instead of lobster btw! 

The tempura and sauce was good! It was very crispy with very sweet sauce! The salad was just ok and I didn't care for the soup it was very plain yet salty. For the proteins they were just that nothing tantalizing my tastebuds. Sort of reminded me of meal prep... plain and to the point. The rice was tad disappointing, it was just a tad undercooked and had that after crunch that not everyone likes, but I guess it beats mushy rice! The veggies were well cooked.

For the food, it was not nasty but it also wasn't delicious. The service stars Chuck and chef Om were great and very accommodating!  That factored in with the entertainment and ambiance 4****"}
{"text":"Well. I didn't expect this type of experience. We came for lunch with my mom and my 5 months old child.  When we came in nobody met us, and we were waiting for minute or two, even though it was almost empty in there. Just couple tables busy, and nobody on hibachi area. We ordered hibachi, rib-eye and filet mignon. Asked for well done and some pieces turned out medium rare. The hibachi chef wasn't much entertaining, he just made the volcano from onions and the train sound with the same onions. All other time he was silent, just cooking. That's it. My mom is visiting me from another country and it was her first hibachi grill experience - ruined! And it seemed like the waiter and the cook, nobody spoke good english. On everything I said or asked they were waiving \"Yes\" with their heads. Even when I was asking a question like - Where should I put a stroller, so it wouldn't be on their way? - no answer (just waving head) WTH? We also ordered special rolls to go (Hulk and salmon lovers) which were nothing special at all. Very simple. After all when I saw the check, I was shocked, because it didn't worth even half of it. I think I'll never come back. I felt like nobody were waiting for us, like all the waiters were having a chat with each other, and we were just not on the right time. Honestly, I had this feeling like I'm inside the cafe which is still not open and all workers were doing things which they would do without people being there. Well. We were there, and we didn't like it. If the restaurant is not completely full it doesn't mean that we are not people. P.S. The restroom looked dirty also. So, so disappointed..."}
{"text":"Let me first say we made a reservation for 12 of us for my daughter's graduation almost 2 weeks in advance, so they were very aware we were going to be there at 2pm. I was told we would be the last table before the \"hibachi\" chef was off and we were fine with that.

When we arrived, they weren't busy so that was good, everyone was seated, drinks gotten and orders taken. So the cooking part\" show is supposed to start. YEAH RIGHT..... 

The chef barely said anything to us the entire time. The only interactive thing he did was make a heart out of the rice and throw the spice shaker and catch it once or twice. He banked a beat with his utensils and said \"alright\" a lot. But that's it. NO INTERACTION, NO JOKES, NADA! His whole routine lasted  maybe 45 minutes and we had to remind him my son had steak and lobster, and he was like oh yeah, yeah I have it right here, threw it on and did a volcano, and threw the volcano in the trash after.

The food was good which is why they get 2 stars, but the show was the worst.Next time, we go back to Osaka!

For $350 I expected much more"}
{"text":"This is the second time we ate here. I don't remember much of the first, I think my daughter was still baby and was fussy that night so we didn't stay long. Anyways, this time the restaurant was ok.

The restaurant looks very nice, and it's clean. The chairs are too low for the tables, though. I wasn't the only one who felt like I needed a highchair. The actual high chairs they brought for our toddlers were almost the same height as our chairs, leaving the kids with no chance to see the top of the table, let alone the show. They had to stand on our laps to see anything and I ended up holding a plate at my daughter's level for her to eat.

The service was very good. All the waiters and the chef were friendly and accomodating. We had a young child with us, who was a little scared of some of the flashy parts of the dining show, so the chef toned it down a little for her, but still put on a great show.

The sushi and accompanying appetizers were excellent! Oh, it was sooo good. The rest of the dinner, however, left me a smidgen dissappointed. The chef added a pink paste to everything he cooked. On the one hand, it had an interesting flavor. On the other hand, it made everything taste the same. He may as well have just fried up some pink paste and served us just that. :\

I would go back for the sushi."}
{"text":"Everything was good for lunch specials hibachi from the service/ chefs and food. 

Our chef definitely entertained us and as well as a talented chef. The food was perfectly cooked. Two thumbs up from my belly. 

 The only thing that bugged me was our dish ware most were chipped or cracked/broken yet still served out with our food, why?! That stuff weirds me out incase I eat something or swallow plus it makes the place look downgraded.  

But that other than that I was my experience was good."}
{"text":"I've been here for Teppanyaki  which is stellar .Tonight we just sat at the Sushi Bar...
The atmosphere was good , Scott was awesome , great Sushi and Sake ( Kurosawa ) 

We'll be back"}
{"text":"Had reservations at 7:15 and were promptly seated on time. But I guess they got behind and the chef did not arrive at our teppan table until 8:00.  One salad had too much dressing and mine had none at all.

Many apologies were given for the tardiness and free ice cream was promised and provided...but overall it seemed that most of the tables were getting the \"sorry we're running behind\" routine.  

The ice cream when it arrived had obviously been sitting in the freezer for some time already plated up. Overall its ok...and they were getting ready for their Naked Sushi night, which I see gets mixed reviews. (one of the tables across from us asked for a sushi roll as we were finishing up and they said that they had shut down the sushi bar to prep for the naked sushi night.

In the end, the kids like it, but I can think of better ways to spend 30.00 a head."}
{"text":"I'm only giving my experience last night 3 stars because the food was AMAZING. The wait time however was ridiculous even with our reservation. We had a 8 o'clock reservation and was sat around 8:20 the food took FOREVER. we didn't leave until around 945 and we ended up rushing to eat our meal because it was so late. This is my favorite place to eat and we were celebrating valentines early. It wasn't what I hoped it would be"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and the owner was so nice and accommodating! It was my birthday so he really tried to make it special. He made us a special pomegranate sake that was awesome! The white sauce they call yum yum sauce was a bit different from the other two locations so that was a little sad but overall the meal was great. Would definitely recommend this location bc it is small and intimate and the owner is really hands on and tries to make sure you have a great time! The place is on di so a little past the strip!"}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good, but the tempura, steak, and udon was terrible. Plus, our waitress did shots with the couple seated behind us! Very unprofessional!! Other servers were great."}
{"text":"Took my boyfreind for his birthday. Had fun. Joshua the hibachi master was hillarious. Good times had."}
{"text":"We went here for a friend's birthday...it was great we could make a reservation. The chef was fun and skilled...he kept our table engaged. The downside of this whole experience was the temperature of the room. It was some hot and uncomfortable in there. We kept a menu just to fan ourselves off....this was before the grills were even turned on. The majority of our table got the special...which is great lots of food. I would have enjoyed the meal more if I wasn't so uncomfortable during the entire meal due to the heat. I don't understand how the staff was oblivious to it. After we ordered our food our wait staff was very inattentive. They kept dirty dishes sitting on the bench next to my boyfriend for so long. The chef finally told the staff to do something about it. We had to continually flag them down for drink refills...mostly water because we were so hot.

I loved the food but I don't think I will be returning because I was so uncomfortable during the meal."}
{"text":"I went to the Geisha House and it was just ok. I had their Geisha House Special at the hibachi table. Some of the meal was good and the rest was  ok. Their shrimp tempura was good. Their they use A LOT OF GARLIC BUTTER. If you do not like garlic butter then this is not the place for you. Our cook used sooooo much garlic butter that I started asking \"why so much of this\". It was out of control with the garlic butter, my guest and I had major garlic breath. I will go back for the Shrimp Tempura Only!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, but not the greatest food !!!   We were sitting w/ regulars that wer in a rush so our show was very lacking in tricks and very rushed!!!!  Will not come again!!!"}
{"text":"went there for Shabu Shabu because I read many good reviews.  However they no longer serve it.  Since I was already all the way out there I decided to give the grill a shot.  WOW.  I have eaten Teppanyaki all over the world, but this place was the BEST I have ever had. They have some secret pink substance they put on everything.  whatever it is - is the game changer.  plus our chef KING was very skilled.  did flair moves I had never seen, and cooked my steak MED RARE to perfection.  Forget the rest - this place is the new king of Teppanyaki for me in Las Vegas.    Only down side preventing the 5 stars = they forgot my Sake I ordered with the Dinner special.  And I had to wait to chase THEM down.  Once they take your order they disappear so dont expect attentive service.  Also, they boxed everyone's food except my daughters.  didnt even ask.  so the service gets 2.5 stars.  KING and the food get 5 stars.  Im coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Geisha Special is a good value. Our server was bland and less attentive than we hoped for. Exterior is odd but the inside was quaint and fun. Portion size was large enough for left overs. We had a 6 & 3 year old with us. I wouldn't say the place is kid friendly but they were very patient with us. The hibachi show was a lot of fun for the kids."}
{"text":"Sushi bar is closed now 3-5-18. First time here, but 3 very tasty rolls. Vampire was spicy with tasty crab, Touchdown roll was hot and delicious, and Fat Boy was deep fried goodness. Service was okay, but it was a quiet Monday night, and we had the place to ourselves, so we just asked for what we wanted."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Great experience.  The food was excellent as was the service.  I definitely recommend the Ultimate Shrimp roll.  SOOOOOO good!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Our server even posed in pics with us. Ordered 1 of every sushi, so delicious. Free mochi and a beautiful place to eat. Go here, like NOW. Worth the 45 min drive from Henderson"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for my birthday dinner, based on reviews and pricing of the dishes i was hoping for some good food. I orderd the sealover which was 40$ for some tough shrimp and few pieces of Lobster tail... and dense over saturated rice/vegetables .  My husband choose to point this out to me once we left, but.. it seems that the chef accidently served a plate that was sitting infront of a child who was not suppose to get Sealovers.. in the end we ended up with less seafood because of this..I am really disatisfied with this place..to top it all off the alcoholic mixed drinks were nothing to rave about.  I had high hopes for this place ..unfortunately we will not be coming back.. let me just add that the only good thing about this place is how attentive the waiters  and waitresses are"}
{"text":"It was my wife's and my 35th wedding anniversary last night, and I wanted to take her some place really special. Well, Geisha House Steak and Sushi did not disappoint at all! Everything was PERFECT!!! We were seated immediately with no wait. Our server was promptly attending to us, especially since this was our first time. The show that our chef (Lao) put on was amazing!!! And the food was just as amazing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst experience EVER! Came in with my family for lunch on Sunday. There was 7 of us and the hostess asked us when we walked in if we had a reservation and we told her no. They only had two other parties for the hibachi grill areas (they were dead!). She sat us down and took our drink orders. About 10 minutes later she came back and asked us again if we had a reservation. For the 2nd time we said no. She walked away and spoke with someone which we found odd, but kept looking at the menu. She proceeded to come back to let us know that they couldn't serve us because we didn't have a reservation!!! Not kidding. They sat us down, took our drink orders, handed us menus...and told us to leave after 15 minutes. Still in shock and I have NEVER had this happen! No apologies or anything."}
{"text":"When we're in the mood for some entertainment and teppanyaki, Geisha House is where we go.  This is great place for kids and family.

At the times we've gone it wasn't busy at all... This is usually around 7 or 8pm at night on a weekday.


The last time we were here we took my son for his birthday and he absolutely loved it.  The chefs there are awesome and their tricks are fun to watch.  I really want to try the onion volcano at home!   It was funny to watch them sing happy birthday to him as well.

He had so much fun, after we left he let us know that he wants to be a chef and do what they do.

We've had their Steak and Chicken and it is delicious and worth the price.  The fried rice is delicious.  They have this red buttery sauce they put on everything.  I find that we always take home food, so the food to price ratio is right on.

Our drinks were always full, the staff was extremely friendly, especially to our children, the place is clean and the atmosphere is fun!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I have been coming here for about 7 years now, and we've even eaten here for anniversaries. Let me just say, it's good, but we have often found ourselves in comical situations with the cooks since its a Hibachi grill. I think it's a training ground for the other Geisha house on Flamingo. I'll spare you the details, but it's almost been catastrophic at least 3 times. Needless to say, they've managed to pull it off and enjoyed great dinners after near catastrophes :)! I recommend it if you're looking for great Japanese cuisine , and maybe a little adventure."}
{"text":"Celebrated my son's birthday and really enjoyed the outside hibachi. Felix cooked for us and was awesome!  Really enjoyed the experience and price was good too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Some buddies and I decided to check out the Geisha House primarily because they had an offer on Groupon that offered a decent discount to check out their \"Naked Sushi\" night. The concept sounded pretty interesting, like something out of a Yakuza movie or something...in any case, it didn't prove to be as neat as it sounded.

First off, this restaurant really is on the EDGE of town. We knew that going in to it, so that's not really a complaint, just an observation. Be prepared to drive pretty far if you live anywhere in the Valley other than the Northwest.

We got to the Geisha House and it was pretty busy. There was a small line to get in, maybe five minutes of waiting at the most, and then we were faced with the host. He took out Groupons and told us it would be $5 required gratuity. We said that would be fine, and then he said we had to pay it right then before entering. We begrudgingly paid the man, were each given a drink ticket and a hostess seated us outside on the covered patio.

I was surprised to find that there was no waitress that came and took our drink order. Instead, we had to go inside to the bar, which had a massive line, in order to get our drinks. They didn't even bring glasses of water to the table, so drink tickets had to be used for ANY drink, not just alcoholic ones. I ended up using mine on a bottle of water, and I had to purchase another for $2 after I drank it. Sort of cheesy, if you ask me.

Onto the Naked Sushi bit! In my head, I had imagined that we would have had our own table with a gorgeous naked woman on it with delicious sushi lined up for the taking....this was not so. It was more of a glorified buffet line, where everybody filed around a large circular cooking station in the corner of the restaurant. There were hot items, and in the middle of the line-up were two women with some truly nasty looking sushi laying on their bodies (leaves laid on the skin prevented the sushi from touching their bodies). I tried a bit of each piece and it was terrible! Not to mention that the girls were not exactly attractive and they looked like they wanted to kill someone while they were laying there. The hostess was actually far more attractive than the Naked Sushi girls, which isn't what I would have expected.

The saving grace, or the only grace, of this place were the chicken wings and fried rice. They were pretty tasty and we all loaded up our plates in abundance with those two items. 

This sounded like it would be a good experience online, but proved to be rather disappointing when it came down to it."}
{"text":"This place always has great food. The Hibachi chef (Jason) was also great. My only complaint is that the Hibachi tables are small and they pack them in. Otherwise, I would tell everyone to go."}
{"text":"Tried 3 rolls, don't even remember the names. Wasn't the worst I've ever had, but I'll be making a point to avoid ever coming back here. Bad sushi. Ugh.

So many sushi options in Vegas to give this better than 2 stars, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Best place ever and I will come back again and again, the food was awesome and a great staff, I took my wife here for her birthday and had the best time. I don't know who had the best experience but I had a great dinner and service, 2 thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"10 days later needed a sushi fix. Came back and Francis greeted us, sat us, and remembered us. He remembered 3 of our previous rolls and guessed our drinks too. Great service! I'm a GM for another restaurant, and I'll tell you his service is over the top. Def makes you feel like you belong there. Thanks Francis. See you next week!"}
{"text":"First time visiting a restaurant where you get your food cooked in front of you. Amazing experience. Great, delicious food. Get their Geisha house special dinner. So worth it for about $38. Fun show, welcoming staff, tasty food, good hot house sake."}
{"text":"ASK FOR THE KING! Seriously entertaining dining experience. The \"watermelon\" fried rice is SOOOOOO GOOD. I had the Geisha Special it comes with chicken, filet mignon, lobster, shrimp. Wow the \"KING\" made it such a memorable dining experience for me. He made a volcano out of onions, a heart burn, as well as some \"egg\" rolls. You must try this place as a local or even a visitor :)"}
{"text":"Love this Place!! Food was Delicious..... and Whatever that Pink sauce is... It Really is Yummy!! I  Ordered the Sea Lover Special..... and They were very generous with the Seafood Portions...I ate Plenty and actually left with plenty too.... Perfect Place for Girls Night!!"}
{"text":"The geisha house is always a go too hibachi! It not too expensive and the selection of food is always of flavor and enough to chose from! Sushi or hibachi how can you go wrong. It it usually packed on the weekends therefore I suggest going on the weekday..

I have never encounter a bad night here, the staff can be a little more welcoming or happier/talkative. I'm not sure why this is but they all have great manners etc. 

I always get the steak filet or rib eye which is full of flavor! You always get salad,soup, or rice, stir fry,shrimp and and entree choice of meat! How could you go wrong! I'd like to say your paying for the entertainment as well...

Long story short! Enjoy your time here, it's a great place to experience."}
{"text":"Let me just say that if it weren't for an impromptu invitation to come here and join a b-day party, I would've never set foot here again. I ate here at the sushi bar about 3 or 4 years ago and was not impressed at all. I decided at that time that I would just go elsewhere for sushi when I needed my fix.

Tonight, I decided to open up to this place again and try habachi since I was invited to join a party of 9 other folks celebrating a birthday. I was pretty happy to see that the Geisha Special offered everything I needed in one order: shrimp tempura, soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, chicken, filet mignon, lobster and a choice of drink--all for $35. The chef was entertaining and had a great rapport with us rowdy patrons. The atmosphere of the whole place is just so fun and relaxed. It made a huge impact on the dining experience. The table next to us was not as rowdy since half of them were kids. I can see that the chefs here definitely play off of the crowd they're working with. (We were all adults and there was some maturely suggested things going on during the live cooking demonstration, tehe.)

Not only was it very entertaining to watch being cooked, the food tasted excellent as well. They have this pink \"secret sauce\" that they put on everything and tastes phenomenal. I don't think I've had shrimp or lobster more tasty than what they serve here. I tried to con the chef into telling him I needed to know what was in the secret sauce because I may be allergic to an ingredient, but he didn't fall for it since my poker face was much harder to keep after having a few saki bombs.

Overall, great service and an awesome dining experience that I won't soon forget. And to think I had been missing out this whole time before giving this place a second try. I can't wait to gather a group of folks to have dinner here again soon."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here on a Friday night for the Hibachi part of the restaurant. It has been probably close to 3 years since we've had hibachi style so we were super excited!

Our first impression upon entering the restaurant was that it was really clean, and super modern looking. I kinda got the feeling of entering a nightclub/lounge but when we walked by the lounge area, the grills could all be seen along the one end of the restaurant. 

The grills themselves had a pretty cool view of the restaurant and the bar, kinda overlooking it. Also, there was a huuuuuge projection of the dodgers game being played.

The food was great... We both got their geisha house special which included shrimp, lobster, chicken, and filet mignon steak. It also included soup, salad, fried rice, and a free drink or sake. The fried rice tasted a bit bland to me, but overall I was satisfied with everything.

I think we plan on returning here whenever we're craving hibachi style Japanese food!"}
{"text":"To start, I'd definitely recommend Geisha House out here on North Decatur. It's a nice quiet little place away from the strip. The service was outstanding. Our server, Jeep was very kind and helpful. He was funny and very interactive with us. He definitely made me feel at home and comfortable with the environment. 

We chose to sit at the Hibachi table, where a cook cooks in front of you. This definitely was entertaining as the cook performed many different tricks. This also brings me to the food. It was very satisfying and delicious. I really enjoyed the New York style Steak they had to offer. 

If you're looking for a good place to eat away from the strip, I'd definitely recommend Geisha House."}
{"text":"The seating arrangement is what really ruins this restaurant.  Unlike most Japanese style grills the grills are arranged in a long curve instead of a horseshoe.  The end result was that out of a group of 8 who sat together, it was impossible to talk to someone more than 3 seats away due to the noise.  The chef's banter was also lost on most of the people sitting at the edge of the group, as the grill is centered.  The seating is good for a very large work group if you only want to talk to the people on your immediate sides.  For a more friendly environment, it is awful.  

The food was acceptable, about on par for the price and type of cuisine.   The food is cooked in an order, so you may find yourself finished with the rice and vegetable before the chef gets to the seafood dishes.  The \"signature pink sauce\" was nothing special, just well done fried rice.  

I had  a rare NY strip steak and shrimp.  The steak was a small portion for the price, but an excellent cut of beef.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and delicious.  

For drinks, the \"Ninja\" drink special is a gigantic blue goblet of a mixed drink, that easily serves 2.  It tasted mostly of vanilla rum, overpowering anything else that was in the drink.  The ginger mojito was much better, basically a standard mojito with a piece of candied ginger.  

Service was below expectations.  The chef himself was excellent, working well with our large group.  There was a smaller group of 3 who had been added onto our table, and they recieved very little attenttion at the far end.  Drink service was poor, with the server taking a long time to deliver initial drinks, and only coming by once to ask for additional drink orders."}
{"text":"Just had teppanyaki. Shrimp and veggie with tofu. This place is always solid for great teppanyaki experience.  I find the service is a little spotty but the food and sushi has been pretty consistent. I'm always full when I leave but hungry when I get home. ...I dunno?"}
{"text":"If we hadn't recently gone to Hokkaido, perhaps I would have overlooked a number of things, however we had & it had been a great experience.  Firstly, we had to wear our coats thoughout the meal - our seating area was freezing!  When even the hibachi chef complained, he was told by management that it had something to do with the venting of the cooktop. It made for a very uncomfortable dinner. Secondly, I question the order of the meal. Soup, salad, then fried rice, then the veggies, then proteins?  All separate so the rice was cold before the veggies even hit our plate. The portions were adequate but our chef kept moving food to the trash area of the grill. No one asked if we wanted dessert and no oranges or other sweets were offered. With other similar restaurants nearby, it's hard to recommend Geisha House."}
{"text":"Wow, my first time here recommended by a friend. We got seated at \"Nina\" section and my awesome experience started then!!! She was friendly, knowledge and with a great smile. She started off with drink and ended recommending this amazing Blue Ninja Sakatini and it was \"Good\"!! I don't eat raw, so I ask Nina for recommendation since she had won my trust from the drink. And she exceeded ALL my sushi expectations with all the knowledge she had with EVERY item on the menu. I work in a bank as a manager and must provide excellent service each day, so I expect the same where ever I go. But \"Nina\" had far beyond exceeded my expectation! I would recruit her as my Banker just because she is that good with people. To management- I would promote her soon before someone like me who is always looking for great talent will recruit her one day. Thanks for an awesome night!"}
{"text":"We were deciding between Geisha House & Oh Jah but ended up here. I've been to several different tepinyaki places and this place is overpriced and the portions are small. They give you a whole lot of vegetables and rice, but meat portion are tiny. The fried rice was a bit on the hard side and the filet mignon was nice and tender but had zero flavor. I had to drench it in sauce to taste good. We asked our waiter if they had military discount and she looked at us like we were cheap. She says \"ummm, I don't know. I'll have to check.\" Overall, customer service was ok for the most part, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"This is definitely one my family and friends favorite stop. We love the hibachi! The chefs are entertaining, and amazing. I often bring my 4 yr old boy, and he gets super excited and is entertained throughout the meal. The chefs go out of their way for him.
We have searched high and low for a good hibachi restaurant in the Vegas Valley. Geisha House has exceeded our expectations.
The fried rice and veggies are awesome.
As a side note, if your not willing to spend $30-$40 on dinner, stop in for lunch. It's a modified hibachi & the portions are still large enough to request a doggy bag. The only difference is that the lunch menu does not include a salad, and the veggies are not fresh cut. They are a medley of sorts. A family of 3 for lunch usually runs us about $35, which is the average cost of 1 adult dinner.
This is a must for hibachi lovers!!
The only reason I am not giving them a 5 star is they often blare R&B music, and last time we ate lunch there we asked for them to turn it down. Which they did, and as our lunch date went along, the music slowly crept back up to almost an unbearable level."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!! Friendly staff and the food is always on point! Get here early though to get a good spot on the patio."}
{"text":"This Sushi restaurant is absolutely beautiful! Located where the old Sapporo used to be on Flamingo and 215 you figured this place would be packed. Sadly when we dined here last night there may have been a total of 10 tables occupied. 
Andy and i sat at the bar and the bartender Rob was very sweet and helpful. We ordered a few drinks and a few items off their happy hour menu. The Spicy Salmon Roll was alright, not bad not good. But the Traffic Light Roll was great! We also had an order of the baked mussels, and unfortunately on two occasions there was a piece of black hair in the mussel. even after sending it back and receiving a new one. eh. 
all in all we probably wont be back but im glad we tried out the place. I MISS SAPPORO!!"}
{"text":"Best hibachi place around! Food is always great but my favorite is their rice and miso soup. Their miso soup has crunchy onion bits and it makes the miso soup so much more tastier. Service is always amazing and are really attendant to their customers. Hibachi is always so entertaining no matter who is cooking. Their style is also very different so it's nice to see some variety each time we go. When we go, I always order extra rice, no veggies, with shrimp. Their veggies are great but their rice is AMAZING! I'm a tiny 5'2 114pound woman and I eat everything on my plate. I mean EVERYTHING! Every birthday I have, I always request to come here for dinner and I never have a bad experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service, fun atmosphere, and incredible chef! He did all the tricks with the eggs in the hat, onion volcano, and more! I got chicken and steak and it was exactly how I asked, not too much secret sauce (I think it's just butter but don't quote me), and it was perfect the last few times I went! Went to a similar place  called Osaka downtown and it was amazing, and this place is very close. Definitely recommend, but it's a bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent!  Cody the bartender is the best as well.  My only gripe is that every summer they seem to have air conditioning problems.  I asked the hostess and she said 3 of the 4 units are broken.  It's 100 outside and 85 inside.  This happened last summer too."}
{"text":"Love this location!  I created NAKED SUSHI at Geisha House a few years ago and  I'm glad to see they kept it going since I left.  Food is great and the staff are very nice!"}
{"text":"Went here Monday for my birthday and had a great time.  We made reservations for a hibachi table at this location but was told they didn't have it when we got there.  If not for that I would give 5 stars.  So we waited in the dinning area and ordered appetizers.  When the table was available we were moved over.  Our chef, Dylan, was so nice and funny.  He kept us entertained and the food he cooked was so good.  The chicken and steak were so moist and juicy.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly.  We had the landlover meal but next time I will get the seafood special even though I don't like lobster just to have more of those supple shrimp.  I will request Dylan of course.  He even made a little rice cake with a candle on it for me.  All of the staff I encountered were very friendly and the ambiance is really nice."}
{"text":"Highly recommended!!!! Been going since yearly 80's and the food and service has always been spot on. Have had a few sushi rolls and a hey we're awesome. Coming here for sushi next week! It's not all you can eat and I can eat my share of sushi and then some... but the rolls are priced well and larger than many other places so for the price of what I ate it was about the same as all you can eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Geisha Steakhouse (Desert Inn location) this evening for a post Valentines Day dinner.  The staff was outstanding and the food was outstanding and James was our Chef who was very entertaining.  The atmosphere is cozy and we enjoyed the company of the very young couple who were seated at our table.  We were there early because we don't enjoy crowds and waiting, so there was much attention to our table by the staff.  We both ordered the Geisha Special and the steak and lobster were both cooked to perfection.

We here from Chicago and the Japanese Steakhouse we frequented offered an \"Egg Yolk Sauce\" that was simply delicious.  We were disappointed to find out that the staff at Geisha was not aware of such a sauce.  They were very interested to hear about the sauce and so the best I could find on Google is as follows:

(1 cup mayonnaise (I use safflower mayonnaise because I try to avoid canola oil)
4 egg yolks
1.5 tbsp white miso
about 2 tsp of sesame oil and 1 tsp soy sauce

Combine all that in a food processor. Put it in a bowl in the fridge until it firms back up.

Pan-sear 2 pounds of scallops on one side. You'll be doing this in batches, so when they're done put them on a plate, then reduce the heat to medium-low and put them all back into the pan when they're all seared, making sure that the seared side is up. Spoon the sauce on top of the scallops, and put a lid on the skillet. Cook over medium-low heat for five minutes, until the sauce starts to brown around the edges.)

I really hope  they research this sauce, everyone in the Mid-west seems to be familiar with it and how wonderfully it accents the Teppan-style of cooking.  I also want to mention that the wasabi was outstanding!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time at a hibachi place, food was good, service was prompt and polite. Cooks were fun and inviting"}
{"text":"Geisha special filet chicken and lobster mixed and rice was great. The egg rolls as apps are so delicious and the calamari is good too. 15min drive off the strip worth is. Not your strip prices here."}
{"text":"Not sure which is better: The food or the service! The staff dotes on your every need and the food is prepared fresh at your table. MUST DO!"}
{"text":"I must have ordered the wrong dish based on all the stars! 

Decided on Geisha House because the pork belly was highly recommended. It is no longer on the menu :-(. It was raining so i ordered a bowl of udon which came with vegetables. That was a stretch...  I paid 15$ for a small bowl of noodles in a boring broth and two tempura half pieces of shrimp. 

Its not sitting well :-( maybe i expect too much coming from Silicon Valley - home of many awesome asian soups. 

I might try it again but i will read the reviews first and order the top rated item."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! Make sure you sit at the grill bar!!! Food prepared right in front of you and your party. The 3 meat meal is the best! Steak, chicken & shrimp!!! Oh! And the sake served warm is a perfect touch!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it out to this place and I think I might have just found my Happy Hour most fave spot! 

The outside seating area is absolutely beautiful! Once the sun has gone down, they turn on the cool patio lights and it gives this place such an awesome, relax feel. 

We sat at the sushi bar and ordered a few rolls from their HH menu-all were delicious! Highly recommend the Crazy Horse Roll, total orgasm in your mouth! Tried the Strawberry Martini, which initially was too strong but our fabulous bartender, Ryan immediately fixed it up and made it chuggable ;)

Service was great, establishment was clean fancy shmancy and prices were reasonable. What more can we ask for?

Oh-don't forget to check-in on Yelp for your free Dessert! That too was amaze balls!!"}
{"text":"I came here a few times for Happy hour and I loved the menu. Last week I was there for my birthday party and they changed the Happy hour menu. Only 30% off rolls and some drinks were on happy hour. We were party of 10 and our order took forever. However, the manager ended up giving everyone free drink for the delay. 

I gave 4 stars because I had a good time, the restaurant has a very nice ambience and great for parties. There are also outside seatings and lounges."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place on a whim and I loved it.
I chose to order off the menu vs. the hibachi or sitting at sushi bar.  I got  the P.i.m.p. roll  along with the Kiss with You shrimp and chicken dish.  Everything was good. I like the creative names of the dishes and drinks.  The waitress was very attentive.  And there was no wait to be seated. 

It was early evening on Sunday and there was one birthday and they do sing and go all out for it but it didn't bother me.  I thought it was fun.  Can't wait to go back and try their late night specials."}
{"text":"I love Sushi and was excited when I moved right down the street from this place. First time go there, they were not quiet open for dinner yet. The girl at the door said they still had another 25 minutes, so I said that's fine do you mined if I leave my order with you and in 25 minutes will you put my order in. She said yes I could do that, and I said i'll be back in about 45 minutes to pick it up and that I would be taking it togo. When I got back they had been open now for about 25 minutes, so I figured it should be ready for me to pick up. When I asked the girl at the door she said it wasn't ready yet, so I said ok and went and sat at the bar. While I was sitting there I noticed that the cook was just starting my order. When I finally get my food and I asked for extra sauce, the guy said he already put some in the bag and was rude about it...but did give me an extra sauce. When I got home there was NO sauce in the bag so it's a good thing I got the one from him. So as far as the service goes, they are not very friendly. The food is a bit pricey, but I have to admit it is very good. I've been to this place twice now and both times the service was bad so although the food is good, I will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Yvonne and Felix are out favorites and the best everytime we come here. Highly recommended and the fried rice is the best!"}
{"text":"I would not even give a star for this place!! Horrible service I came all the way from California to try this restaurant and they turned me away and they weren't even closed!!! I showed up at 9:20 pm."}
{"text":"Geisha special is what I go for, for around 45 bucks you get salad, soup, rice, stir fry, chicken, shrimp, lobster, steak.  Usually the chefs are funny which is a plus"}
{"text":"I came to Vegas to visit my parents with my fiancé for my birthday this past weekend....We were at the pinball hall of fame and I had no idea where I wanted to go to dinner...All I knew is that I wanted to go somewhere where I hadn't been before. A quick Yelp search led me to the Geisha Steakhouse.

I called about an hour ahead of time to make reservations and we ventured on our way....It's kind of a sketchy area - as old downtown usually is - and the inside could definitely use an update. They have been open since 1971 and it looks like it. They could take the visual appeal and give the restaurant a much needed makeover to match the quality of the food and service!

We were greeted and seated almost immediately, even though we were about 30 minutes early for our reservation. I loved the seating.....it made it seem authentic plus the seats were very comfortable. They ended up seating another couple with my family which turned out to be great because they were really nice. James was our chef and he was amazing and very attentive! Overall the food was amazing, as was the service, even though they were short staffed. We had a great dinner, great entertainment and made some new friends in the process! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"First time I ate here the food was wonderful. I couldn't wait to come back. This time it was just alright. The best thing the item on the menu was the Japanese hot rocks. The shishito peppers were really unique. They were baked and really good. The service isn't so good. I couldn't figure out who my waiter was. It seems like everyone was kind of just helping. We were catching people as they ran by. This place is okay. I really don't like the service... Which is a big decision maker when I am deciding where to go for dinner... Free mochi for Yelp members comes with two pieces, paid version comes with four....Enjoy!!y"}
{"text":"What a fun time we had. A great places to celebrate our new house. The food was delicious and watching it be prepared was fun for us all. My littlest even tried, and loved, shrimp."}
{"text":"The server was really nice. He helped me out with the menu because I am new here.

Soup is amazing and the salad is yummy too

I ordered the shrimp dinner 

And then the chef came out and the staff here is super friendly."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here after work one day to check it out, and the experience was fantastic! We were greeted and seated by very friendly staff who welcomed us with smiles. Our server, Devi, gave us the idea to get started with some sake bombs, and she was right! The sake was delicious and really loosened us up for the meal. She  was very attentive to us and made sure that we had all of our needs met during our entire meal. Everything that we tried, as prepared by out chef Felix on the hibachi, was delicious! The entire experience was made exceptional by the wonderful service the staff gave us. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a good time at the eastside location of Geisha Steakhouse.  Our chef, Max, was a hoot and he made sure to entertain us the entire time he was cooking.  The location wasn't super nice inside but it was pretty chill and I enjoyed it.  The \"secret sauce\" butter was a nice touch to our food, which was pretty darn good.  We ordered the $35 geisha special and we left with some food to take home!  Love that!  Definitely coming back to this location and bringing some friends with me; too bad they don't have sushi at this location but, hey, it still warrants a good time, sushi or not."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and teppanyaki in a cool nightlife atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is absolute fire! Literally  my boyfriend and I come here and they always remember us! There are great people working here! Eddie, John, and Francis always make us feel welcome whenever we have dinner here! :)"}
{"text":"Thanks Eddie! Everything was delicious! Highly recommended, great hibachi style food, at a reasonable price. Fast service and no wait for a Friday night at dinner time. Awesome for a date, or family dinner."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Such a nice atmosphere. The chefs are quite entertaining. The signature drinks are yummy. I usually order the Geisha Special that comes with a choice of an appetizer (veg tempura, egg rolls, shrimp tempura, or a steak kabobs)a small house saki, a mushroom beef soup, a salad w ginger dressing. The entrée comes w chicken lobster and filet mignon along w the rice and vegetable mixture cooked right in front of you. Oh the best part is the magical secret pink sauce used to season with an extra lil kick!

They also serve sushi at this location I haven't tried it but it looks fabulous!"}
{"text":"This is the oldest place, with the Best Food! No one can come close to the prices and food quality. The Service is always great."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in with my husband this past Friday night. Made a reservation, which seemed like a good idea because we were immediately seated at one of the teppanyaki stations. (If you're bringing in a group, Definitely make a reservation). It was pretty busy, with people waiting outside. 
We both ordered the special of the night; half filet mignon and half lobster. He got the full hot sake and I got a half of their pomegranate sake, which just tasted like pomegranate juice watered down (dangerous perhaps, because I did feel it!). The chef was a lot of fun. Soup and salad came out first, with the salad being your usual fare. The soup was interesting- tasted like beef broth with French's fried onions. I liked it, but it didn't seem very Japanese. Everything else was very good. I would like to add, don't know if it happened to anyone else, but they have this 'special spice' that they add to everything on the grill; looks like pink paste. It makes everything pink. Just a heads up. 
I would go here again, but only after I've tried everything else Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"Oh Vegas, it's been awhile and I sure do miss you! 

I stumbled by Geisha House a few days ago during my long-awaited trip and I'd have to say that everything was stellar! The sushi was fresh, well prepared and the presentation was spectacular. Who doesn't love beautiful food?

Nina was our server and she was simply lovely. I'm very picky and so I usually have a ton of questions and she patiently answered them, anticipated my needs in advance and most of all so personable and friendly! She was attentive, sweet and so funny! I felt like she genuinely cared about how my experience and that made everything even more memorable! 

Until next time Geisha House,"}
{"text":"This little gem, mid hood, was amazing! I would have totally overlooked it if not for my partner. Dont judge a book by its cover. The food was amazing! The seafood was fresh, the steak literally melted in my mouth, no teeth necessary! It was a fun atmosphere. I can say it was an expensive datenight but hey... Im worth it! Thanks Geisha! Thanks Bae!"}
{"text":"Our family has been coming to this location for over 30 years.  Love the food, service and overall feel of the place.  The chefs are fun and the new addition is great.  We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places! The lunch special is the absolute best. Miso soup, salad, and either a specialty roll or regular roll all around $11-$15. Services is always great, the servers are friendly. I have been here about six times and everything from the food to service stays great."}
{"text":"The hostess / waitress was incredibly rude and the food... Although good....was overpriced . I don't mind paying good many if the staff lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"This place is freaking delicious, what ever that pink stuff is that they are putting in the rice, I want that in all my food. Not only is the food high quality but the cooks are always entertaining and sweet! It is expensive so I don't go all that often, but when I do, I go all out. Its the best!"}
{"text":"We found this place from a travel zoo deal. The ambiance of the place is great. We got the 7 course meal and everything was so flavorful and delishish!! We started off with the seafood salad, then asparagus roll, sashimi, lamb, sushi, filet mignon then we paid $5 extra for this honey toast dessert... I dont know which was my favorite... Prob the seafood salad but it all was super good and I recommend it all! Our waitress Devi was great too!!"}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends on a Saturday night place wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Took a while to get seated for hibachi. Wifely was getting aggravated. Ordered some sushi all was drenched in sauce and was sour. Had the hibachi which was ok a little to salty for my taste. 

Don't think I would be back."}
{"text":"Not really like I want.
I went there with my wife for her birthday. I thought we will be have some surprise on it but totally up side down..... Maybe I expect too much. The food ok the chef not very good(no trick) the server kind of not much patient to listen what I want..... 
So that's bad experience for us."}
{"text":"I ordered pick up like I always do. Today I came in to pick it up and the bar tender Cody came out to cash me out. I waited like 20 mins and while he made drinks for another party. Than he bagged my food. I asked if the food that had been sitting on the back of the bar was mine. He said yes. I asked if it's hot because it had been there the whole time I was waiting. He bagged it without checking it to see if it was hot. So I went to the front and checked my food and it was barely luke warm. So I asked Danielle the host if she could feel it. She said There is a little heat. I asked if she would accept food like that and she said she would have to try it to know. So she took the food back and than she had several conversation with cost while looking my way. The manager come out and said is it ok to reheat the food because she don't want to waist it. I said are you going to microwave it and she said no I will put it in a pan and saute it again. She brought the food out and rushed me out because there was now a lobby full of people she didn't want them to hear.  So customer service sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Update: so the manager finally got there and he apologized which was appreciated and also gave us 20% off our bill. What I wasn't happy with was that he told us that 15 minutes after a reservation the host can seat other people, we were there at 5:55pm and our entire party was there at 6:08pm and our reservation was at 6pm, so we were well within \"policy times\". Also after we had paid there was a party of 2 people who had their own hibachi table and chef, so really what was the problem with seating our party of 6 at a table with enough space?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my husband's birthday dinner last week and Chef Eddie was very entertaining. Food was delicious. Will be returning soon with our kiddos who will get a kick out of the chef entertaining cooking."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface by saying I'd give the sushi 5 stars and the hibachi 2. 

We came here with two other couples for my husband's birthday on a Saturday evening, 5 o'clock. There wasn't a wait for a table, but we spent 25 minutes in between ordering and when the chef came to our table. 

I'm pretty sure the chef we had was newer to the game, he dropped untensils on the floor, threw an oil-covered egg at our pregnant friend and threw rice all over the place while cooking. My scallops were crazy over-cooked and rubbery, to the point where I didn't eat them, and the rice was meh. 

The strangest thing is that he put this 'special sauce' on everything. The 'special sauce' was in a bowl, it was a fuchsia pasty substance that looked like bubble-gum flavored butter. It smelled of garlic, but he wouldn't tell us what was in it. This stuff went on E V E R Y T H I N G. It turned the fried rice pink, as well as my scallops, the shrimp, lobster, filet Mignon, strip steak and chicken. He even doused the tofu with it. 

I'm not a fan of fuchsia-colored, overcooked scallops.

The sushi was phenomenal. I got the dragon roll which was a California roll topped with eel and avocado and dressed with eel sauce. Holy yum. I didn't want to stop eating it. So fresh, absolutely delicious. 

We'll be back for sushi, but will stick to Ohjah for hibachi. 

- oh! They also added an 18% gratuity."}
{"text":"I'd been to the Geisha House in Los Angeles and expected the same type of restaurant. However, that was not the case. Service was really slow. We sat at the hibachi grill and, although the woman took our food order extremely fast, we had to wait for an additional six people to fill up the remaining seats (about 30 minutes) before they began cooking any of the food. I guess this is normal in Vegas, as I've seen other restaurants do the same, but it was a bit bizarre to me. The food they grill on the hibachi (fried rice, veggies, and meat) is all cooked with (at least what the chef said) watermelon ice cream, rather than garlic butter. It was interesting, but not exactly appetizing in my opinion. The steak was good and the sushi was decent but I've had much better for less dough. Overall it just wasn't what I was expecting. I'm sure others may come here and find it enjoyable and delicious, but unfortunately I'll be looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried off the menu ordering with our party of 6 and everything was fantastic.  The steak and fish were different but great with wonderful presentations.  Great service and don't miss the honey toast for dessert.  It's incredible.  Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said \"We'll be back\"."}
{"text":"First time here an it was awesome. Came her for my best friends birthday an it was great. The food an the service were perfect. I had the land lovers combination an it was very good. Filet mignon an new York steak were cooked perfect an great flavor. The chicken as well. They give you so much food worth every penny.  I had the sushi as well an it was the bomb. The what the heck roll is a must try as well as the Philadelphia roll. Both were amazing. I also had the  chocolate cinnamon martini..omg yumm yumm..all in all it was a perfect meal. I would go there again to eat even just for rhe sushi."}
{"text":"This location is my most favorite restaurant on the north side of Vegas!  I've been going there for over 5 years now and we always make it a point to go there for just about every special occasion.  The entire staff is wonderful and Evon is the absolute best!  The Geisha Special is my favorite... the sushi is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar it was busy but our bar tender was amazing! He was very attentive to our group and we had a great time! He made beautiful and strong drinks the atmosphere we very warm and inviting. We had sushi and it was 50% so that was a plus!! Anyways I would come back!"}
{"text":"Worst visit ever.  We made reservations and sat there for over20 minutes waiting to be seated while people with no reservations were attended to. I had to ask the hostess if we were going to be seated twice. The meal was good but good luck getting service, the waitress never checked on our drinks, we had to make the cook leave the table to get service.  At the end of the meal the cook was cleaning the grill, wasn't paying attention, and got hot water in husbands eye.... the waitress offered us a bag of ice.  I hate writing bad reviews but tks one was needed.  Worst $250 meal of my life!"}
{"text":"The waiter Alex was amazing! Extremely professional and friendly! It was our first time going and we will be returning customers for sure! The food was fast and delicious! Fun atmosphere, and very clean."}
{"text":"Wow, I don't know about the other reviews but this place was awesome. 
There were two cooks on a Monday night and the soup and salad were good while we waited, which wasn't long. I don't remember our cooks name but he's from Columbia and he was great! He had personality and he had charm and a little pizazz to the presentation. Me and the bf each had cocktails and Yakitori. I ordered the Filet Mignon and he had the NY steak. The rice was great, the meat... each little piece was a pice of heaven. Originally the cook gave us two sauces but during our conversaion he gave us a third very very spicy sauce which to say at this moment as i'm Yelpin. well the spice danced on my tongue and laughed at me as i gulped down water. But i loved it. And now..i could some milk :)
The place is kinda of small and can see that if they were busy how it might taint the experience. So go on a monday~ 
Also the decor wasn't bad either with the dark wooden art pieces, dark framed mirrors and big red hanging ball lights.
Bottom line :  Small, good and unique."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great tepan than this is the place. Everything is delicious and the chef's are entertaining.  Great place for anniversary's.  Among my favorites were the filet mignon and the egg rolls. The service was exceptional and the owner is brilliant!!!! Way to go Geisha!!!"}
{"text":"I drive from north Las Vegas to go here all the time.  That should speak for itself."}
{"text":"So I totally thought this was THE Geisha House when I was looking up steakhouses on Yelp and it took my boyfriend and I like an hour to find this place because a)we're not from around Vegas, b)where the eff does desert inn road come from? c)it was night time and the sign to Geisha House is this tiny little thing and I was looking for the fancy Geisha House. So yeah, we were a little reluctant to go inside, considering the scenery was pretty ghetto and run-down but i'm SO GLAD we did because this was the best steak I have ever had in my little life.

Both of us ordered the NY steak strip-this piece of meat was so tender and such good quality, it might as well have been filet mignon. The chef did his thing and cooked everything in front of us, playing with knives and what not, adding magic red stuff here and a bottle labeled \"diet coke\" there, creating the most delicious meal I have ever had. I mean, seriously, this may be my number one meal to have before I die. I'm coming back to Vegas from Geisha House. YUM

With the NY Steak, you get three pieces of shrimp, the best fried rice ever (they add sesame seeds which are a nice touch), vegetables (mushrooms, onions, zucchini, and bean sprouts) and soup (some kind of mushroom miso soup, so good) and salad (your basic Japanese salad with ginger dressing, amazing!) All of this is for 20 dollars. 

Service was impeccable, atmosphere is cozy and intimate and not exactly   very elegant, but my bf and I don't roll that way anyway; we would rather have good quality food over ambiance. 

Over-all..A+. This makes me sad that we live in California and not near this Japanese steakhouse."}
{"text":"This is a great place for group dinners for many occasions. The wait staff is very attentive by making sure dirty dishes were taken away and our waters were filled. I also like their food. They use a tasty \"special sauce\" on almost all the teppanyaki food. The teppanyaki chefs are very entertaining for kids and adults alike. Expect to spend a lot of money, however. The Teppan-Yaki meals here will cost you between $21-39 per person. That adds up when you factor in drinks, tax, and tip."}
{"text":"Lured in by the snazzy exterior only to walk out with a disappointment. I'm extremely picky with Japanese cuisine partially because I am Japanese and grew up in Japan. I do not like fusion Japanese food and still trying to figure out why it even exist. What makes Japanese food so good is its simplicity, so why add unnecessary touches? 

Service was alright. We've had multiple servers serving us. Our main server was out of place in my opinion. Dim lighting with hip ratchet playlist added to a night club vibe yet somewhat intimate. This lady kept walking back and forth like she was on crack and talked to us with so much excitement. I don't mind seeing a server like that at Pancake House or Egg works, but definitely not a dine-in restaurant with intimate vibe. No thanks. 

After perusing through the menu, we went with 12pc sashimi set as well as fat boy. Got a kiwi martini (?) on the side to start off and that was refreshing and good. 

Despite the fact that we were the only one there, food took a good 20-25mins to arrive. 12pc sashimi was the first to arrive to the table. All sashimi had a thick and generous cut and tasted fresh. Of course while we are enjoying the sashimi, lady on crack walks back and forth to tell us \"Hi, so your fat boy is coming soon. Like 5 mins.\" Then comes back few minutes later, \"It will take like 3 mins.\" ...leave us alone holy cow.

Finally, fat boy comes to the table. 8 tiny pieces of greasy mess. Initially I wanted to try more fusion roll but looking at the menu, all rolls comes with either cream cheese (which I don't like in sushi) or spicy sauce (I can't handle spice). Fat boy was the only acceptable choice for me even though it had cream cheese in it. My reaction was just \"meh\".....I was once again reminded on why I don't like fusion rolls. 

Considering they are a steakhouse, I should have tried their teppanyaki instead of sushi to fully enjoy what they had to offer. However, they are also called the sushi bar and they are less than mediocre in that department. Overall service and food gets this place a solid 2 stars."}
{"text":"Went in for some table cooking.  Once we got seated started talking and noticed a cock roach cruising around. Next we got our salads and the lettuce was browned.  After quite a bit of time chef comes out and makes a decent dinner but has absolutely no showmanship.  Never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"If you have never experienced hibachi, you should give it a whirl.  If you have, then you can probably write this review yourself.  Hibachi is definitely a fun way to have an OK dinner with a bunch of people.

Geisha is no different than any other.  I had the New York Steak for $21.  The meal comes with soup, salad, shrimp, fried rice, and veggies.  Everything was A-OK, except the salad.  The salad was yucky white translucent iceberg...that stuff doesn't even count as lettuce.  Seriously? Other than that, everything was tasty as expected.  My steak was a lovely med rare and the veggies nice and crisp.  

The performance from our chef was exactly as I've seen it before.  It think there is some sort of standardized testing for these guys...It seems like they all follow the exact same script.  That said, he was very nice and friendly and did a good job cooking our grub."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing ! I've been going here for years. And Eddie always keeps us entertained and makes our dinners more relaxed and interactive. Plus the food and the special sauce is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Such an amazing Japanese steak house! We came for a friends birthday, the man cooking our food in front of us was so fun! He really made my experience. People come to these kinds of places for the experience of their chef and the experience of the habachi grill cooking and that really sealed the deal for me. He also didn't over cook any of my food, and made it taste delicious. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Omg I loooove the hibachi style meals that these kind of restaurants offer. Geisha house steak & sushi know how to cook their food so well, it always tastes really good. They use some special sauce to flavor their fried rice (so good!) this time, I wanted to go and enjoy the meal, and not have to sit around the chef and just sit at my own table, and they were willing to accommodate that! Food came out fast, service was nice, can't wait to come bacj"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but honestly... These folks need to get their act together. Came in here once and they said happy hour was only in restaurant, then hostess argued with the bartender and said happy hour was at the bar. My party of 7 got frustrated and left. I gave it another chance. Manager said happy hour okay at sushi bar. Server charged us full price. I complained and then he said nobody told him. Is that my fault? This establishment needs to have a better pre shift before they open. They should just have happy hour throughout the restaurant. I spent a hundred bucks and left still pretty hungry. The drinks were pretty good, though."}
{"text":"What a beautiful eating experience.

I honestly don't know where to start.

So we made reservations for Valentines Day around 7:30PM.

They first seated us at a big group cooking table like a Benihanas but they switched us to a nice table when we told them we wanted to go with sushi.

I will be honest our waitress was really cold. Not friendly or welcoming.

Luckily the food and drinks made up for the lack of friendly service!

We ordered 6 rolls between the three of us and none of us were disappointed.

But you have to order their passion fruit fish bowl cocktail.

It was hands down one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had!"}
{"text":"It's true that Geisha House is not in a good area of town and that its strip mall setting leaves much to be desired as far as hip atmosphere goes....but really, I think that makes me like it all the more. It seems like you've really found something when you come in here to eat. The decor inside is totally cheesy with Chinese lanterns and fake bamboo everywhere, but at least it doesn't look like a PT's like everything else in this town! 
The teppanyaki is very good. There is lots of butter in every dish and also lots of \"secret sauce,\" which, from what I can gather, is a flavored butter, so if you are watching your calories, this is not the place for you! 
Prices are reasonable - lower than Benihana for the exact same meal & show.
Service is excellent - I have always had a very good experience with the friendly hosts/bartenders/chefs.
Overall, Geisha House is not exactly a special-occasion restaurant, but it is a good fun place to go for a night out."}
{"text":"Geisha House is the perfect family dinner outing! The management makes sure you are taken care of the entire evening, and most importantly they show repeat customers loyalty by providing a complimentary drink, small sushi, or dessert occasionally. Another great aspect of the Geisha House is how your chef makes the customers night entertaining with jokes, and food play. Every child I've seen at the restaurant is laughing, smiling, and their eyes are fixated on the cooking! Overall, this is best Japanese Hibachi restaurant in Las Vegas. Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed! Also, the speciality drinks at the bar are over the top!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite place for sushi but definitely the closest one for hibachi. Honestly, the customer service is a little overwhelming. I think they need to take it easy a little bit and don't try so hard. At first I thought I'm in a car dealership and they are trying to sell me various items on the menu. 
Hibachi was very good though. I had steak and shrimp and really enjoyed watching the cook preparing it. Steak was very tender and perfectly cooked. Would probably go back there again for hibachi."}
{"text":"Valentines Dinner 2013!!!

Question for you...Where does a Yelper celebrate Valentines?  A restaurant that's been bookmarked, that's where.  No quiet candle light, no short walk around town, and no 5 star restaurant.  I'm just as romantic as it gets.  

Geisha Steakhouse is located on the eastside of town.  Not the best neighborhood at night, but nothing stands in my way when it comes to food.  Their normal menu is put on hold for Valentines so the choices are Their Valentines Dinner ($99), Seafood Lover ($40 each person), or their Land Lover ($40 each person).  I wanted to try their Land Lover, which consisted of their Rib Eye, Chicken and Filet Mignon.  I wanted this so bad, but couldn't since I dropped red meat for Lent.  My Valentine and I opted for the Seafood Lover which consists of Shrimp, Scallops, Lobster, and fried rice.  I admit, this meal was pretty damn good.  All three seafood pieces looked, tasted great, and was flavorful.  I've always loved lobster and shrimp, now scallops are becoming a new favorite. Because it was seafood, the meal wasn't too filling in the beginning. In other words, I wasn't initially full. It wasn't until I finished my fried rice that I became stuffed.  I was so full that my second Valentine venture was going to be a tough one to accomplish. 

I enjoyed the ambiance that almost all Teppanyaki restaurants have to offer.  Geisha Steakhouse has that same type of ambiance;  group type seating, entertaining/skillfull teppanyaki chefs, and great tasting food. 

I really can't wait until Easter so I can come back and try their chicken and filet mignon.  You definitely can't go wrong with this place since there's a selection.  

PS:  I love me some lobster.  Geisha's was good, but they also reminded me that I must take a trip back to Lobster Me for their Lobster Mac N' Cheese."}
{"text":"Watch your back Benihana.  

Geisha House is sexy, off-the strip and not sporting tourist bilking prices.  I came upon this new(ish) location when looking for teppanyaki on a Saturday night.  It's in the old Sapporos spot.  I really loved Sapporos and was afraid to even go here for fear that it would start the grieving process all over, but Geisha House was good enough to make me forget about Sapporo.  Although this place still looks a lot like Sapporos, there are 12 teppanyaki tables, 2 of which are in VIP and 2 of which are outside.  

There were 5 of us and everyone really enjoyed their food.  I split the Sealover Special - scallops, lobster and shrimp complete with salad, soup, entrée and a free drink - wine, soft drink or sake.  For $39.95, it's a steal of a deal.  I also had the 90% sushi roll and was very impressed.  Service was a little iffy, but the chef and a helpful server (Harrison, I think) tried to smooth out the rough patches.  The chef was probably one of the more entertaining chefs I've ever had.  Much better than my experience at the teppanyaki table at Ohjah.

They do happy hour every day in the bar/patio area until 9 p.m. and I can imagine the patio would be awesome on a hot Vegas night.  Fun spot."}
{"text":"I cannot complain about the food; however, I will say the service was lacking. Never before have I been somewhere where sushi comes out before the kid's meal. My husband and I were practically done before our kids' soup, salad and meal came to the table. We had to ask several times about their food. It was as if the order was never placed or was not important. For the price of this restaurant, I was not impressed. I'm not saying I won't give it another try, but my hopes will not be high on the return."}
{"text":"One of the worse experiences ever! I have never had a waiter so rude and continuously rush me, leaving me to feel so uncomfortable! I felt pressured and irritated when I had planned of a night with friends to eat and socialize. Also there was a bug underneath our table! His explanation was they had the restaurant sprayed with peptides, so they're just coming out. Very comforting!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm coming to this geisha house for 11years 5 stars for everythings.  i recommend to eat shrimp dinner or scallop dinner at here, i think grill have something specials here."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!! Whether you choose to do sushi or the grill, this place is excellent! The staff is awesome too! Sad to say, but they know me by name and greet me each time I visit! :) The rolls are well made and each chef does an equally good job of preparing what you order.  The managers are always present and go out of their way to ensure you are enjoying your dining experience. 
Negatives: they can be somewhat pricey. They used to have a happy hour that offered by two get one free rolls (great for pairs), but it seems to phase in and out of availability.  They also have late night naked sushi/party (I think they alternate weeks with the Fort Apache location), but when we tried to go it was kinda dead in there...but I've heard that it is usually a hot spot! *shrug* 

Overall, I have repeatedly found the food to be well-prepared, fresh/good quality and the staff is friendly enough to make me feel comfortable and welcome. I vote try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Went to Geisha House tonight and had a great experience.  Our waiter, Barry, was super professional and very personable.  We ordered both sushi. (love the lasagna rolls) and the scallop special, chef made a special dessert for us!  Those  banana wontons were so delicious.  My only critique would have been to space the dishes a bit more since we were sharing everything.  We will return!"}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for some delicious affordable tepenyaki while in Vegas. I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.

It is located away from the strip in an obscure strip mall and was pretty empty when we arrived. We were seated right away at over sized booths surrounding the grill.  My 2 daughters and I all ordered the New York steak dinner and my husband ordered the shrimp dinner.

Our soup was brought out quickly followed by our salads.  Shortly after our chef arrived and was very interactive and entertaining. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great look, great vibe, great time. That pretty much sums up my night at the new Geisha House on W Flamingo.  I was very impressed with the look of this new location. This new Geisha House is really set up well. Whether you are there for hibachi, casual dining, sushi, or a drink, you really can't go wrong. 

The first thing I noticed when walking in was the giant LED screen behind the sushi bar. It really sets the tone for the restaurant and lets the guests know that the décor is a high priority at this location. The restaurant is also quite spacious when compared to the other Geisha Houses which adds to a more elegant atmosphere. Additionally, it's a perfect place to watch monday night football!!

Their selection of draft beer is exceptional!
My night was spent at the bar while I tried different appetizers, sushi, and drinks. The food and drinks combined for a great combination while socializing with friends. They offer several special cocktails on the menu including the Ginger Sake Mojito, which I found to be really good.  The service was great as the staff was very friendly and helpful and had a good familiarity with the menu despite the restaurant being open for such a short time. Management also seemed to take an interest in our dining experience as they stopped by to see how we were doing and if everything was ok.

Overall I was very impressed with this Geisha House and definitely plan on returning soon for some hibachi. This first visit was really made to check out the new location and see how it felt. I must say it made a good impression on me as I plan on returning soon for another fun night. :)"}
{"text":"Staff was very polite. Our chef was great! 
Took my mom out for her birthday dinner along with two others and a 6 year old. 
My 6 year old loved the entertainment with the chef. Great atmosphere and very clean. I would recommend this place for people who enjoy entertainment and food."}
{"text":"Naked sushi event,so bad hibachi and sushi, I don't like"}
{"text":"Fun at the hibachi table, but personal tables available. It's been perfect every time I go. Big fan of the land lovers special."}
{"text":"Seeing that they were now open for lunch, I came with a friend today. Usually the dinner is always amazing and a great place for a special occasion, so I figured lunch would be the same. As expected it was great! We ordered the garlic edamame and yakitori to start, and our entrees consisted of the bento (beef teriyaki) and the chicken katsu. For desert we split a green tea creme Brule. The visuals were amazing, and the taste was even better. There was so much food that neither of us were even able to finish either entrees. I'd deem the price worthy of the portion and the taste really worth the money. Overall our experience was great; food, interior/atmosphere. I'll post pictures of the entrees along with the review so that you can see what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Good hibachi dinner. Geisha special is the best value. It gets packed on the weekends and a little loud. Sake bombs all the time. Make reservations for the weekend. Chefs are personable and the wait staff are on top of it."}
{"text":"We love the sushi here, it's always fresh. On special occasions we do hibachi hi which is also delish. W have been going there for years it's consistently good and staff is always great."}
{"text":"So. Delicious. We are from out of town and were staying up the road. Decided to give it a try and were we sooooo NOT disappointed. This was some of the best sushi I have ever had. Thanks Ryan (manager maybe owner) your service was top notch."}
{"text":"Felix is the man on the hibachi grill. And devin was awesome as well. Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is terrible.  

1st experience was opening night which is excusable although it took the server 30 mins to even ask if we wanted something to drink. 

So hey we thought we would give it another shot almost a year later. Nothing has changed. 

our server abandoned us mid way through our meal near the bar (seated on the patio) without any warning. He went back behind the bar and proceeded to help the customers while leaving us . 

We had to constantly flag down other staff and eventually had to walk up to the bar multiple times to get the attention of other staff. 

They brought us another tables food then proceeded to take 25 mins per check back on the table. We were there nearly 2 hours and finally frustrated left still  hungry. 

Bottom line : terrible service which is inexcusable in las vegas

When I paid for my meal I went up to the bar to get my check because I waited 25 mins for a check the original server actually came up to me and asked if I needed help. I responded that we could have used your help earlier since you were our original server. He didnt respond but (probably caught off guard) instead turned his back on me and walked away, I found this extremely rude."}
{"text":"This location of Geisha House was recommended by friends so we came on a Saturday night. First thing we noticed when we walked in was how beautiful it is. Second thing we noticed was it was very warm in the entire restaurant. Since it was 104 outside, I guess the A/C was working overtime. Was a bit uncomfortable. For appetizers, I had the Blue Fin Tuna, which was fantastic and wifey had the veggie tempura, very well done and crispy. Our friend decided she wanted a martini for an appetizer, she said it was spot on. For mains, I had their 12 piece sushi dinner, everything was fresh, well made and delicious. Wifey stuck with the tempura, the Pork Belly skewers and crispy Won Ton  appetizers. Our friend had the Lamb Lollipops, these were great as well. Overall with the exception of the restaurant being way too warm, was a great evening."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister to test out the place because she found a good deal through groupon. right off the bat, the woman that was serving us had a stranger sense of humor and it kept throwing me off. she seemed very sarcastic. she was gossiping to us about other customers. she seemed very nonprofessional and it made me uncomfortable. she also kept pushing the specials for the night on us in a very pushy way. she also came back at least 3 times to ask if i was ready before i could even thoroughly look through the menu. i kid you not....i was only sitting there for about 5 mins and she asked me 3 times if i was ready. i arrived 1 hour before closing and i can see that she obviously didnt want to have to stay later then she had to that night. she suggested i ordered the pork belly skewers, and i said yes...they arrived chewy and i ended up having to rip the tough fat off the meat. it was hard cold and chewy. i expect my pork belly to be cooked with a nice crisp. the fat should be cooked to a crispness where its edible. i also ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the baked mussels off their tapas menu. both dishes tasted very similar. it was odd. they had a very sweet taste to both of them. i didnt like this at all. i was expecting something savory.  i ordered a dragon roll and Yellow tail Lover roll....both seemed pretty standard...nothing special.  the only thing that was good was the sushi roll called \"something wrong\". it was really good....and its the only reason why i am giving a 2 star rating versus 1 star. all in all.....i wont be coming back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"I must say that I've only been here twice, but both visits have been rather memorable. One for my mother's birthday and another on my brother's birthday. I suppose that knowing management has its perks in some pleasurable way.

On both counts we ordered the Geisha combination. Both had polite chefs, the first one more chattery than the last. The volcano tower fire rising from the onions trick gets me every time and would always amuse my family as well. 

We ordered an array of sashimi and sushi rolls, mostly on the spicy side since my dad likes spicy rolls even when my mom would interject a few times that she can't handle it. I wish they had more choices for nigiri like salmon belly or cajun albacore or yuzu-infused scallop.

In the end, my brother was satisfied with most if the teppanyaki meats served to him as well as the fried rice. My mother was overjoyed with the flavorful desserts and being entertained by the chefs. Since they always had a thing for being packrats and never waste food we were able to get a few stacks of takeout boxes for a lot of the leftovers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my wife and left disappointed. There were only ten customers, I ordered the grilled salmon bento box and my wife a salad and a sushi roll. The bento box arrived quickly with very overcooked salmon, a limp looking salad that looked like it came from a premixed salad bag from Smiths. The sushi roll in my box was mediocre. My wife waited 45 minutes for her salad with the waitress stating the chef was busy. Her sushi roll was good and arrived with the salad. Needless to say we are less than impressed and have no plans to return."}
{"text":"Happy hour review. Stopped in on Fri for happy hour. Place was pretty empty. I knew after 5 mins I should have gotten up and left but nope. Big mistake. Prob the worst happy hour I've been to. 

-coconut shrimp:  so pathetic. Was laughable. The shrimp is literally the coconut shrimp from the grocery store . Gordons coconut shrimp. It's so small and covered in breading. I took a pic of it.

Ginger mojito: served in a small glass and overflowing with ice. Literally ice cubes kept falling out of the glass. Just for laughs I finished drink in one swig. It's essentially a big shot not a drink. And the happy hour price is $8. Lol"}
{"text":"Happy hour only. 

There were plenty of choices and for the price it was well worth it. I ended up with the lychee martini and it was almost like old times when it was Sapporos! It was dead for a Friday for happy hour but the restaurant side was packed!

Service was a bit slow but I figured that it was just because the restaurant side was busy which was keeping the bartenders busy. Overall the food was decent and I left full and not feeling broke. I like that the happy hour is longer that 2 hours. I think it's from 4-9? Everyday. It is well worth the luc here martini, the couple of rolls that I shared and the mussels. I definitely would come back if I had to pick a place for happy hour again."}
{"text":"ehhhhh.. if you want the whole teppanyaki grill experience this place could be worthy but i know ive had better. 

went here with a big group of friends and the food was okay, cool atmosphere, the portions are kind of small for the price, and i had to complain about my order cuz the guy who was cooking in the teppanyaki mixed it up, he was charging us more of what we ordered compared with our other friends who ordered the same thing and he didnt even apologize... customer is always righttt! hello???

go somewhere else:]"}
{"text":"I love, love the food. It's basically the same as Beni Hani, but cheaper."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was great!!! We did teppanyaki and had an amazing time. I had the chicken and it was cooked and flavored perfectly. I also had the lychee martini which was amazing!! 

The service was incredible. Our chef was amazing but I can't remember his name. :( Nina was amazing as well! She was always checking on us to see if we needed anything. Thank you for the excellent service. 

We will definitely be back soon! Thank you Geisha House!"}
{"text":"Went to naked fish happy hour. Really bad bad service and they charge mandatory $5 gratuity. Not worth the food. Never will go back. And bad service and had to pay the tips."}
{"text":"This is an updated review for Geisha House. I previously gave this restaurant 4 stars but am now changing it to 5. Me and my family came to have dinner here tonite. The kids loved it. Its the first time i bring them here and they were amazed. The food was good like always. This time we tried their Vanilla ice cream dessert. Great way to finish our meal! The place was busy but we were still seated in an appropriate time and the customer service was very good. I will tell all my friends to come here if they are in the mood for a nice little show."}
{"text":"Came here early in the day before my lady had to work. So happy we came across this place. Great Atmosphere, great sushi, great drinks, and great service. Tai the sushi chef was phenomenal and Francis our waiter was great as well. All in all this is a gem and highly recommended. We will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere at this new Geisha House location. JC, the manager, was accommodating. Our servers Dylan and Nina were attentive even though it was busy. The food was delicious; and we've been to many sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. If you want a fun place with great music to hang out with a group of friends - this is the place!!! Sit in a booth near the back. That is where all the cool people are ;) Enjoy! We will be back."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant when it first opened and loved it! We ordered sushi, teppanyaki style shrimp and steak and had the dream bobba for dessert. The food was top notch and the service was better. The manager even sent us a round of drinks on the house just to thank us for dining."}
{"text":"December 26th 2017 was our first time to visit Geisha House.  I do not think we will be back.  Our reservations were for 6:30.  We were told to be there several minutes early so we can get seated.  We got there at 6:15.  (we had a party of 8) We did not get our table until 6:45 (not that bad, but why tell us to get there early just to wait a little longer)  Our drink order was taken and then our food order, this is where is went down hill.  There seem to be only 2 maybe 3 chefs. Our soup was missing ingredients, we did not get our appetizers until our food was being cooked which was about 7:30. A food order was skipped for one person in our party and his food wasn't cooked until everyone else had started getting their food. My water was only refilled once.  Our chef wasn't enthusiastic.  The whole experience was bad.  My family does not do nights like this very often and to spend $200 on my family of 4 and to have this experience was a huge let down. Our waitress did give us our 2 orders of eggrolls for free, but the evening was just a bust."}
{"text":"We came here hoping to find to diamond in the rough but sadly we were disappointed. The restaurant is in need of cleaning which makes me wonder what the back looks like. The food is okay - I liked the fillet. The special sauce was just plain weird - sorry I don't get it. The bill was $100 for 2 of us, and frankly I think I can do better and eat in a clean place too. Maybe the other locations are better than this but I couldn't possibly recommend this.

Stars are for service and entertainment value. Otherwise the experience is meh."}
{"text":"This place is always nice to go after a day of running errands. The sushi is delish and they have a wide variety to choose from. The steak and fried rice is very fresh and amazing. Friendly staff and clean restaurant. I have never had a problem eating here. I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"The food is good. Honestly, my husband and I came here for lunch a week after going to a $300 hibachi/Japanese restaurant in a 5-Star hotel & at a fraction of price, Geisha tasted so much better. We ate hibachi and had chicken, steak, shrimp and lobster. All were tastey & Their fried rice is good (had to get over the color first).  Great place for kids and the experience. But they really really need a deep clean before I come back. I'm so close to being a germaphobe and I couldn't get over the dust so I had an uneasy feeling the entire time."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite of ours for special events and celebrations. My children aren't little anymore, so the tossing of knives and sparks of fire aren't as thrilling as they once were, but I think the nostalgia of all of it evokes many happy memories.  

This visit was to celebrate my father's 71st birthday and Father's Day.  We were not disappointed.  The food is always fabulous and plentiful.  We never fail to have leftovers to take home.  My filet was cooked perfectly, and I'm very picky about my meat.  It was like butter melting in my mouth. Our cook, Ryan, was outstanding trying to get smiles and laughs out of my teenagers.  

My father is in a wheelchair and they were very accommodating to his needs.  Handicap parking was easily available and convenient to the restaurant.  Regular parking was very abundant, as they are in the same center as a Walmart."}
{"text":"It is a little harder to write bad reviews for an establishment that I knows is better than the service my group got.

My group of five walk in and was asked if we had reservation.  Of course five guys wouldn't have decided to make reservations.  But the hostess was accommodating and seating us in a front corner of the restaurant tightly squeezed between the sushi bar and the glass window wall. 
None of us thought about it really until we started getting service and the server had to reach/practically lay across the table to hand out drinks or plates. It annoyed the hell out me being that I was the one at the end of the table.

Next was issue was that my order of sushi had been forgotten about. And when our server came to check on us everyone else was done. She first ask if anyone wanted anything else.  That's when I mentioned that I didn't receive my order.  I had to wait another 10 minutes after that. 

I'm not sure if we caught them at a bad time but I do not recommend going here on the whim when they might be busy or without reservation. The food was good but service was crappy."}
{"text":"1. Overpriced. 
2. Sushi rolls are complicated with various ingredients that do not necessarily go well together. 

We were not very impressed with the food. The yellowtail jalapeño carpaccio lacked flavor.  

We arrived during happy hour with specials including half off sake bottles and 30% off rolls. 

Probably will satisfy our occasional sushi cravings elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual. The show was entertaining as it should be. The had a blast and I got drunk off of a martini and 2 shots of patron cause they hooked each shot up in huge cups. Probably equaled 4 or more shots easily. Needless to say, I was too drunk to eat my yummy food. Came back to our hotel and passed out while hubby and the kids played in the hot tub of our suite. Woke up the next morning, excited to chow down on my leftovers... but the knuckle heads eat it all. 

Till we meet again Geisha House... Yum!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Geisha House, and we've lived here for 40 Year's. Our server was nice and attentive, but it was hard for me to distinguish his sarcasm as humor, or just being over it lol The food was a little above average. I did have some of there fresh, basic sushi, and it was good which added to it not being overpriced. The main dinner entrees are large enough to split, which I would recommend considering they are a tad bit pricey. Overall...I know now to get one entree between 2 people, and get it with some sushi.. you'd be set. I will say the energy of staff is lacking... one chef, which seemed to handle the order of guest's that were coming in just fine, and our hard to read server could probably use some help with another server or 2. Apparently they added the sushi bar side recently, and glammed up that side of the restaurant. Being a local I always hope for original restaurant's to stick around and keep their character...many people have memories here, and its located in an area best catered to locals. I will come back another time, and give it another try. I LOVE sushi, and these guy's have some competition with all the great sushi places in town. I would love to see the owner turn up the staff energy a notch."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab dinner before shopping at Target and decided to give Geisha House a try. The hostess greeted us and we explained that we had never been there before. She said \"It's like Benihana\". (I wanted to laugh but refrained.) We said that we would give the Hibachi a try. She explained that it would be 15-20 minutes because there were only 2 chefs working and they both had just started their tables. She said that the bar was having a Happy Hour and they had sushi specials so we decided to give it a try. 

The atmosphere in the bar was cozy, airy and elegant. We opted for a couch and were promptly greeted with a stack of menus. We started with the Pork Gyoza ($5) which were delicious and paired beautifully with our drinks - Saki Ginger Mojito and Japanese Mule. The only negative for me was the sauce...it was a little too heavy and sweet for me. I would have preferred a light Ponzu. 

We then ordered 2 different Specialty Sushi Rolls (30% off during Happy Hour) with Spicy Shrimp, Scallops and Soft Shelled Crab - both delicious!  My only complaint is that we asked for brown rice and were told, \"I think we ran out last night and I don't know if they made any more today\". 

Our server (Crystal) and the bartender were nice and attentive. We took advantage of the Yelp Check-in special - Free Mochi Dessert. We opted for Strawberry (they also had Mango and Green Tea) and loved it! 

We would definitely go back for Happy Hour and we would also love to try the Hibachi."}
{"text":"I ate here the other day and the food was very impressive!! The rolls are incredible and unique.

I went on Friday at 11:45 PM and there was 30% off happy hour on all sushi rolls

The price is right and it's a beautiful high-scale resturant!!! The theme is amazing"}
{"text":"Eddie is the bestest and the food was good the show on the grill was awesome too! Sake sake bomb bomb!"}
{"text":"This place deserves five stars all because of Chris the sushi chef. Call ahead and make sure he's there before going. Ask him for his special \"Exclamation Point\" dish. It will rock your socks off. It will be on your list of top sushi experiences of all time.

Screaming orgasm (12 PC. Sashimi) was delicious as was yellowtail belly sashimi. All made by him.

What a joyous culinary experience!!"}
{"text":"Get the screaming orgasm! You will not regret it! I have ordered numerous items off of the menu and have never been disappointed. This place is hands down one of the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. 

Jorge is our favorite chef and always puts on a good show while being friendly. Perfect date night location. 

The food is always excellent and the sushi is to die for. 

Great place to go if you have out of town visitors as they cater to picky eaters."}
{"text":"Geisha is the place to be! John was an excellent cook and gave a great show the food is amazing as well! And I also recommend the drink lights at Havana. love this place"}
{"text":"Delicious. Lively & cozy atmosphere. Service prompt and good food. Ordered the Filet Mignon dinner and was very satisfied. Started off with usual hibachi style show of clanging utensils and flipping. Watch out for chefs who like to over do the onion volcano trick because you might lose your eyebrows! Began with onion soup, then salad with light ginger dressing. The fried rice was tasty and couldn't go wrong with the Geisha \"secret butter sauce\", that everything was doused in. The veggies were standard, nice large flavorful shrimp appetizer and finally on to the main attraction...lean, tender, buttery filet mignon.
Definitely worth the price for a lot of good food. Can't wait for the next time."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The mood was set perfectly for the event. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. My waiter was very polite and professional. The food was also really good. Didn't take long to to receive our dinner and enjoy our night."}
{"text":"The Geisha house on Decatur are always hiring new cooks.  Last night the food was awful. They AGAIN hired a new cook and he was so nervous he made the rice with no seasoning no sauce.  Bland as hell.  Forget the show the eggs were burnt (before he even put them in the rice)   The head of all the Giesha house's happened to be there and refunded my money but because my husband was heavy he said he had to pay for the bad food.  We USE to go here every weekend BUT its gone way down hill. DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"I get the feeling that everyone who works here are just a group of friends who know what the hell they are doing because everything is perfect and they got their shit down pat.

The staff makes sure you leave happy, full and having a great lasting impression of the place.  Since we walked in w.o an appointment we had to wait 5-10 minutes to get seated (not a big deal at all).  The cooks were highly entertaining and they make damn good food.  Honestly I tried the stake special and the geisha special, and you can't go wrong with either.

My only regret was not ordering the Geisha special the first time. Filet, lobster, chicken and shrimp, all of it was spectacular.  I'm not even that  much of a sea food guy (yes I love sushi but anything cooked it's tough for me to like).  The serving size was plentiful and overall it's just a great experience to go to.

I love the ambiance and overall feel of the place, the staff can make your night a night to remember.  Super fun, great food, and it's all a really great value.

PS: Awsome rice.

Great job guys, 5 Stars

{"text":"They were rude when we walked in. And judged us because we weren't \"dressed up\". And FYI, happy hour is only at the bar"}
{"text":"Disappointed in new lunch menu for hibachi.  Have been coming regularly for a few years. Old hibachi lunch menu only available at a table. Raised prices for new table hibachi cooked meals and have nasty vegetables."}
{"text":"This place is a little hole in the wall!!! But it rocks!! Service just caught me off guard with their world class customer service!! So good it can get annoying!! First time sake bombed!! Over all amazing experience!!"}
{"text":"The weather was finally nice enough to eat outside on the patio.  The music was so loud that I had to ask our server to turn the music down.   We had another $40 Groupon for the 3 of us.

We ordered 3 rolls of sushi and a salad.

Vampire Roll ($11.95): Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Crab, Seared Albacore, Jalapenos with Garlic Ponzu sauce on the side.  I liked this roll and would order it again.

Spider Roll ($10.95):  This is my favorite roll and we have ordered it every time.

Salmon Skin Roll ($6.45):  I liked this roll so much that we ordered it again.  This time it was drowning in eel sauce.  Next time I would ask for the sauce on the side.

Ahi Poke Salad:  This was my favorite salad and we have ordered it a couple of times.

We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time I'm here, I'm always fascinated by the way the chefs prepare our meals.  We had a business meeting, so a place like this would be a great place to go to, just in case the meeting goes sour,  then you can always talk about the chef.  They will not seat you unless everyone in your party is physically inside the restaurant.  Once we were seated, our drink orders were immediately taken and delivered by Junia.  We waited about 10 minutes before she came around again to take our orders.  Soup came first and then the salad. The service was fast and smooth, so we thought.  We sat at the table for 25 minutes waiting for the chef to prepare our order, but no chef, no order.  Our drinks were refilled a couple times. But still, no chef.  Then,  the hostess sat a couple close to us (same hibachi table).  We had to wait another 15 minutes for the couple to finish their soup, salad and appetizer.  It was on a Thursday night around 6:30 pm when we were seated.  They were not busy at all.   The chef, Ryan, was really good, he did not engage much, unlike the previous chefs I've had , but he was still very good.  Overall, this place is okay.  I'll probably come again, but it won't be my first choice. Just saying"}
{"text":"Service was okay, took our order well, but didn't give refills much. Food was very peppery, but cooked decently. Soup was okay, salad was nice. Sushi was good. Overall price was okay, neither too expensive or cheap."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. My boyfriend and I started with getting seated and looking at the sake menu when a female server came by and told us we can't sit here if we want to have happy hour , which we weren't even aware of, or trying to order. We told the server we just wanted a bottle of sake , and instead of helping us she then walked away. Then a different server came over, got us our sake and we asked him the market price of the sweet shrimp and tuna belly , which he basically looked at us like we had two heads and we had to show him where these things were on the menu, then he left and came back with the prices . We proceed to order , which included a miso soup, which never came. And when we told our server at the end of the meal we never received our soup he then brought us 2 , which tasted like water , when we told our server the soup was off , he then informed us that the miso soup comes from a machine so he will make sure to take a look at it . GROSS. So we filled out one of the comment cards left on the table with our experience , and never heard anything back . I assume our server just threw it away . Will never return ."}
{"text":"Let start by saying, his name should be AWESOME CHEF JEFF!!! Out 4 Sam 40th Birthday with my Cousins could not have been any better. Awesome Chef Jeff gave us a GREAT SHOW & FOOD. If your ever in Las Vegas, MAKE SURE you hit this location, you won't be disappointed. GREAT CHEF (& he's eye candy ladies...Lol) GREAT STAFF,  GREAT FOOD, GREAT DRINKS & WONDERFUL ENTERTAINMENT!!!"}
{"text":"I thought this place had closed their west side location but I was glad to find out they just relocated. My husband and I ordered the Geisha special which comes with Fillet Mignon, Chicken, Shrimp Lobster, appetizer, soup, salad ,fried rice and a drink for $35.95. My husband doesn't eat seafood so I let him have some of my steak and chicken in exchange for his seafood. When the chef first started to warm up by juggling the spatula and big barbecue fork I was scared. He kept missing ...I was thinking that fork was going to end up in my eye! He got better though...he threw an egg in the air and sliced it in half with the spatula ...I was impressed. The chef was very entertaining he took this bottle and it looked like it squirted at me but it was just a prank. He was also joking with my husband who accidentally thanked him in Spanish..I didn't think he caught it until he was packing up his stuff and as he left he said, \"Gracias\". Eric who was our server was also very nice and personable he says he makes the best Sake Bombs around . We didn't have a Sake bomb but we did have Sour Apple Sake which was very flavorful. The meal was good I LOVE their fried rice here. It's one of the best I've tried in a restaurant. They put this pink stuff that looks like watermelon sorbet in everything they cook. I don't know what it is but it makes everything yummy. These are large portions so between me and my husband we had a full take home box to enjoy during the week."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my family of 11. & The first thing I would like to make clear is that their service was awful. I gave them the benefit of the doubt when we first got there and they wouldn't seat our group, even though we made a reservation, because they assumed that we were going to be using the chef, but we did not. We only wanted to order food from the menu. 

After we were seated, at a table for a chef, even though we were not using a chef, they said it was \"convenient for them\" if we sat at this table because our group was so \"large\". It's nice to know that they don't really care about our convenience, rather their own convenience was more important. 

When we did order, one guy came around to take our order and about half way through of taking our order a girl interrupted him in the middle of it and took over. Which i believe, lead to all the confusion that is to follow. 

I've worked in a restaurant for many years and 9 times out of 10 i will give every server the benefit of the doubt but there was truly nothing that could have excused what happened. They had a total of 4 tables aside from us with a total of at least 3 waiters/waitresses that i could see actually working. My family and i were extremely patient, very well knowing that we are a large group and sometimes its not always the easiest to serve large groups. 

Then they served us miso soup that was a little colder than room temperature, but we didn't want to complain so no one ate it. 

The waiter and the waitress began to bring out our food, but 5 people got their food and the other six of us had to wait. It wasn't until the 5 people that received their food were just about to finish that 3 other people got their food. 15 minutes later did they realize that they didn't bring out my grandmothers food, the waitress came to the table with the worst excuse that \"they made a mistake but they are cooking it now.\" 

So we waited, at least another 15 minutes, and majority of the group was done eating. My grandmother received her food and asked for a box because she no longer wanted to eat her food so that her whole family could wait for to complete her food. The waitress and/or waiter did not even apologize for their awful way of bringing the food out and served us the check with absolutely nothing to say and tacked on the 18% gratuity as if they deserved it due to their \"hard work\". 

I cant even say that the food was that great, i would rate that a so-so experience in regards to the food. 

I can definitely say they lost us as customers, and it was definitely not just one customer but 11 customers to be exact. Customer service is the top priority at restaurants, and i know this for having worked in a restaurant for 8 years."}
{"text":"Service is great and food is great and authentic. The whole experience was great and fun. Birthday celebration was made special. Will definitely come back here. The place, albeit small, makes the whole experience more homey. Had really great time with friends and family"}
{"text":"I am coming for my birthday dinner at 5pm and look forward to it!!! I love supporting restuarants in the area"}
{"text":"I had the sushi bar here on Saturday June 28, 2014. I love it very fresh and tasty. It was 8:30 so no one else at the Sushi Bar. Lots of others having hibachi which I did not want to do. They also an FMA event starting at 10:00 PM to 3:00AM it is a great party with a DJ who keeps the dance floor PACKED. If you are looking for a good time it a place to go. I am going to review that separately."}
{"text":"So in love with this place.. Love the cooks they're the BEST always  make us feel so special. Five thumbs up"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and really love it!  The prices are reasonable and the service is A++!  Great sake sampler and all of their choice of sushi is excellent.  They have a sense of humor with the names of their Rolls which makes it alittle embarrassing to order out loud in mixed company but FUN.  Like going here for larger groups as the hibachi chef's make it fun and their red fried rice is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Ate there with my son and Aunt on June 26 for dinner. Got the Hawaiian roll, Johnny roll, spicy tuna roll and my 21 year old son also got the steak and I don't recall which roll he had. My aunt and I shared the sushi so we ate the same thing and were fine, but my son woke up at 7am in the morning (with nothing else eaten between the time we ate at Geisha and the morn) VIOLENTLY vomiting. For the next 14 hours he had severe vomiting, sweats, joints seizing up, diarrhea and lethargy. TOTAL FOOD POISONING!! We almost rushed him to the ER at one point and when I called the restaurant all I got was a \"sorry about that\". Be very, very careful eating here. After this incident I placed a complaint with the state board of health and found out their other location has been on Dirty Dining for yep you guessed it, unsanitary food conditions and improper food handling. Also reading other yelp reviews I see others have gotten sick or experienced roaches and unsanitary conditions. Freakin grose!! Food was decent but seriously after witnessing what my son went through after eating there NEVER again!!"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I had a worse experience at a restaurant. 

First impressions show a well decorated swanky restaurant. The menu is small, although catered to hibachi, and the sushi menu leaves much to be desired. 

We had a party of nine sitting at the hibachi table, and while the chef was awesome and his personality made the experience a ton of fun, our actual server didn't even deserve her title. 90% of the time there were at least six empty drinks on the table. In a empty restaurant with MAYBE four other tables and plenty of servers, she had nothing but time on her hands to fill up our glasses. She didn't even have to actually bring out our food so what else would she possibly be occupied with that she neglected to give us proper service?
I finally talked to a manager and asked for him to fill our glasses, and told him the problems we were having. Unbeknownst to me, our lovely waitress had dropped our check off kindly letting us know the gratuity was already included. Mind you, we were in no rush, and hadn't even been asked if we would like dessert (which we all did). Again I talked to the manager, with him apologizing the whole time. Our waitress brought out dessert menus with an attitude, again neglecting to fill up our empty glasses. 
Long story short, after three hours of dinner, my water and tea were left empty for most of the night even after asking multiple times. The manager was no help, and obviously didn't really care about the service his resultant was giving. I have never been more disappointed and will NEVER go back again. The food was bland and the service would've been better if blind/deaf children were running it."}
{"text":"A great local gem in the southwest! My boo and I came here Friday night to catch the happy hour. I love that it goes late so that I'm still able to make it after work. 

They recently changed their happy hour offering to just drink specials and 30% off speciality rolls but it still ends up being a pretty good deal.

We ended up ordering a bottle of sake and three rolls and our bill was still under $50. Pretty good for a Friday night!

The only complaint I have is how slow the service is. It shouldn't take longer than 20 minutes for one roll. 

Other than that the food is great and always taste super fresh. I'll definitely be back to try the hibachi!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately after having eaten here many times I will never go back! Eating at the sushi bar and a cockroach crawled across the bar and onto my boyfriends dipping dish. We said something they removed it then proceeded to charge us for the full meal..... I guess we should be thankful for the free Moshi ice cream."}
{"text":"Loud music and good atmosphere.  Average sushi.  Everything seemed to be imparted with a lemon flavor.  We had at least a dozen different rolls and nothing was spectacular."}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars for the benefit of the doubt about the teppan offerings which we did not try--went only for sushi.  They have a incredibly large sushi menu, but only 2 or 3 items that said they do not contain crab--and I don't like crab.  I ordered gyoza, which appeared to be deep fried, and the yummy or yum-yum sushi, which claimed, on the menu, NOT to have crab.  When it arrived, it was filled with crab.  Both the waitress and the sushi chef told me 90% of the items contain crab--in fact they said it was IMITATION CRAB.  I had the chef make me something without crab, and it was OK, but am disappointed in the menu and the deceptive descriptions.  In addition, it seems to be a VIOLATION to serve imitation crab without indicating that on the menu.  I will be looking into the legality of this.

If you don't want crab, or krab, skip the sushi here.  I assume the offerings are the same at the other branches."}
{"text":"Great service.  The staff was very welcoming and the food was pretty good.  I highly recommend the 90% Roll & Geisha Roll had the freshest avocado incorporated into it.  I also got the $30 Geisha Special Hibachi Combo.  It came with a choice of wine or sake--which I picked sake-- ginger salad, soup, a hot plate of shrimp, chicken, steak & veggies and a side of rice.  The atmosphere was entertaining.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wait was super long, and nowhere to sit (since 4 people were sitting on the only bench). Waited 40 mins for our table. Really young waitstaff seemed confused. 
Hibachi (teppanyaki) was pretty good, but the price is comparable to other spots in Vegas that are better quality.

We would come back, though. Food was good and my steak was actually cooked the way I wanted, which is all that really matters."}
{"text":"So took a chance on a 3 1/2 stars and just to say we are 1 month new and So Cal(dont hate) and was impressed with the quality and service. I gave 5 stars based on quality, service and ambiance. Hidden gem in the north west. It will be our go to for sushi. Happy hour goes late and full bar!!!! Took a Lyft 5 minutes from the house."}
{"text":"Geisha House is one of our favorite spots to go! Each time we come for the Teppanyaki. We always have a great chef that delivers great food. Our chef tonight was Ryan. We have had him previous occasions. Very personable and great to talk to. He even made us some special sauces of his own design & they were delicious. We can't wait to come again very soon!"}
{"text":"SUSHI: BOMB  
I've eaten sushi all across this city & the sushi bar at this location is by far my FAVORITE. Not only are their rolls filled with flavor & prepared well but the customer service is like none other. Their awesome conversation is definitely what keeps bringing me & my family back to this spot. If the Head chef, Chris, is serving you be prepared to have your cheeks hurting from laughing so much. 
My personal favorites off the menu are the North Decatur, Fat Boy & Kiss of Fire. 
Their chicken fried rice from the hibachi makes my mouth water just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I went here for a nice lovely dinner on a Holiday and loved it. The host and staff were very helpful. From observing our table and the other tables, it seemed everyone was enjoying themselves and having a good time at the cooking tables.

 We ordered the specials and was very impressed with their Chefs, he was very talented and interacted with us and the food was good. 

By the way the name of the place is Kanji Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Wow. I guess we just had a really bad service  or the chefs simply sucked that night. We ordered Miso Soup for starters and that was the end of our service because the Miso Soup was sour and disgusting. SMH! 

Other than that the place is very beautiful and friendly staff. They apologize, however we will not be returning. First impression of taste of the food is everything, after all I go to Culinary School.

A year ago I rated this place a 1 star but it has definitely improve and their food is tasteful. I will definitely come back again. I rate this place a 4 star"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor: Take a Lyft and venture a few short minutes off the strip. Well worth your time, and great value, too They also worked with my gluten intolerance."}
{"text":"This place has fallen off a little. It used to be really good value for money when getting the Geisha Special, but not so much anymore. They are down to two pieces of shrimp and two pieces of vegetables in the tempura, only two shrimp in the appetizer, and the ginger sauce is not as good as it used to be. The service is really good however, but it typically has been. Still probably the best teppanyaki in town. And I did this for the free Mochi."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for years... So glad I finally got to eat here! The prices are good; the food was delicious; the chef was entertaining!  Overall, a great experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I normally come to geisha just for special occasions like birthdays and what not.  I decided to sit at the bar one day while I waited for the rest of my party. I'm so glad I did the bartenders Cody and Trevor were amazing. So friendly and knowledgeable.  I never ordered sushi before but cody recommended the double D and made it so appetizing I had to try it. I'm so glad I did it was so delicious. I used to only come in for the tepanyaki but now I come in for the sushi and bar. I'm so terrible instead of coming in 3 times a year I now come in once a week!!! Next time you come in sit at the bar with cody and Trevor they will treat you right and make your experience that much better even if it's one drink before your table reservation you won't regret it!!! Love it here thanx guys!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had great service! The food was perfectly cooked, and presented. The ginger sake mojitos is a must!!!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing , very friendly staff and cool environment. The reason I am giving 3 stars is the price and portion sizes. The portion sizes leave you still hungry. For 80$ they split 1 single chicken breast and 2 tiny pieces of filet mignon amongst me and my guest. As well we tipped the chef and the waiter adding another $20 to our invoice. I would not have minded the price point if I felt more full when leaving. Ended up eating something else a little later. Cute concept but would not go back due to portion size."}
{"text":"I would have given four stars but the menu has issues. I ordered he fantastic 4 because it said deep fried. Instead I received a raw roll that looked nothing like the picture on the menu. When I asked the waiter I was informed that the roll is raw and that the menu was incorrect. They didn't even offer to fry the roll. However, Jorge was the bomb!!! Very entertaining and the food he prepared was awesome. He is the only reason I'm giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"Overall great experience!! We made reservations for Valentine's day and it was great service no wait!! Food prices were perfect the sushi and the chefs at the grill were fun. Better then benihanas by far in pricing and interaction with the customers! Def a must go if your in town!"}
{"text":"SO delicious. I bring everyone here and I constantly crave their food (sushi, sliders, coconut shrimp, all of it). I am a very regular customer at Geisha House and usually have overall great experiences. 

Possibly my all-time favorite HH (4-8 every day with reverse HH most days of the week) in the bar/patio area (patio is nice in the cooler months). 

I had to give them 4 stars because every now and then we tend to have issues with the service; on more than one occasion they have forgotten about us and/or our drink or food order BUT tonight was an excellent experience. New server to us and he was great, even if the place was pretty dead (especially for a Saturday night). 

Anyways they have never let me down with their Lychee martini's and Waygu Sliders. 

Geisha House is just one of those places that is hit or miss on the service but you can't go wrong with the food and the vibe."}
{"text":"Just went there to have dinner with friends! Great atmosphere, good foods, and  wonderful customer service! Best teppanyaki in Las Vegas! Must try~~~"}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, they have the best sushi and rolls in Las Vegas.  I have never actually sat down to eat, but it is a very nice environment as well.  I think they have a DJ after 10pm.

As for the cooked food, I haven't tried.  But it seems like it is a Bennehanna style of cooking.  Not really my cup of tea.  But smells yummy."}
{"text":"We love the table cooking here and give it 4 stars but dont come for the sushi. We love Sushi Wow for the rolls, but we like Sushi Tachi for the ll you can eat nigiri"}
{"text":"First time here, great steak ! ! 

very quiet atmosphere , when we dine here"}
{"text":"No sushi menu, no back support at table, place is small. Food was good and service quick, will not be returning because of no sushi and back hurt 5 min into dinner"}
{"text":"Pretty good tepanyaki experience.  The geisha house fried rice is quite good. Definitely one of the best places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Second time I've eaten here in the last month......The staff is very friendly but it seemed like there was a problem with everything .....First the waitress forgot our drinks.....then she bought out the wrong appetizers....Our chef was very good...Food was good but a little pricey for what you get...We had a groupon which also was a problem because the waitress did not know how to take it off our bill..."}
{"text":"Loved our first visit here, loved everything about the place - ambience, decor, service, quality of the food and the creative dishes. I was quite surprised actually when we first entered, had no idea it was that spacious and beautifully done from the billboard outside. Nice drinks, great sushi, some good ol football on a giant screen, I really enjoyed the place!"}
{"text":"Geisha House is misunderstood.  Browsing the reviews listed here, you see reviews about shabu shabu, their teppanyaki, or the naked sushi events.  This is the first place I tried shabu shabu, and I enjoyed it, but they stopped doing that about five years ago.  The teppanyaki seems to get pretty good ratings from other reviewers; I've never had it.  And the naked sushi...well, I went after purchasing the Groupon, and if that is your introduction to the sushi at Geisha House I can understand why people wouldn't want to return.  So why do I still think Geisha House deserves a second chance?  The sushi bar!  Let me explain...

Take a look at their sushi menu: http://www.geishasteakhouse.co.kr/geisha/sushi/.  The food I've ordered actually looks pretty darn close to those pictures.  They know that presentation is part of the experience, and put in the effort to present your dish the way it was meant to be.  As far as the quality of the fish, the sushi chef has always been upfront with me when I ask what's fresh.  \"Today we just got in some toro.\"  \"Don't get the uni, we haven't had a recent shipment.\"  \"I suggest getting the yellowtail and albacore, it's really good quality today.\"  

Totally honest with the recommendations!  Really, who tells you not to order something, or admits that an item at their restaurant isn't fresh?  One night I was finishing up dinner, and I saw the sushi chef preparing a large variety of sashimi.  I asked about it, and he said that when he gets a shipment in he prepares samples for the waitstaff so that they know exactly what they're talking about when customers ask for recommendations, or ask how different fish taste.  It's this kind of service that I really appreciate, instead of being told the standard, \"Oh, everything is good.\"

If you went to a naked sushi event, give them another chance.  Seriously.  Sit at the sushi bar.  Ask questions.  Enjoy the service, quality, presentation, and most importantly, let's all pretend naked sushi never happened."}
{"text":"Our sushi chef CHRIS is an absolute rock star! He makes every visit special. We come 1/week. The sushi is wonderful. Half off sake bottles all day. Happy hour 5-7 is nice. Owners/managers...do whatever it takes to keep and get more people like Chris... he really makes each visit worthwhile. Do not loose him!"}
{"text":"I liked their service and sushi! I don't care what others saying bad about this place..they have good food and good special prices.
Also, I like their naked sushi event as well too...it's something you'll not going to see anywhere..new experience to me.
It's always nice to have new experience...I like this place!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one in South location but I wanted to try North location this time so me and my family went there on last Friday. There was lot of B-day party tables when we got there..very friendly ambience and togetherness.
I really don't have a good experience with Teppanyaki at another place so really didn't want to try that but my family wanted to try their Teppanyaki so we ordered some beef,sea food and sushi.
When the Teppanyaki Chef came out and show us his skills..it was lot of fun and the food he made was impressed!! I was like...WOW!! It wasn't nothing like the one I tried at another place..
And their sushi was so fresh and good too!!
We really loved their service and food! It was worth it to go to that location even tho it was really far from where I live..I would go to that location again :)"}
{"text":"I drug my fiance (kicking and screaming mind you...) here tonight for dinner.  I had dined at Geisha years ago when it was at DI and Durango, but since moving to Rhodes have been dying to go back.

We call ahead for reservations, place them with ease for 7:30, and dressed up for the evening (sometimes its nice for no apparent reason).  We arrive at Geisha around 7:00pm and are easily seated early, even though the place is relatively crowded.  (Fun sidenote:  My name is \"Rich\", which is the name I used to place the reservation, but \"Witch\" was written in the reservation book when we got there.  God Bless the Japanese accent!).  

Service is immediately stellar.  We are seated, drinks are ordered, soup and salad are in front of us within 4 minutes.  Everyone is friendly and smiling, they had a rotating group of employee's coming by fairly frequently, but not enough to annoy, to check on our experience.

Our chef comes out, I regret not catching his name, and is incredibly pleasant and quite skilled. I love Teppanyaki for the show, and the food is a bonus.  He does all of the usual tricks and portions are huge.  

I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was perfectly seared, perfectly seasoned.  The fried rice had a red tint that I had not seen before, but the flavor was amazing.  The vegetables were killer, the shrimp - to die for!

Michelle ordered the Chicken and had them add Seasame seeds, a good choice.  This was arguably the best chicken I have ever tasted.  We had plenty of food to share amongst each other.  A great food experience!

I have found a new local favorite and will be back.  Total bill:  Filet Mignon, Chicken, 2 soda's - $56.  A steal for the quality!"}
{"text":"Great place nice atmosphere clean, food presentation is great prices are where they need to be for what you're getting service was at an all-time premium ask for Chuck."}
{"text":"What can I say... This place is fabulous! From the moment we arrived we felt like they actually wanted us there!  The food was great, the service was by far THE BEST we have had in a very long time and the atmosphere is stunning. 

The management and staff are fantastic and if you haven't been here you should definitely go. We will definitely be returning. Thank you Geisha House for finally getting it right and we look forward to seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"The best Thanksgiving is having sushi...Me and the hubby don't like the traditional Thanksgiving food simply because it's just too much food and we don't like turkey.
Because our favorite sushi place wasn't open we decided to try Geisha Sushi.
At this restaurant, there is a tepanyaki side and a sushi side.  We ate at the sushi side by the bar with the flat screens.
We ordered the rainbow sashimi salad, miso soup, and salmon, spicy scallop, yellow tail, and egg sushi.  
All very fresh to the palate and the miso soup was thick.  
Service was very good and maybe because it was Thanksgiving they gave us extra pieces of the sushi nigiri.
This will be a good Thanksgiving tradition!"}
{"text":"Great place hubby and I like to go to for date night. Chris is amazing at creating rolls that are not on the menu!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to check out Geisha House for months because all of the rave reviews on Yelp! My expectations were somewhat higher than usual simply because of all the great reviews. Although, I had an absolutely horrible experience. The server didnt seem interested in waiting on our table. We waited a good 5-8 minutes before she greeted us. I did order some wine which I enjoyed but honestly that was the only good part of my meal. I decided to get sushi and my date ordered a meal. His meal came out within a reasonable amount of time, but we were not impressed. I ended up not getting half of my sushi. I told the server I would just go through a drive-thru and gave up after waiting for them to correct it. Our bill was $70 & I didnt even get my sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Danny the chef was awersom and very entertaining! The food was good but not great. The portions were small (vegetables mostly) but adequate. The filet was fab!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The good, atmosphere and service can not be beat. Prices are reasonable for the good quality food you get which makes this a fantastic place for anything from date night to just a nice relaxing dinner alone.
I can not say enough about the service! Just wonderful and so attentive. We will be making this a regular dining experience."}

{"text":"Always great food but always a terrible experience with customer service. This time was the last straw and I will never go there again. It's my friends birthday party. I called to make a reservation for 23 people. They told me they will charge me $200 for the table. This is in addition to our food etc... This was a fee just to sit down!!! I can't believe the nerve they have. What a terrible way to do business. This is not a nightclub! It doesn't include bottle service! It doesn't even include a jar of vasoline for getting screwed!! We are taking our party elsewhere and they are losing approx $1500 because they are terrible business people! What a bunch of idiots! 
I have had other experiences at other locations when we had smaller parties and they would not let us sit until our entire party was there! And in doing so, they lost money because we would be ordering drinks while we wait for our other friends to arrive. We could not sit at the bar because some of our party was underage. 
Another time I made a reservation and when I got there they did not have a reservation for me and they told us we could wait an hour to seat 8 people because they couldn't seat us all even though the place was practically empty!
Another time they told us they couldn't seat us at a tappan table because some of us wanted to order sushi and we are only allowed to sit there if we order tappan. Learn how to run a resteraunt people!!"}
{"text":"Went there for Naked Sushi. Concept is great, execution was poor. Not to burst any bubbles, but the \"naked sushi ladies\" are hardly part of the event. They lay far off to the side surrounded by the food which is served buffet style. If you are wanting an experience, give it a try. If you are wanting good food & service, try a different AYCE place. I can only comment on their \"Naked Sushi Night.\" Maybe their normal service & food  is better."}
{"text":"My first time and first experienced at Geisha House was Awesom!!! I very like the looks inside the place. It was only first time that I allowed \"me\" to try any raw meat beside the Oysters. i found myself sitting and had the first bit of the fish without gagging! lol (I'm really bad on that) the fish all very fresh and delicious! I really enjoyed my sushi and my Ginger Sake drinks:) I was sat at the bar and I'm not sure if I remember my server but I think it was Ryan, he was really cool! I am planing on get all my whole gang together and we'll slam the Geisha House very soon!
Ps. The location! It's very easy to fine."}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful experience here! I had a girls night out & this was the perfect location. It wasn't just an amazing dinner...it was a fun atmosphere with entertainment & fantastic drinks. I got the land lover special, which I thought was a little on the pricey side, until I realized how much I got. I would definitely suggest their specials because you get a soup, salad, appetizer, 3 types of meat, fried rice & wine or sake. This place is great for family, friends or a date. I even saw people with kids here & they were as fascinated as the adults by the hibachi chefs. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great service every time I in. The sushi chef has been the only friendly sushi chef I have ran into for awhile. Also knew exactly what I meant when I explained a roll that Smiths has usually and made it 10 times better. The other places would act like they did not know what I was talking about. Will come here again."}
{"text":"The food was way over priced and not that great for what your paying. I felt as though the waiter was going to steal my baby always hovering over her. Place was empty and I can see why. Although I will say I like the restaurants concept and how it looks. Just not satisfied overall with food quality, pricing and customer service."}
{"text":"I have tried to go to this restaurant three times. The first time it was closed for whatever reason. The second time we had called to see what time they were opening for lunch and the employee rudely told us they wouldn't be open until dinner. The third time they were closed for \"renovations\" (probably health code violations).

Three strikes you're out...Go to Swish on Spring Mountain instead...they ARE OPEN."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! Eddy is awesome and the food is always fantastic. I definitely recommend this place!! Always good"}
{"text":"Very good food! And the chef put on a fun show cooking our dinners. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I think the appetizers were amazing however after they served that it took 30 minutes for our food to come out and by then we had already been there for an hour. We had our son with us and he was getting fussy and all the wait staff kept looking at us like can you leave already.. then they brought us our food and we asked for To-go boxes because our son was getting ready to scream and they acted upset that we wanted to leave after waiting 30 minutes to even get our food. Our waitress only came to our table once and we had to ask the bus boy to get her for our bill..finally after we got home and opened our food my food was undercooked and the waitress didn't correctly describe the vegetables that came with it..  needless to say we won't be going back.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It is a roll based Sushi restaurant. No sashimi here on the menu. Still it is ridiculously good. 

The service is good and you get more than an orange for dessert. 

Lunch saves you a few bucks but you don't get Uni or sweet shrimp."}
{"text":"All I have to say is ...

PINK RICE. 

Give me all the pink rice. 
I dream about their pink rice. 
Food is delicious, service is good... But I keep going back for the pink rice!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night and waited for someone to decide to help us. Lots of staff just walked by till finally someone came and helped us. There were visably at least 5 or 6 available tables but still we were told a 30-45 minute wait? really? we went across the street and got a table right away. This place is pretty but that seems about it all it has to offer."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is amazing and the cooks are funny and friendly. I go here often."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi! We ordered the touchdown roll and japanese lasagna great rolls Iwould really recomend this place for the food, only issue I had was that the server told us about happy hour was until 9 but it was only till 8pm so we where late by a few minutea thinking we had a whole hour, overall service was great"}
{"text":"By far...my favorite happy hour in all of Las Vegas!!! Great drinks and sushi at happy hour prices?!? I'm always in! My faves here are the Blue Ninja (a fishbowl drink with a tropical fruity coconutty flavor and a big chunk of dry ice for that bit of eye catching most of witches brew lol, $18) and for sushi the Hot Night Roll and Harijuku Girls Roll (I forget what's in them but trust me it's good! $14ea)   We usually frequent this establishment on Saturdays for happy hour and we average about $75 for the both of us...sounds kinda pricey for an off the strip sushi place but we usually fill up on sushi and drinks and get at least 4 rolls and 4 drinks. Right now they don't have a solid sushi happy hour menu. I guess they are revamping their Happy Hour...sooooo everything inside the sushi menu is 30% off!!!! Agggghhhhhhh! My eyes lit up like a kid in the candy store!!! I got a chance to taste just about every roll on that menu and they're all great! We've yet to try out Teppanyaki here. It's actually the more popular reason for this place but from what I see they are great entertaining chefs! I love you Geisha House! 

P.S. Robert is the best Bartender ever in life!"}
{"text":"Dined here last night for happy hour with my friends. The food was good however the service was extremely slow I ordered a drink that took over 15 mins to come. All of food came before my drink how is that possible when it's not even busy? The ambiance is nice and it's a very cute setting however the service was mediocre. I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Come see Danny!! He was great! Funny and energetic! The food was amazing as always! The cocktails were delicious! The poor bartender was by himself and took him awhile to make drinks but well worth the wait! I love this place and the happy hour is great as well. Our new spot after working out at Ilovekickboxing! ;)"}
{"text":"Completely over priced. Panda express taste better, the food is cheap and low quality don't waste your money here. Everything taste VERY low quality"}
{"text":"I decided to treat Soralala to dinner for her birthday but when we got to Geisha House around 10:30 we found out the dining room had just closed.. aww no probs because their bar/lounge/patio area is pretty nice.. actually their whole restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing! We chose to sit in a cute little love seat and were greeted by the pretty bartender, Marissa.. We were then told that after 10:30 only the Happy Hour menu is available.. another bummer but not a big deal because their HH has a handful of light bites and yummy dranks which is what we were looking to do anyways.
The general manager, Christian, then came over to us and checked our IDs and realized it was Sora's birthday and convinced us to move to the bar and enjoy a round of shots on him ;]]] 

We tried a lot of yummy items:
- Pork belly skewers: Sora really liked these! They come with 3-4 little pieces of pork belly accompanied by a couple pearl onions. They did not quite melt in your mouth but they packed good flavor.
- Mixed tempura: Came with like 3 pieces of shrimp and 2 pieces of veggies. Was not oily and stayed crunchy.
-Lamb Lollipops: Came with 2 pieces. I enjoyed these.. they were not overly gamey at all. However, Sora thought they were a bit over-cooked. 
-Something's Wrong Roll: I would have liked this one better if it was not deep-fried.
- Salmon Carpaccio: SO SO SO SO GOOD! The salmon was so buttery and fresh. Plus it comes with pretty edible flowers that have a citrus taste to them. Best part is that dish is only $5 on their HH.

-Lychee Martini: Marissa made this one so DELISH. Not overly sweet and the pretty edible flower finishes it off so well! 
-Ginger Sake Mojito: Excellent twist on the mojito! Lots of fresh mint leaves!
-Geisha Blessing: beautiful green colored rum cocktail topped with thick whipped cream... meant to drink without a straw so that the flavors compliment each other.. sure to give you a cute creamstache lol
-Cucumber cocktail: OMG to die. so refreshing!!! Definitely our fav of the night!
-Bubble-wrap cocktail: Featured on the Las Vegas Weekly and Seven Magazine. Very creative cocktail.. Something in the ingredients causes the cocktail to start to bubble and resemble bubble-wrap. Fun drink, comes in a huge glass.. Tastes like creamy coconut milk~ 
-Shots: They have a full bar so we also had some Vegas Bomb Shots and Sora requested a special shot and they had no problem following her directions and whipping it out for us. 

This location just opened so it was pretty empty when we got there.. But Marissa and Christian were very friendly and kept us company. As you can see, by the time we left we were quite happy and satisfied. I can't wait to go back for another Happy Hour session and also to check out their main dining room! 

HOT TIP: Ask for the GM, Christian, to show you his flair bartending tricks... he's amazing! Also, they host many special themed events in their lounge where they have a DJ and hookah.. such as Latin nights and Naked Sushi... They even do comped bottles for groups of ladies ;]]]"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic sushi dinning experience. We sat at the sushi bar and had Gonzo as our chef. We started with the spicy garlic edamame and seaweed salad. Delish! Moved on to nigiri, garlic tuna and a seasoned seared albacore. So fresh and tasty. Then we had a hamachi kama that was cooked perfect and had a little ponzu with it, yummers! Then tuna sashimi, the screaming O! and finally a spicy yellow tail roll with jalapeno. Beautiful presentation with an edible orchid. And we were given a complimentary chocolate truffle before the check!
So happy that this location has opened. Its a beautiful restaurant with a patio bar that we cant wait to enjoy when the weather is nicer.  Also, we will try the tappanyaki, the table cooking, next time!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was in the doghouse for several weeks before getting the bright idea to take me out. This place is amazing. I love the decor and the ambiance. Our chef was Felix and he was awesome with us. We came on a week day so it wasn't packed. Sushi was great and the food was even better. The boyfriend was a little distracted because of the huge screen tv at the bar but what man isn't when the sports channel is on. I will be returning..."}
{"text":"This is the best Hibachi table restaurant in the Vegas Valley. I have been to at least a dozen, but this one easily wins that title.

No, this place isn't in the most desirable end of town. Desert Inn and Sandhill - there is no denying this is a dumpy part of town. The place is even in a suite in a shopping center next to a Mexican church. No joke. 

But the food here is to die for, and the staff are all excellent, with a good sense of humor. I have had the chicken and steak dishes they have to offer - all come out excellent. The fried rice is the best in town, and the other items won't fail to please either. It's good to see a restaurant that isn't so obsessed with decorating their restaurant that it comes at the expense of food. 

This place is always welcoming. I admit, I'm not a huge fan of the \"all red\" lighting scheme in here, but it's a small price to pay for great food. Max, the guy who almost always cooks for me and my family, has a great personality and cooking skills alike. I don't think I have ever come in here and been dissatisfied, even if someone else was cooking for us. 

Yes, this place is in a bad part of town. But it's worth going to nonetheless. For top-notch Hibachi table dining with great service, look no further than this all-too-often overlooked hole-in-the-wall of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Completely loved the experience Ryan was awesome! Jordan got us seated within minutes with a great smile!! Definitely recommending this place with the service received"}
{"text":"This place committed just about all of the worse offenses a restaurant can. First, my group's waiter seemed to be bothered by us because we walked in when the place was empty (you'd think they would be excited to have a chance to make a tip). Second, I ordered the spicy scallop roll and after eating one piece of it I called the waiter over and told them that the scallop was bad (rancid!). My tables waiter then proceeded to yell over to the sushi chef that I said the scallops were not bad, and the chef argued with me. Now, this is when I got extremely P.O.ed and told them to take the roll back, don't bring anything else, and don't charge me. Lucky they agreed or they would have been hearing from me again the next day when I was sick to my stomach. I can only imagine what would have happened to me had I eaten more than one piece...Don't risk your life by trying this dive..."}
{"text":"My waiter handed me off to another waiter. Both waiter rushed me into ordering. I ordered Double D sushi it was good. My gyoza came with a sauce that tasted like tomato soup/ketchup. 


I probably won't return. The bad out weighed the good."}
{"text":"Shabu shabu, aka hot pot, aka Asian fondue, has returned to S. Fort Apache Road!

The Geisha Corporation has opened up their fourth restaurant with the name of \"Little Geisha Shabu Shabu.\"  Taking over this huge space once owned by Nina's, Little Geisha offers hot pot, sukiyaki, and something called Genghis Khan shabu shabu.

For $13.95, you can have the Prime Rib Eye Shabu Shabu, which also comes with a platter of veggies including udon noodles.  Two dipping sauces accompany this dinner, the first being a ponzu and the other possibly being of a sesame variety.  After cooking your meat and veggies in the hot broth, dip your food into both sauces before consuming.  Its all the flavor you'll ever want!  For $14.95, you can have the Prime Rib Eye Sukiyaki dinner, which also comes with a platter of veggies, udon noodles, and a raw egg.  Their sukiyaki sauce has quite a bit of flavor and the BF was impressed with their concoction.  They pour this stuff into a hot pan and start cooking your food in this sauce.  All dinners come with a bowl of rice and a couple of side dishes of kim chee and pickled goodies.  Be sure to add the garlic, radish, and green onions to your shabu shabu or sukiyaki, it adds a lot more flavor overall.

Feel free to ask for more rice, kim chee, and pickled stuff since there's no additional charge for it.  (Double check though!)  The BF and I left pretty full, and it appears they offer a bit more veggies than Swish does.

Business is still slow at this location since there's not too much traffic yet around here.  We were the only ones there at 7 pm, but by the time we left, three other parties had joined us.  Employees were helpful in cooking practically all our food for us, and I wasn't sure if this was standard practice or because they were so slow.  (I can't imagine how they could cook everyone's stuff for them if they were packed.)  It can feel a bit rushed when they do all the cooking for you, so feel free to tell them you can take over at any time.  It can get messy with them picking out all your food for you, but depending on your chopsticks skill, maybe you do want them to do it for you.

They also offer plenty of tables for those not interested in cooking up their own food.  It's a pretty small and straightforward menu at Little Geisha.  Let's see if they can last longer than Nina's did!"}
{"text":"I have eaten her twice. I have been absolutely Pleased both times. Beautiful atmosphere. Staff is very accommodating. Food was delicious at a fair price. We even got free Sake Bombs from our Hostess, since we were a little lost on the way there... An amazing Experience for my little sisters 19th Birthday! I will definitely return!!
DEVI was an awesome waitress.. Super Sweet Lady!!
Love the Staff!!! You guys are all GREAT."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my mom and sister during a little break we had. We got there when it wasn't so busy, then it got pretty busy a few minutes later. But I have to say, the food was deeeeelicious! We ordered two rolls of sushi and my mom and I each ordered a lunch box special. I really wish I remembered the names of our meals, but I have terrible memory! And I really wish I remembered the name of our server because he was fabulous! Our food came out pretty fast and the service was was good also. I liked the food so much that I ordered a sushi roll togo to bring to work! Lol. I have yet to try the teppanyaki though! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Spent the evening at Geisha House in Las Vegas with local friends who live in Vegas. The atmosphere was very cool. It was a sexy modern asian theme and very nice. We had leche martinis and they were awesome. We tried all the appetizers and every one was better than the next. We definitely visit there again when we return in the Fall."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ginger sake mojito with candied ginger garnish. Only $6 at happy hour. Our kids have been to several habachi grills but this was the best show-- the chef had a lot of silly props and jokes. When he chopped the egg we took turns catching i with no hands. Loved the sushi with spicy salmon too.  I wish happy hour specials applied in the restaurant too since our kids couldn't come in the bar. If you  order geisha beer on tap be prepared for the worlds lightest beer."}
{"text":"Never again!
The food was cheap ($25 for 5 rolls) but the service was awful. I guess you get what you pay for:
1) the servers will yell across the room at each other. This is a sushi restaurant, not a bar!
2) they have no shame in reaching across your face (arm right in face) to drop off the plates. Yes drop- it was definitely not subtle how they did it.
3) the server insisted to box my food for me, even after I declined. She dropped a piece of fish and I told her not to worry about that. Then...she drops another piece...and picks both up from the table and stuffs it into the to go box. Gross!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. We came here a week ago to celebrate my Birthday. I'm still newer to town, unlike my roommates and even though it had been a few months since they had eaten here the waiters remember them all too well, they remembered their typical orders; both food and drinks. The food is always tasty and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"The wife and I were looking for a good habachi restaurant of the strip, and found this spot. 
 We went in around 9 pm on Wednesday night. There was only one other table full, the place was empty. The service was fast and very attentive.
  I ordered the combo, chicken, filet, and lobster. The special came with a small saki and appetizer for $35.
  The chef was very nice, average table skills. He started with the fried rice, and the house seasoned butter was a very nice change. The fried rice was excellent, good flavor. I ordered my filet rare, and it was cooked perfect. Seasoned well and tasted great. My chicken and lobster both were over cooked however. 
  Overall a good experience, even better price. We will return, hopefully next time my lobster will not be over cooked."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very large and spacious interior. Upon entering you feel like you're in a chic ultra lounge. My friend and I came in at 6 pm on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy. Our waitress offered us their special roll of the night. The way she described it made it sound awesome so we went with it. We also ordered the lamb lollipops, edamame, shrimp tempura crunch roll, and the crab stuffed mushrooms. 

The special roll wasn't that special to us, it was more like a dud. It didn't have a lot of flavor and the sauce that accompanied it did not help. The fish used for it wasn't that great either. The lamb lollipops seemed a bit too fatty. Every bite was extremely chewy and consisted of fat so it wasn't that appealing while eating it. The bed of stringed carrots underneath the lamb lollipops did not taste so good either. Our favorites were the shrimp tempura crunch roll and the stuffed mushrooms. Both excellent in flavor and texture! It was also kind of strange that our sushi dishes did not come with any ginger and wasabi. When I requested for it the waitress just brought me back a bowl of pickled wasabi. Something I'm not so familiar with. I tried it and wasn't too fond of it. 

The staff was great overall. Our busser was most attentive, always coming by asking if we wanted our glasses refilled and if plates needed to be taken away. We were also given free mochi for checking in on yelp which is pretty sweet. My friend and I were considering going to the happy hour since they appear to have awesome deals, but this location is quite a drive from us since we live all the way in boulder city. I'm not sure how often I'd return here since I wasn't so impressed as I thought I would be."}
{"text":"This place is great, and located in a nice neighborhood. We decided to order the NY steak and scallops, with an appetizer, instead of the larger deal (which included dessert) that the waiter suggested. It was actually plenty of food for two, and we had no room for any dessert. As an appetizer, we had the shrimp tempura, and they had a cream cheese stuffing. They were delicious, and about 6 per serving. The steak was solid, though a bit overdone for my taste (I asked for medium). The scallops were buttery and delicious. The fried rice was the best part! They use a special butter with which to fry it, and it is to die for! Our chef was very entertaining too. Overall, it is a great place with good ambiance, and a friendly staff. I will be coming back many times."}
{"text":"I've been trying out a lot of different spots, absolutely loved the sushi and apps here! Fresh delicious and clean!!!"}
{"text":"3 stars here. Places like Geisha House with the hibachi are one of my favorite places to eat. Unfortunately my wife is not fond of the food, so I rarely get to go. Last night my wife was generous and suffered through it. Geisha is good but not my favorite. It is our first try since moving to vegas. The biggest issue I had was they did not introduce enough favors to the rice, not sure exactly what it was missing but it just wasn't as good as I remember elsewhere. I was also not thrilled with the vegetable selection, my favorite is the zucchini and I got hardly any on my plate. The price is quite steep, but that is commonplace at establishments like this. Their ginger dressing on the salad is actually not that tasty. Overall I was disappointed and not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"Came here for my sister's birthday celebration and what a great experience! I had a big group and it was all our first time so we came here during happy hour to try out their selection. This location delivered phenomenal service! Every person was taken care of and dishes came out in a timely manner. I started with the white peach sake which could go through a couple rounds among 3 people. It was so delicious--I may have to order a whole bottle to myself next time! Items on the menu were fairly priced with great portions. I tried the lamb chop lollipops which wefe so tender and delicious. A few friends of mine tried the geisha special where they cooked the items in a grill right before your eyes. What a great variety with shrimp, chicken, lobster and filet mignon which were cooked tonperfection. After a few hours we decided to hang out by the bar and order drinks. The staff were very friendly and the managers were so attentive coming by to check up on our group. I honestly cannot wait to go back to the whole teppenyaki experience and naked sushi!"}
{"text":"One of the best teppanyaki places I have ever been to! The environment is amazing and same with their deals (half off wine Wednesday, half off sake Sunday's)
-the chef Will was incredible, he made the environment very comfortable, kept professionalism, and kept everyone happy!
-honestly one of the greatest date experiences I have ever been to! I recommend the shrimp, the lobster, and the honey toast for your experience! All was amazing :) thank you Geisha house! I will be back!"}
{"text":"went here for my birthday dinner with the fiancé & we had the chef's selection 7 course meal. it was absolutely delicious and included the ff:
-seafood sashimi salad- tuna/salmon/yellowtail, house blend dressing. from this first course you could immediately taste the quality of the -seafood, the fish was succulent and sweet.
-asparagus rolls- asparagus and pull porked wrapped in a crispy soy paper over a bed of crispy noodles, perfect balance of sweet and spicy.
-sashimi selection- another beautiful plate of fresh, sweet seafood.
-grilled lamb lollipop- tender, juicy, succulent, not that gamy. perfectly seasoned
-sushi nigiri trio- same as previous comments
-grilled filet with mash/asparagus- favorite part of the entire meal. steak was a perfect medium, melt in your mouth delicious. 
-brick toast- genius combination that is a perfect ending to such a wonderful meal. not overly sweet but sweet enough to be a dessert.

LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT TID BIT- impeccable customer service. like Nordstrom for restaurants. our server was DEVI and she is fantastic!!!!!!! super attentive, hilarious and friendly. she made my birthday dinner more memorable."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 5 - the area is really open and intimate! there are large booths, sushi bar, bar area w/ 2 sports screens, hibachi (which is really cheap--37 to 40 bucks), private area..this place is pretty big! and it looks like a cool, modern Asian club ;) 

SERVICE: 5 - the service was really great! there wasn't a huge amount of people so they catered to everyone really well! the manager was always walking around checking on everyone, and the servers are really prompt! 

FOOD: 4 - It was really good and fresh! the sliders I really liked and a lot of the sushi rolls! the love roll is my favorite, it doesn't have rice :) I've had better, but this was pretty good!

I'll have to come back next time and try the hibachi! 

Local specific info: make reservations! buy the groupon! (if still available) try sake or a special cocktail!!"}
{"text":"Reservation was at 8:30pm we got sat after 9:00. Almost 10:00 and the chef hasn't came out yet"}
{"text":"The design/decor wasn't that great. It was just one big open space. They are definitely over priced (but we knew that before coming here) Service was very good though. We ordered the geisha special and the appetizer was bigger then I had expected (I ordered the shrimp tempura).  It was verry yummy.  I loved the soup and salad. I just would've liked the salad to be a little bigger in portion size. 

Over all the dinner was great and sure I'd go back on a rare occasion, but yes it's pricey."}
{"text":"If someone from your restaurant actually reads these reviews, well you better sit down....

We live just down the street and the 3 or 4 of us in my family comes here every couple of weeks, and you have gotten worse each and every time!

Salad - So let's see, your salad is small, wilted and the tomatoes were actually frozen on 2 of our salads.  It appears the salads are prepped and frozen WITH the dressing already on it.  

Combination Tempura - Your combination tempura used to have nice good size pieces of shrimp (usually 2 or 3 pieces), now they are small, you used to have broccoli, or sweet potato or even carrot, not you're using string beans and bok choy and 3 out of the 4 of us couldn't even eat the boy choy it was so stringy like celery.  REALLY???? You're that damm cheap???

Hibachi - Talk about a small piece of chicken.  I think that chicken breast was 2 MAYBE 3 ounces.  I get bigger and more chicken at kfc for their $5 buck lunch! No I'm not over reacting either.

Vegetable, I remember going to hibachi restaurants for years that half your plate was full of nice big pieces of sliced vegetables (zucchini, mushrooms, onions etc) including bean sprouts. Now it's about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of vegetables per person. Um hey guys, vegetables are cheap and they're good for you. You don't have to be stingy!!

Rice - FINALLY something GREAT.  The rice here is wonderful, no doubt about it.  But wait.. $35+ for the geisha special and the only great thing is RICE??? Definitely something wrong with this..

Hibachi Show - The show is VERY hit and miss each visit and we saw every chef   do different things, some didn't even do anything except cook, nothin special or anything.  

Inappropriate - During your fire show, most of the chefs use a little squeeze water boy that pees out the fire with water.  As an adult, it's cute, funny. I love it.  Most times there are families and kids at the table and YES this is inappropriate, especially if you're a family restaurant.

Total bill $178 for 4 people (we all had the sea special) 

2 days later, I came back in for Happy Hour with a Groupon.  I've never had your sushi before or Happy Hour and that's why I bought the groupon. The value was for $30.  I sat down at the bar by myself showed the bartender/server my groupon and made sure everything was going to be ok. She said I have to have 2 people. I asked why?? It doesn't change anything, the groupon has a set value for $30. What does it matter who's mouth the food goes into? It doesn't change the value!!!  She told me again that's just the way it is. I told her she needs to get a manager then because that makes no sense and I was just in here 2 days ago and spent $178 ...
She said the manager will allow it this time.. (I looked around and the place MAYBE had 15-20 people in there.  Glad to see the manager made a good decision and allowed it and didn't lose my business that evening.  

I ordered a variety of rolls. They were fine, nothin great by any means and definitely NOT ever worth the price they are asking for their sushi either!!!  $7 for a shrimp tempura roll, $15+ for specialty rolls. Um there are a TON of really great all you can eat sushi bars all over the city, Your sushi menu/prices are not at all worth it. 

So... I heard that Kanji just down the street took over the old Geisha location on ft apache between russell and sunset and they are getting great reviews on their hibachi oh AND they have All you can eat sushi AND they are getting great reviews.

My next visit will be to Kanji to try them out.  If their fried rice is good too (which people seem to be enjoying over there) I will no longer go back to Geisha (not even for a to go order of yummy fried rice).  Sorry Geisha you are going down hill and are getting cheap, stingy and over priced for the quality/amount of food and lack of service.

Every visit we've seen less and less people in your restaurant. 

BYE....."}
{"text":"Business mixer was the event that drew me into the Geisha House. Atmosphere,  decor and fantastic service was the first impression and the impression was a great one. The appetizers I sampled were delicious. The spring rolls and sushi rolls were spot on perfect. Vibrant flavors, visually appealing and so fresh. Definitely a crowd pleasing menu.  Looking forward to coming back for a proper dinner soon."}
{"text":"Was here a couple weeks ago for a hibachi lunch date. Having been to a few hibachi places here in town, this place is pretty much your standard run of the mill one. Nothing special to really say about it.
However, the chef was super friendly and interacted with everyone at the table great. The chicken and steak we ordered were good quality and cooked right, and overall I left full and happy, no complaints here."}
{"text":"We all sat at hibachi table. Had NY steak, filet mignon, lobster, shrimp and scallop. Lobster was a bit over cooked. All other items were nicely cooked and tasty.  Hibachi was fun for my guests. Love the mint sake mojito.  Mentioned one guest had his birthday this week. They send a green tea ice cream with a candle complimentary, very nice gesture. Service was prompt and cocktail orders were taken ASAP as well."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I all went to here for dinner and ended up leaving before we even ordered drinks. Why? Because a cockroach crawled out of our menu! I do not recommend eating here if the roaches are crawling around so freely. The worst part was when we told the waitress she just shrugged and walked away from us. If I could leave no stars I would"}
{"text":"They do not have traditional Japanese food.  The service is not to good the American waitress had trouble understanding English.   They brought us soup and it took 10 minutes to get us spoons and by then the soup was cold."}
{"text":"Coming here was a spur of the moment decision. We had our 4 young kiddos with us and were wanting to celebrate our 13 year wedding anniversary so we splurged and decided to go inside and check it out.  It was a lot of fun, but a lot of food for my young 'uns.  So.. we brought home quite a bit.  We did have my youngest two (ages 5 5 and 6) share a meal.  I love the pink rice and I love the soup that comes with the meal.  The show was so-so. Our cook had a few problems flipping his egg. Oh well.. I think he was a newbie.  I have had better at other Teppanyaki places, but the kids were very impressed. We would go again, but it will not be anytime soon!"}
{"text":"very nice...introduced an out of area friend because he was craving seafood.. and what a better way to enjoy a lobster/shrimp or lobster/scallops i do not knowi have to say the lobster portion was stingy and believe it or not.. less tender than the shrimp... the pink butter thing is really so played and for a person who is very fastidious and hung up on texture and looks.. i think the ownership really needs to take a hard look at this silly novelty... my teppan cook was very accomodating and separated my fried rice and seafood from the other gathered and their technicolor spectacle of food.. 

respectfully"}
{"text":"We've been here twice in less then a month. This is the mans new spot he said. He LOVES the geisha special $36 (lobster,chicken, and filet) since you get the works, a drink, and the HUGE  shrimp tempura as the appetizer.  This time I got the land lovers special $33 (filet,new York strip, chicken) with shrimp tempura. Figured I would get this since I was sharing with the little one. I must say I made the right choice because I have a ton of food leftover for lunch tomorrow. This time we brought the 2 older kids and they loved it! I suppose we will be back in a couple months for one of their birthdays. :) the only downside tonight was it was extremely smokey, but totally understandable since it was super busy..all tables in use. All in all another trip we left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Great place for any occasion. Laid back and fun. Our chef was very entertaining. The food was awesome.  They also have a great happy hour that runs until 8pm."}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's day with my boyfriend and boy was it delicious! They cook everything with this pink paste that they call \"Special Sauce\" which makes everything taste amazing. We had Filet Mignon, Chicken, and Lobster. On top of the three entrees that came along with the order, each person was given 3 pieces of shrimp which tasted amazing. They had just the right amount of lemon and seasoning.  

Appetizer I Would Recommend: 
-The egg rolls! they were delicious and had the perfect amount of sauce and seasoning. The wrappers for the egg rolls were perfectly cooked, slightly crunchy and very light. 

 I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to have a fun night out with a group or even just your significant other. I will definitely be coming back here again :)"}
{"text":"Strong drinks + delicious appetizers + nice atmosphere + Groupon = a fun time for all!"}
{"text":"Meh... Hubby and I ate here and the food was not nearly as good as most of the Japanese steakhouses we have been to. The chef was friendly, but rushed and the booth was... Sticky. I felt the need to wash my hands after leaving."}
{"text":"I honestly liked Geisha before but their last service on Valentine's was horrible. I understand that servers are really busy and I should be more understanding but you can't just make us wait for 30 minutes and expect us to yell at you from the other side of the room just to remind you to refill our drinks. The menu wasn't the usual options they changed it to 4 different choices ranging from $99 to $140 per person. I wouldn't have minded the price if the food was good. It wasn't even American not Asian or Mixed! It's just some mixed sizzling plate that none of us finished. No offense but Geisha isn't particularly a 5 star restaurant anyway. If they host events please don't go."}
{"text":"On November 20, 2017 i walked in at 9:55pm and they turned me away saying that they are closed and that they dont take anybody after 10pm even though i was there 5mins early, on top of that their operating hours are until 10:30pm. This place is rudely unprofessional and the person upfront greeting their guests needs to be more polite!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi, decent prices, wonderful service, what more can you ask for?
For some unknown reason we never tried this location before, just a couple of blocks from the house, it is a shame we passed it by for so long, our loss.
We will come here more often and bring friends.
Here again , this place is so good, and so close to home I am sure we found a new to go to sushi restaurant. If I could give them mere than 5 stars  I would."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a coworker. So this place is ok, it was dark and had a funny smell we both didnt care for.  Aside from that we ordered the lunch special chicken teryaki bento box. It came out fairly quick, looked delicious and great portion size (for a lunch).  Just a heads up the teryaki chicken was extremely salty that i could not eat it but i ate everything else that it came with and it was delish. So thats why i gave them the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ok so I first discovered geisha house about ten years ago when my family had our usual birthday dinner, this one for my sister. We went to the location on desert inn, which is the original geisha. Our experience there was so wonderful, the food was full of flavor, portions were perfect, service was fun and efficient, and the price was right on for all the greatness you were receiving. So, when they opened a new location on our side of town, the northwest we were salivating with anticipation. We were visiting frequently, so much in fact that we knew the cooks by name and they knew our family. Now, here's my problem with the geisha house of NOW. We normally order the geisha special for my husband and I, which consists of a drink, soup, salad, a side (egg rolls, tempura) veggies, rice, chicken, filet mignon, and half lobster tail for 35.95. Not a bad deal, that's a lot of food! If your going to share, it's an additional ten dollars, no big deal. But here's my problem.....the portions have shrunk significantly! If your lucky you might get two small pieces of cut up lobster tail, five pieces of filet mignon and a few pieces of chicken, the majority of your plate is rice and veggies. So for 45.95 your paying for sides mostly. This is not how I remember geisha being all those years before. You would literally leave feeling full, and have some left overs for lunch the next day. Kids portions are no different, and your paying upwards of 15.00 to 17.00 depending on the type of meat they choose, this does not include a drink, so your adding an additional 2.50 for a soft drink. By the end of the night your looking at about 100-115 dollar bill without tip. Now, I love food..... I love good food and I will pay for a great meal without complaint, but I have been utterly disappointed with how much it seems they are cutting corners and shorting the customers portions for the price. I gave it 3 stars because its clean, and the service is friendly. Depending on who's cooking for you, the food can be great, and they put on a good show. As far as service goes I've only had one awful experience there and it was for lunch, so I dinged them for that as well."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night around 7:30pm. Finding the place was slightly difficult, the center they're located in took down the sign for the business. Pulling up to the restaurant, we were a little weirded out BUT, fellow yelpers had left really good reviews so we went in anyway!

The hostess and staff were very friendly. We were the only group there so we were seated immediately. 

The food was delicious! I haven't had teppan taste that good in a long time! I had ordered the shrimp meal. Their fried rice was really tasty.. they put some pink paste on all the food... it's awesome. lol. the chef kept calling it strawberry ice cream, it's good stuff. The chef was very friendly, he had mentioned that he had only been doing teppan for about 8 months.. his tricks weren't too crazy, but he sure did know how to cook :D

Anyway! -- they give you a ton of food for the price. It's delicious, I want to come back here again. I really hope more people come here, whatever happens, don't be turned down by the sketchy center it's located in! :)"}
{"text":"Yahoo!!!! Finally a Japanese restaurant that is not located on the strip and made for locals! I went to the opening of Geisha Steakhouse with my friends to see what this place is all about and we were so impressed! I will get the point on this review on why this place deserved the 5 star!

1. The decor of Geisha reminds me of a high end strip restaurant... the exotic decorations... contemporary and chic.... huge LED/LCD screens... excellent music.... okay i know i can go on but you get the point. Perfect place for a night out with the girls or on a date!!!!

2. The food and cocktails are so amazing!!! We started off by ordering the Geisha Bliss and Kiwi-licious. The Geisha Bliss is a must have because it has this coconut foam on top that blends so well with the rest of the cocktail. The Kiwi-licious is just like how it sounds... real kiwi and so ono-delicious :) 
 
For food we ordered the salmon and hamachi sushi. You can see in the pic i posted how fresh the fish tasted. We also ordered the shishito peppers, egg rolls, and beef carpaccio. 

For entrees we all tried to order different dishes so we can try a bit of everything, we ordered the scallops, braised pork belly, fresh halibut, and braised short rib. While everything was spectacular, the best dish was the braised short rib... .it tasted just like the dish from SHIBUYA @ MGM.... OMG it was so good!!!! the sauce accompanied with the puree of potatoes was fabulous! 

For dessert, we ordered the peach cobbler/pie. It was a layer of fanned out fresh peaches stacked with i think filo dough and topped with whipped cream and fresh berries (you can see in the pic). Everything was so so so good. 

3. Service was fantastic, everyone was very knowledgeable on the best dishes and cocktails. 

I live on the other side of town in Henderson, but if i could i would go there after work for a cocktail and tapas. They are running awesome specials for the locals on their tapas so if its your first time you can try a bit of everything :) For my fellow Yelpers, like their facebook page and you can see their updates on specials!!!

Good job Geisha, I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated and spacious restaurant. Delicious drinks. Good sashimi.

As for the teppanyaki, I thought it was a rather average experience. Essentially you're paying $20 for a plate of mediocre vegetable fry rice that some chef made in front of you. And what's up with the pink paste that they used to fry the rice with? It made everything pink and unpleasant looking. You're better off spending the money on something else here.

If I ever come back here, it would be for the drinks and sushi only."}
{"text":"My husband and I placed a call last night for an order for pick-up. Our bill was $91 for 2 entrees and 2 rolls (Eek!) I was thinking,\" Well, it must be good then if it's this much.\"  We gave it about 20 minutes and left to be on our way to pick it up, which then made it about 30 minutes from the time I placed the order. When I got there, the hostess said she accidentally forgot the put the order in and it was going to be about another 20 minutes or so unless she asked the cooks to please rush it. It didn't look slammed in the restaurant either, being early on a Tuesday night.  Despite my better judgement, I paid the ticket, added a more than 10% tip because I felt bad if I didn't leave anything, and went out to to tell my husband. I called back and spoke to someone else and asked if he could please pass on to tell the hostess to call my number when the food was ready. We drove around with our 2 year old for 20 minutes and finally went back inside. She went back to get the food, brought it out like nothing had happened. I asked if the food had been sitting long (since I didn't get a phone call saying it was ready when she knew we would be driving around), and she said, \"Nope it wasn't waiting long, it's still hot.\" Well how long had it been ready for? The food is good, but I think it was WAY overpriced to pay $100 for that. We should have cancelled the order and went somewhere else. If the order would have been forgotten when dining in, we would have had some sort of apology from the manager or something comped as kind gesture for their Fk-up. Apparently when it happens when you place an order to-go, it doesn't apply. I don't think we will come here again, which is a shame. The inside was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Great hibachi! Expensive, of course, but very good! I got steak and they give you a few shrimp, so that's straight. The sauces were delish; especially the whitish one (haha I wish I knew what was in it, it's awesome). They put on a show, the whole she-bang. It was a birthday dinner with a bunch of friends so good times. The salad could have been better, but all in all, it was alot of food and very tasty. :D"}
{"text":"Great sushi! They have a sushi happy hour from 5-7. Pitchers of Sapporo beer. All kinds of beautiful rolls of every kind: tempura, fresh, deep fried, etc"}
{"text":"Its home of delicious food! We were party of 7 for a bday celebration and weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Located at a strip mall, this location has limited parking. The food is great - I always get their special: shrimp tempura appetizer, fried rice, shrimps, lobster, filet mignon and chicken. The filet is always tender, juicy and full of flavor. I've tried their sushi and they're great as well. No matter what I get, I always have plenty of leftovers - not because the food isn't good but there's too much food.

Sit around the hibachi grill for a great show. It's just like the \"B\" hibachi place. I like how they make onion volcano - I feel like a kid again.

The only thing I don't like about this place is how obnoxious, embarrassing and loud it gets when somebody's celebrating his/her birthday. We're talking disco lights, megaphones, real loud and weird version of \"Happy Birthday\". I feel bad for the servers and the person who has a birthday.  I've told my family not to take me here on my birthday...EVERRR!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for close to 15 yrs... It is my wife and I favorite dinner spot for over a decade for a good reason... The food and service are second to none!! We have had many Chefs there who were all very good, but something about Edwards performance lastnight made me want to single him out in this review!! He was awesome!! I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a fantastic meal consistently and is tired of looking!! Your search is over!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Eastside location for over 15 yrs now... After moving to the Northwest and trying this location, I am sold... Rico was our server tonight and he was awesome!! I highly recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"A NITE TO REMEMBER! This was our 2nd time eating at Geisha House, my 1st experience was terrible! But I will say this one was much better.

We showed up 12 people deep to celebrated my friends b day, overall we had a great nite. I was a little nervous from my previous experience eating food as it hit my plate but I'd say lesson learned, I was patient with my food tasting this time, waiting for all my food to come and just nibbling it worked out much better. 

if your not familiar with Geisha House we sat at the hibachi table where the food is cooked in front of a rounded bar style seating it's really intense.

Our cook Om was very good and Chuck the server did a really great job dealing with me and my outspoken spontaneous wife and friends. As he is repeating orders out loud my wife lets him know not to yell out her order, respectfully he leans in and whispers her order to her directly now that's what I call customer service!

I ordered a combination dinner of filet mignon and chicken that came with hibachi rice and vegetables I also had an order of sake. My patience payed off, once all my food was delivered I enjoyed every bite!

I wanted to give this a 4 star review because of the pricing but I realized the level of customer service and the awesome experience we had they deserve 5. Other than the price of the food we had a great time and I actually will remember this for some time good job GH."}
{"text":"My friend purchased the Groupon and we ate there for dinner one night. Afterwards, I really wished I had purchased the Groupon too so we could have gone again! We were seated at a table with another couple, we were able to chat with them a little bit but it wasn't disruptive at all when we wanted to have our own conversation. The hostess was friendly and the service was great, they really put on a fun show."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi, very reasonable pricing & OUTSTANDING service. 

We sat at the sushi bar & just wanted to grab a bite- because we were on the go. The gentleman who sat us was extremely outgoing & very welcoming (unlike a majority of the other sushi joints we regular). On top of that, the sushi chef who served us was possibly the sweetest man to ever work behind a sushi bar. Not only was he friendly, but he made us a special snack on the house. 

We will definitely return for teppanyaki & $5 lemon drop martinis!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my husband's birthday. Great food and good service. It was a little pricey compared to other teppan places that I have gone to in the past. 
Our cook was very friendly and accommodating. Also we had a waitress as well that was really on top of her game. She was always there asking if anything was needed. They were very prompt with clearing of dishes as well."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but it was extremely pricey! We've eaten at a lot of hibachi grills and this was the most expensive one we have ever been too. The food wasn't much different than any of the others either."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet you have to try the Shushi!! The Shushi chef is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"ASK FOR CHEF EDDIE! I promise you won't regret it. He takes care of his customers and gives you a show. He's awesome. Food is always delicious and well seasoned with flavor. Portions are awesome and you always are full from the soup to the salad, down to your entree. They take care of you for the price. Definitely a good meal and a great place for date night."}
{"text":"**Naked Sushi Event**
       - Price - It was $46 + $5 mandatory tip. They gave you one drink coupon that was good for only bottled water or domestic beer.
       - Food - What I listed in the food section is all the food they offer. I didn't miss anything. The selection is THAT limited.
       - Buffet Style - The food is laid out buffet style around a hibachi chef and sushi model.
       - Drinks - You didn't get waiter service for drinks. You have to go to the bar to get drinks and they don't offer plain water (it had to be bottled). What kind of place doesn't offer water? Even clubs offer water!
       - Groupon - I paid $23 since I had a groupon and I still think I got ripped off.
       - Models - They had two rotating models in panties, pasties, and banana leaves on them. The highlight of the night was watching guys try to hit on them or try to get the pieces of sushi on their bodies. No, the sushi on the models was just for show and you couldn't grab them if anyone was wondering.
       - Health Code Violations - With the exception of the fried rice, all the hot foods were cold. Some of the hot foods were on heating trays and some weren't. However, none of the fires under the trays were on.
       - Live Music - They had a DJ playing songs the whole night.
       - Rip Off - From their mandatory tip (for no service), to their disallowance of getting water, to their limited selection of food, to their overload of fried rice and nigiri rice, to the pathetic selection of sushi rolls, I get a sense that they're really blatantly and unabashedly trying to rip off their customers.
**Food**
       - Fried Rice - Pretty much just fried rice with a couple specs of overcooked chicken hidden in. They fill half your plate with rice hoping to fill you up.
       - Tempura - They had shrimp and vegetable tempura. It was cold and over battered.
       - Egg Rolls/Gyoza - I'd say it's comparable to $5 buffets in downtown.
       - Chicken Skewers - They were overcooked, dry, and way below room temperature. I believe that's a health code violation.
       - Sushi - The first time we went around they had california rolls, spicy tuna rolls, some kind of shrimp tempura roll, and a plate of nigiri. The second time we went around, it was 70% california rolls/spicy tuna rolls and a couple shrimp tempura rolls. I guess nigiri was costing them too much.
       - Rice - The couple nigiri I grabbed the first time had way too much rice in it.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't recommend this place if I had a gun to my head. I mean, not getting waiter service for drinks?  What was the mandatory tip for? Serving over salted foods and not allowing water? Is that even legal?"}
{"text":"Love this place! We always try to sit with Chris, he is a phenomenal sushi chef and always remembers little things about how his patrons like their food.  The pricing is fair for the size of the portions and we've yet to have a bad experience here.  We eat here twice a month and always look forward to it. Tends to be very busy on Friday/Saturday nights but we've never had to wait very long."}
{"text":"I love the food and drinks here it's just kinda pricy but the service is good and you won't be disappointed!! We mainly just love the appetizers and alcoholic drinks"}
{"text":"I have to admit that the food I was served was actually pretty good. The problem here was the service, or shall I say lack of. 

I went to this place with a group of 8 (which included 3 kids) and it seemed although we made a reservation they clearly had no idea how to handle us. We arrived a few minutes before our scheduled reservation and were placed at a table by ourselves, with no drinks or anything, other than an apology that they were really busy. DUH! It was a Saturday night, and isn't that the reason people make reservations??? The restaurant was packed and it seemed that the staff were quite overwhelmed. We finally were escorted to our table (that we would eat at) about 30 minutes after arriving. One of the men in our group had decided to get us drinks at the bar, which helped ease the frustration. We ordered off the table menu as well as 4 rolls from the sushi bar. The cook was very entertaining, mixing it up with the kids and displaying his skills. The meal was very good, but after the final entree was served, I managed to flag down our waitress to ask about the sushi rolls. It turns out she had forgotten to turn in the order, and we were told it would take another 30 minutes to get to ours if she turned it in at that point. Of course we opted to nix the sushi rolls, but what a disappointment!!!! (I love sushi) 

I really wanted this place to wow me, because it's soooo close to my house. I might return again with fewer people, and maybe on a weekday to avoid the long wait time (even with a reservation.)"}

The following review is NOT based on the locale, or how the restaurant is situated, seating arrangement or the conditions of the restrooms.
This review is a reflection of our latest EXPERIENCE ONLY.  
...

The wifey & I met my niece here for an early dinner.
We were greeted heartily by the host who had his Cheshire grin on...a bit creepy, yes, but seemed genuine to make our stay pleasant. I told him that we were meeting a 3rd member of our party and that she was sitting at the bar. He showed us to the bar, had the bartender take our order while he had a staff member prepare our teppanyaki area.
Once seated around our grill, our drink order was taken almost immediately & served up quite quickly.
Shortly thereafter, our waiter was asking for our food order & all of a sudden I felt rushed.
Twice, we had to tell the guy who was taking our order, that we'll need a few moments...
My niece only wanted a couple of rolls, \"The Hawaiian\" & the \"Sexy Back\" & a couple orders of sushi. Our order taker tried to push the \"Ex Girlfriend\" & the \"What The Heck\" rolls, but my niece knew exactly what she wanted & those suggested rolls weren't it.
The wife ordered the Chicken & I asked for the NY Steak (medium).
Our Teppanyaki Chef came out & introduced himself as King.
He was damn good as most teppanyaki chefs are...all with the same flare tricks; the drumming of the grill with fork & spatula, flipping the salt shaker into hat, the juggling of the rice bowls...you get the picture. We've seen it all before, but always feel the need to \"ooh & ahhh\" & of course, clap.
[Does anyone feel a bit bewildered that Asian grill chefs are getting harder & harder find nowadays?]
Seeing that my niece was only having sushi, King asked if we'd like to just go ahead and split the 2 dinners 3-ways...I said \"SURE! That'd be great!\" All was shared including the rolls & sushi...
We hadn't seen our niece in quite some time so there was a lot of catching up to do, all the while the busboys were trying to grab our unfinished plates & platters... \"uhmmm, I'm still working on this...\" ,  \"there's still some rolls on that\". I felt annoyed once again. Sorry I wasn't eating fast enough for you, guy!
King cleaned the grilled & excused himself & we thanked him for a job well done.
Finally, the food was cleared off our plates & taken away by the anxious bussing staff.
All the food was delicious & the steak cooked to perfection. It was the PERFECT amount of food for the 3 of us to have split like that...
I asked for the check & our host asked how our experience was & we all agreed that it was good. He tried pushing the dessert but we had to kindly reject as we'd made previous plans to hit up the local smoothie joint.
The check was left & did a double-take on the total. Suddenly I'm interested at why it seemed high for just the 3 of us. Spying the itemized bill, THEY actually charge for SHARING! Uhmmm, my niece ordered a couple rolls & sushi totaling the cost of my steak dinner! WTF is up with this \"sharing\" charge?
I didn't bother bringing it up to the wifey cuz she probably would've made me make a scene or caused one herself...I paid the check with a smile vowing to warn my fellow YELPers.
After telling this part of the experience to a friend & fellow YELPer, he said that they ALSO secretly charge for SPLIT checks! WTH?
So, be forewarned, check the check for secret charges. Ask to NOT have the dinner \"sharing\" charge added if that person is ALREADY having what is equal to the total of a regular teppanyaki grill dinner.

Deductions:
1/2 STAR - for the hurried act of wanting/needing to take our order quickly.
1/2 STAR - for trying to pull our unfinished plates while still chewing.
1/2 STAR - for the \"secret\" charges.

May your palate always be surprised by goodness & your glass never be empty!

Another deez® review, because you deserve it."}
{"text":"So I came here the other day and omg this place is so damn good ! So worth the money !! Nice dinner date, would absolutely come here again !"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid for special occasions. After been away from years, I finally came back to celebrate my Dad's birthday. You need a reservation, especially with 8 of us. We arrived right on time, but since half of our party wasn't there, they wouldn't sit us, which was really annoying since their waiting area is ridiculously uncomfortable. A few cushions wouldn't hurt!
Anyway, once we were seated the amazing service that I'm used to shined through. We all ordered and after about 10 minutes, our awesome chef was out to cook our food and give us a good show. As usual, the portions were big and the food was delish. We ordered at least one of each entree and the dinner for two special is a deal. The shrimp was amazing, the lobster was alright and on the small side, the steaks (new york and filet) we cooked perfectly, and the scallops were killer. 
Overall this place is still as good as it was 15 years ago and the prices are still really great for what you get. Plus you can buy their secret sauce and salad dressing to take home with you. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Terrible fried rice, after that nothing matters. Service is okay. Steak was a bit overdone."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful dinner! The entire experience is so fun. Will was our cook and he was just amazing. He had a wonderful personality and he really put on a show for us. We got the geisha special and it was amazing. The salad dressing is delicious, as was the sauce that came with the egg rolls. The Big Mac sauce with the entrees was my favorite of the three that they give you. I would have liked more than two pieces of shrimp with my meal, but there is enough meat to compensate for that. I would definitely recommend this location to everyone!"}
{"text":"I live close by. I love eating here. Service is impeccable and the ambiance is wonderful. My sweet lady and I love to dine here at least once a month. It's our special place. My names Mic Tre and I approved this message."}
{"text":"We had a teppanyaki dinner for 4 here tonight and walked away very happy! Good service, good presentation, friendly staff and great food. You get the usual egg roll, volcano and the choo choo train but that's part of the fun and we all had a good laugh along with our chef.

We didn't try any sushi and missed out on the naked girls but we had a great experience and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars for Geisha Steakhouse. Good waiter service and our chef was pretty darn good. Very friendly, did a good job entertaining us, and overall tried to make our experience fun, especially the kids.

I really disliked the size of the meat portions, for the \"land lover special\", and thought they were way too small for $38. The chicken was too thin, overcooked and a bit tough and the NY steak was good, but nothing too terribly special. However, the filet was outstanding in terms of tenderness, quality and seasoning.

The mushroom soup was very, very good. The salad was bland and pretty much sucked. The tempura battered veggies and shrimp were good but pretty standard. Batter and hot oil, not too hard to get it right.

The fried rice had too much seasoning and their \"pink special sauce\" which gave it a bit of an oily, overpowering flavor. The amount of vegetables was a lot less than I'm accustomed to at a Japanese steakhouse and they should really step it up to help balance out their lack of protein portions.

All in all we thought it was pretty good but there's definitely room for some improvement."}
{"text":"Pretty good for night out with girls. Saturday night it turns into a club with no cover charge. I didn't like my lychee martini but I traded with my friend for the ginger cocktail. Yellowtail roll, and Geisha roll were goid. Would have liked a cheaper bento option for dinner"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, slow crowd, but service was still slow.  Ordered off lunch special & had side salad instead of miso.  Salad is great.  Lunch special was ok.  Dinner time seems to be a better preparation.  Music playing was great and full bar was open."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick meal a couple weeks ago and had a sashimi salad. Well proportioned, this was by far one of the best sashimi salads I've had to date. The service was great and everyone was very nice and attentive. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"It's New Years day, friends are in town and we need a place to eat, has to be Geisha house, but wait a minute, the eastside is closed ! WTF, seriously, noooooooo

At this point the group wants teppanyaki, one of the group comes up with Benihana ! Seriously, I had to drag her away to have a quiet chat about good food, silly lady.

Anyways, a quick phone call later and we find that the location in the southwest is open, so a 20 minute drive.

Same menu, nice decor, let's eat.

Well there are some differences, this location seems to use more teriyaki and less secret sauce, mmm not so good...Service was ok, but we are used to the eastside location where in fairness we are known so are drinks come to the table without having to order. However, plates were left on the tables for a while before the busperson got around to collecting them. But drinks were refilled quickly, so ok, they get a pass.

The food, well yes it had more teriyaki than normal, but the Geisha House taste was still there, so it was good, I will say, with 7 of us around the table there wasn't the normal flow to the food coming on to the plate, this is to be expected, but again, the eastside manages to get the food on the plate quickly.

So food is good, service was ok, a couple of small things I really liked.

My wife asked about the knife the chef was using, he gave us probably a 10 minute lecture (I use that phrase in a good way) about the different types of knives to use for cooking and how the knife he uses for the grill is actually pretty cheap (because he goes through them quickly due to metal on metal) but he keeps is razor sharp and he even gave my wife some ideas on new kitchen knives for her. Of course it was only after getting home that I found out how much a Bob Kramer knife costs lol

Also the manager was a lot of fun, he checked on us a couple of times during the meal and even comped us desert and a round of drinks to welcome in the new year, love it.

One little feature that I will be trying, they have grills out on the patio, once the weather warms up we will have to give that a try.

So all in all a good meal."}
{"text":"Geisha House, how much do I love this place ?

Well I have been eating here for 21 years, through 3 owners and who knows how many chefs.

The food is as good today as it was 21 years ago. Yes it is a little hard to find, but oh so worth it.

The food is delicious, the chefs are fun, the service is good oh and the food is delicious...Yeah it is that good."}
{"text":"The steak and shrimp was good. They put on a nice show when they are cooking the food right in front of tou. The service was ok, friendly is a good word. However bones in my unagi roll is unforgivable. After I swallowed a bones I pulled out four long skinny pointy fish bones. They offered to make me another. I declined and they removed the sushi from my bill. 

Sorry bout it."}
{"text":"Again 5 stars, Michael at the bar was attentive assuring our food and drinks were full.  Great food, great service and a great place.  Don't miss this new gem at their new location.  Can't wait till next week will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Do you want your food cooked right in front of you? Do you want some entertainment as it's being done? Then go down to Geisha House Steak & Sushi!

This place is perfect for any celebration or even business meals. They have grill that has seats around it and then the chef comes up and cooks in front of you. Our chef provided plenty of neat tricks and was friendly with everyone. He did everyone in our party food just how they liked it. 
I ordered the geisha special which came with an appetizer (I chose shrimp tempura), drink(I had soda), soup and salad, hibachi shrimp, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, bean sprouts, fried rice, and filet mignon, chicken, and lobster. Everything was good. They even give you a plate with 3 sauces and recommend what sauce goes with what. I tried the sauces on different things but found what they recommend is right haha. One sauce was sweet, one was spicy, and the other was more salty. The filet mignon was sooo tender and the lobster was juicy. Chicken was cooked through which is what you want with chicken.

I give geisha house 4 stars and I plan on returning to try their sushi and other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I love Geisha. It was my Bday and they gave me Free Green tea Ice cream. Surprisingly it was really good. 

It was good. The Pink rice is delish. Its a good flavor. Not superb but good. I had lobster and it was not that tastey. No seasoning. But it was still good. The cook was really nice and he did bring me the ice cream. Lol. Its a really good amount of food too. 

Four stars only because I havent been here enough times to really know. Also, the Host was in kind of a mood when we walked in and he definitely forced the tips a little."}
{"text":"We went here after a language class and we were all in the mood for fun. There was a sake tasting event going on (we caught the tail end of that but hey, free sake!) and the place was pretty busy. 

Ambiance is nice, the layout is logical with a big bar and separate section for dining and hibachi. The manager there was happy to see our group and sent over a bottle of sake to enjoy. Was awesome!

I had eaten a rather large lunch so I wasn't hungry when I got there but after a few sakes I was ready for some tapas.  They didn't disappoint! Price was reasonable and the quality was good. Not crazy good but very good. I ordered stuffed mushrooms, the yakitori, the pork belly skewers, and the egg rolls. All very well done and tasty! Each only about $7 (regular price menu) because we had missed the happy hour. (Happy hour is from 4PM-9PM)

I will definitely go back another time and try to catch the happy hour. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. Such a fun place to eat! Customer service is always personal and tentative.  The sushi is fresh and delicious but the grill is fabulous."}
{"text":"Most recent visit was as good as the rest.  Family all ordered the usual, and the scallops were cooked perfectly this time around after the minor hiccup last time.  

Also, the place was packed.  With the economy improving and their friendlier prices, I'd recommend a reservation to be safe-- especially on the weekend if you're looking to do the hibachi."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing customer service! Me and my fiancé will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This was a spur of the moment choice for dinner Saturday night..they were kinda busy so the sat us at the bar..Bartender super cute personality and suggested the blue raspberry sake which was pretty good..We waited maybe 10 minutes before being seated..Decided to split the special which was soup/salad/appetizer/entree (shrimp, lobster, filet mignon, and chicken) OMG it was AMAZING!! The salad was really good w/the ginger dressing..tempura veggies were greatness..the entree (because my date is allergic to seafood, I got the lobster and shrimp) And it was beyond delicious..The chicken and steak were pretty good for the bite that I received lol..All and all a great experience!"}
{"text":"Being that this joint is 5 min from my house, makes it hard to choose another restaurant to satisfy my hibachi cravings. Their staff is incredible and the food, phenomenal. You'll fall in love with their pink fried rice! & if hibachi isn't your style, there's seating at tables for you to enjoy some sushi or kitchen made entrees. It's always a good time when I go here!"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to enjoy the hibachi side of the house. Our waitress was very impatient and I was all around surprised about her rudeness this visit. The grill master was entertaining and the food delicious. Still the best we have visited so far."}
{"text":"Limited Sushi menu, price point on the hibachi is high for the portion size you get, and the katsu was fatty and rubbery.  We were the only ones there yet the waitress was slow to respond to our requests."}
{"text":"So it was Friday night and I wanted to have a couple of beers at a bar but didn't feel like bar food...so I though a sushi bar would be a good idea.  I thought I would try this place - it was close. 

The place is nice inside - service was efficient - not friendly though.   

I order a beer and a spicy tuna handroll to start.  I am used to a cone shaped hand roll, but this was tube shaped and the size of an almond joy???  It was okay not great.

Then I ordered a cut roll.  I was watching him make it and something wasn't right, but i couldn't put my thumb on it.  It was okay - but I wasn't even close to being full or even satisified.

I order another roll off the menu.  Still - wan't quite sure what the prob was.  Again - it was okay.  After a hand roll and 2 cut rolls I was still starving - but geez I am on a budget.

Anyway - I realized they use small pieces of nori and therefor you end up with a smaller sushi roll.  The rolls were substantially smaller  than a typical roll!!!  I am not a glutton by any means but I expect a sushi roll to be a ...---\"sushi roll!\"  I wasn't ordering off the kids menu here.  

The bill was $40; 1 hand roll, 2 tiny rolls, 1 beer.  Usually 2 rolls will do the trick for me.  After 3 mini rolls I left unsatisfied and feeling duped.  In this economy people are looking for value - not skimpy mini rolls!

ATTN: Giesha House - Your tiny sushi rolls do not cut it - I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant for locals!!!

Atmosphere:  I was greeted by friendly hostesses that were dressed in authentic geisha kimonos. Cool, trendy, sleek decor with great music. I came here with my boyfriend and dined inside the restaurant, but they have a beautiful patio setting that I will definetly take advantage of the next time I visit. This is the perfect place to bring a date to, or even for a classy dinner for the family. 

Food: The sushi was immaculate. The fish was extremely fresh and vibrant. Their ponzu sauce is delicious! It's been a long time since I've had the privilege to taste this quality of sushi. With the entire town flooded with ayce sushi restaurants, it's been nearly impossible for me to find a sushi restaurant that prefers quality over quantity. My boyfriend tried the braised short ribs which he described as melt in your mouth delicious. The Serrano hamachi dish was very inventive. This is usually one of my favorite dishes, but I've never seen it made with yuzu foam which made it outshine all the other places I've tried it at. We also had the lamb pops for an appetizer, and we had to order an extra order because my boyfriend loved it so much. All the dishes were tantalizing to the taste buds.

Service: Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and patient with our questions, and trust me we had a lot of them to answer. I don't know much about sake, but I wanted to try something new. The server gave me a quick 101 on the different sakes available which made it much easier for me to decide from. The managers came by and checked on us to make sure we had a good experience, which was really nice to see that everyone was eager to serve us well. Most of the things we ordered were recommendations from the server, and I'm glad she was so informative about the dishes. She also served us ginger coffee chocolates at the end of our meal that was complimentary. A perfect ending to a perfect meal.

Price: With the decor and presentation of the food, I would imagine the dishes would be quite pricey. However, that was not the case at all. Extremely affordable prices that I would actually pay double for, but I was glad to be able to enjoy everything for such a great price. 

Great job GEISHA HOUSE! I will be a returning customer for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is good sometimes, it's inconsistent. I guess it depends on who's in the kitchen when you go there. I always order the pork katsu bento box or the salmon teriyaki one. The servers always make you wait before getting your order. I would have given them 5 stars if it weren't for the not that nice customer service from the staff. Anyway, the food is satisfactory today so, all in all I guess this visit is good enough for a 4 stars review."}
{"text":"Always enjoy a good Japanese meal, this place can get pretty busy but they do their best to get you in timely and are friendly.  Tonight I dine alone and they are busy so they set me at the sushi bar where I can watch the artist at work, I love watching them make all the rolls I just don't like fish.
My drink and meal were both great and fast.  I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Find a better Japanese Steakhouse. This was my wife's and I first one in Vegas we have tried. 

We almost turned around at the door when we saw $22 for Shimp dinner and $24 for a Steak Dinner. The dinners were the same price whether you had the cook do it in front of you or not. 

And what is this Red Special Sauce???? Watermelon Sauce, as the first reviewer stated? Don't know what it is and could not taste anything. It was just weird to see red rice. It was almost waxy. Soup warm just warm not hot at all. All the food seemed like is was drenched in oil. 

Not great entertainment either. 

Service. I sat with soup, and salad bowls on a sushi plate empty waiting to be picked up while i was being served rice from the cook. 

Good Luck if you go here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! 1 star for atmosphere, 1 for hostesses and managers. My two girlfriends and I ate here last night in hopes of hitting happy hour. We arrived around 6:15 with enough time to order a couple drinks and order a couple different items from the happy hour menu before it ended at 6:30. As soon as we sat down, I asked the bartender if we needed to put in our order right away since happy hour was ending in 15 min. He made a sarcastic joke about \"gotta put it in now!\" and then walked away to get our drinks. The bartender brought our glasses of wine rather quickly but never took our food order! By the time he lapped around the empty bar, we tried to order and he informed us it was now after 6:30 and we would not get the happy hour prices because the chefs watch the time and they won't honor it. This immediately put me in a sour mood because we had been waiting to place our order for 10 min! Since we now had to pay full price for our food, we asked the nice hostess to seat us at a table. The atmosphere is really nice! Our table was nice and spacious for a 4 top and it was neat watching the hibachi tables. However, our server was TERRIBLE! He walked by multiple time and took forever to greet us. When he finally did greet us, we asked multiple times for an extra paper order sheet to place additional orders, (which we never got), he spoke so low we couldn't understand him, and seemed very unsure about how to take an order. We ordered a variety of food: gyoza (good but I've had better at other sushi joints), the Hawaiian roll, Love roll, and Secret from my Husband. The sushi was nothing to write home about so we decided to try something completely different. We ordered the jalapeno cracker, and it was not good! Tasted like a grilled tuna fish sandwich with jalapenos! Our server never asked if we wanted another glass of wine, while our glasses sat empty, but was quick to fill our waters and clear our plates. He never offered dessert, which we would have ordered because we were still hungry, and took another 20 minutes to finally bring the check. Thank god we had a groupon because I would have been really upset to have paid full price. Having worked in the service industry for over 15 years, I understand the hardships of opening a new restaurant. However, making sure your staff is fully prepared is key. Sadly, 3 customers were lost in this awful experience. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the original Geisha Steakhouse which has been around for a loooooonnnggg time believe me. I had one of my first dates with my husband here back in the late 80's and we have introduced many people to this restaurant including our daughter, Mom and Dad, hubby's Dad, other family members and a ton of friends.  All is can say is the food is consistently delicious every time we come. Since we no longer live on this side of town, we only come now for special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries etc. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy especially at night but I would only patronize this location. 

Last night was no exception to the incredible food found here. There were five of us last night and we all ordered the Geisha Special which consists of filet mignon (cooked exactly how you like it), lobster, shrimp and chicken. Each dinner comes with a bowl of miso soup, a salad, your choice of appetizer of either Shrimp tempura, shrimp and vegetable tempura or an egg roll. Then you have fried rice and vegetables as well. The dinner also includes your choice of soda or hot sake. In the old days, the dinner used to include dessert too of which I always chose the green tea ice cream. I sure do miss it! Once the orders are in, out comes the chef to cook up your meal on the teppanyaki grill. We have had some really funny chefs through the years that have provided us with a ton of entertainment. Our favorite will always be Chef Jimmy - RIP. He was the original owner of this restaurant and he always cooked our food to perfection and left us laughing our asses off.

Once the cooking begins there is fire and heat and the smells coming from the food are mouth watering, you literally can't wait for your food to be delivered to your plate. The lobster was just so fresh and light. Dipping into a delicious ginger sauce just set all the flavors into an explosion in your mouth. The filet mignon was juicy and dipped into the hot mustard sauce made it even better. The chicken is always good and when the fried rice comes off the grill I just want to dive into it. 

The customer service is outstanding and our server was always offering us more drinks, filling our water glasses and removing empty plates from the small eating area. The restaurant is not that big so I recommend always making a reservation just in case especially on the weekends.

Long live Geisha Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Debbie is super friendly and great customer service !!! Ricky is our cook and he is super funny ! I enjoyed our dinner today :))"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for longer than I can remember and I love love love it! Did I mention I love Geisha's?! 

Some people may think it's cheesy to sit at a grill and watch a chef preform tricks and crack silly puns while preparing your food, but I get the biggest kick out of it! The best is bringing people here who have never experienced teppanyaki/hibachi. 

Some people say \"well how about Benihana's???\", well I say pffffff.... that place is for tourists!  :)
 My main reason for raving that Geisha's is better is that they this secret sauce when they are cooking on the grill.. It's like a pink butter (we call it watermelon butter) It's delicious and tastes so much better than that other place. 

I get the Geisha special every time. Filet, Chicken & lobster, it also comes with shrimp, fried rice, veggies, miso soup, salad & Saki. It's all a good deal and what's even better is I can never finish it and It makes for a great leftovers. 

If you don't want to gorge yourself on teppanyaki then they do offer a sushi bar as well. I've read on YELP it's pretty amazing.

This will always be one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.
 
We've done Geisha's for New Years, Birthday's, casual dinners, and have used it for an excuse to drink way too much saki! 

Now that I think about, I want to have my 35th B-day party at Geisha's this summer! Everyone's invited!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. Geisha ROCKS!!!! Eddie is a great chef and is very good at what he does and is very friendly. The staff are always on top of drinks and whatever you need. 5 star worthy!!"}
{"text":"Gr8 Japanese restaurant.  5 star service and food.  Fresh sushi, gourmet hibachi meats and fantastic table service w/nice presentations of meal courses.  Ambience and spaciousness make this an ideal place to dine and relax w/friends, family or business colleagues.  Portions are generous and specials are good deals."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night. Table cooking. Ordered the Geisha Special: Filet, Scallops & Lobster plus a couple sautéed shrimp to top it off. Turned out very good. You get the standard soup, salad then appetizer choice of either egg rolls or shrimp & vegetable tempura then they start the table cooking.  Tons of food, you won't starve.  Always entertaining and deserving of a good tip. It was very clean everywhere we could see, at least, and even the restrooms were very clean.  There was a 'A' grade posted with a valid date.  All the normal things you notice, at least. The staff was well trained, attentive and personable. Was a nice dinner. The only thing missing was that they were out of green tea ice cream. I didn't need it anyway though. :)"}
{"text":"Got a groupon for $15 for $30 during happy hour. What a great deal! Delicious food, friendly service, beautiful interior. Happy hour everyday from 4-9!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Especially during conventions.
The food is awesome and the service is fabulous. No wonder that they were able to stay in business since 1991. Everything I have had has been delicious."}
{"text":"I really liked the interior of the restaurant, but the food I would say was not the best I have had. I had the tepanyaki menu (grill). I thought the portions were simply way too much for one person to finish. I could barely finish half of the rice, and I had a ton of leftover seafood and meat as well. Perhaps it might be a good idea for them to lower the price a little and adjust the portions to something more realistic. 
Since the portions are huge, the price isn't that friendly either. Don't get me wrong though, for how much they give you the price is good. However, it isn't that easy to order only 1 portion for 2 people for tepanyaki. 
The server was nice but a little awkward I felt like. For instance, we had beer and cocktail from the bar and we had to switched tables since we were getting tepanyaki. The server came to us to direct us to our tables. I thought she would either help us bring the drinks, or let us know that she will bring it for us later. Instead, we had to awkwardly carry the drinks ourselves (and we had 2 for each person) carefully across the restaurant. Only when we got to the new table did she recognize how carefully we were carrying the cups and asked us if we needed help. 

Overall, not a bad restaurant, but not a restaurant to be excited for really."}
{"text":"Gem of a place. What a pleasure to find a restaurant with service minded staff. Friendly and welcoming is the way you'll feel when you show up. The Menu is standard flare from an Hitachi style restaurant with a variety that will satisfy many. The dinner is prepared with mouth watering seasonings, in a fun manner. The I had the New York steak and a side of scallops and was very satisfied. This is truly a diamond in the rough as too the location."}
{"text":"This spot was a regular hangout for me when it was under different ownership (different name too) First time here as Geisha House. I work out at LVAC so I've been wanting to stop by forever. I was not disappointed. The tuna and salmon were fresh....the service is very good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5 star rating would be more appropriate. Came in on a groupon with a friend.

While it was nice and all, having every single one of my items red/pink-colored bothered me. He used red butter on absolutely everything. Our chef was really nice, though. It was cute to have him throw in the random humor and tricks of the trade.

Food was decent, ALL red-colored, but nothing special. It doesn't stand out as a hibachi place I'll be coming back to anytime soon.

Service was decent so no complaints there. But nothing special either."}
{"text":"We came here for our friend's birthday on a random Sunday night. There was only 1 or 2 other tables, but our party took up 3 tables. I really liked the set up of the restaurant, the booths were super big which worked out well for us because we had our very busy 19 month old with us. She had plenty of room to move around and we had space to put our giant diaper bag and all of our stuff. 

The service was a bit slow. I understand that we were a large party but there was one waiter for the entire restaurant and he was definitely taxed with all of the tables. Luckily, there were 2 chefs working the grills but it still took a bit for them to come to our table. Our chef was funny and personable and we enjoyed the show. I personally wasn't a fan of the \"pink sauce\" that they put in everything. I also would have liked a few more vegetables in the fried rice, it was basically just rice and onions. Everything was cooked well, but everything was cooked in the pink sauce. 

We had a fun dinner, but it wasn't as tasty as I had hoped."}
{"text":"The service was great and all my expectation were succeeded! Our chef that prepared our food right in front of us named John was so enthusiastic and full of joy! Geisha Steakhouse is very accommodating. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful time dining at the Geisha Steakhouse.  I took a friend to dinner for his birthday.   It's hard to choose what things to talk about because everything was so awesome.  I tried a specialty drink, the Lychee Martini.  Not only was it beautifully presented with a piece of fresh fruit and lovely flower, it tasted amazing.   I had to order another.  
Of course, I go mainly for the food.  I have never had a bad experience with their food.  Our chef during this visit was the most captivating chef yet.  He went by the name of Stan Lee.   My party was comprised of the geeky type, so we will never forget his name.  I loved his engagement with the parties at his table.  It seemed like he caters to the type of crowd he prepares his masterpiece for.  He even ended his spectacular performance with a fire dance.  
Thank you for such a wonderful experience,  we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My son turned 14 today and chose to come here for his celebration.  I always allow him to chose who he wants to bring. I made sure to make reservations since it would be a large party.  This is the first time no have come here and had some disappointment.  My reservation was at 6pm.  It took awhile to have our drink orders taken and even longer to get the drinks.  They ran out of co2 and had to send someone for more.  Our food order was not taken until 6:30.  We were offered a table extension,  but when it finally came, the guy put it at the empty table and left, so we moved it ourselves.  
The food was a redeeming factor.  The chef was pleasant and handled our party of 10 well.  He made my children laugh and the birthday boy enjoyed a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I tried this Sushi place only because I bought a Groupon for it. I would not have tried it otherwise, but boy am I glad I did!!! This is hands down my FAVORITE Sushi place in Las Vegas. The ingredients were so fresh and far more tastier than anywhere else. They DO NOT overstuff their rolls with rice like most shopping mall sushi places. You get all the fresh and tasty sushi roll ingredients. The Sushi chef was very entertaining and very personable, and also made us custom rolls based on what we liked.

The manager stopped by twice to ask how our dining experience was, our drinks were NEVER empty and even the table bussers and waitresses offered top notch service making sure we were happy and taken care of. 

On top of that they show the UFC! Can't wait to watch the next UFC and eat at my new favorite sushi place. Even though it is quite a drive for me, I would definitely make it over and over again as it is very much worth it. See you at the sushi bar next UFC!"}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour 4pm-9pm. Had a Japanese Lasagna sushi roll $7 and a 3 piece sampler $5. Just looking at the sushi menu, it seems a little spendy. I get Japanese lasagna everywhere I go and this one was just OK. 
The restaurant is very nice, with about 5 teppanyaki tables inside and 2 out on the patio which is pretty cool. I've always thought Geisha Steak house had the best teppanyaki meal in Vegas, I just haven't had one for awhile. 
Drinks here were just OK as well, nothing exciting to rave about. Had a strawberry martini and a sake/ginger mojito. I'd come here for the cool ambiance again. Service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to find an amazing filet!! Nothing else and nowhere else compares! I don't like fish but my husband loves coming here for the sushi. The staff is great and are always nice and helpful. I never leave unhappy!"}
{"text":"My purpose for lowering the overall rating I gave Geisha House is due to the continued lack of customer service. The ambiance may be higher quality than most restaurants in this particular area, but we as the customers should not patron a business that continually disregards its regular customers.

At the time of writing this review, I have dined here a minimum of 14 times, and is more likely to be in the neighborhood of 24 plus times. 

I will no longer be dining at this establishment."}
{"text":"While I'm not exactly sure what a Geisha house is supposed to look like, this one has a very open modern feel to it versus a traditional Japanese restaurant. You can't help to notice the huge screen behind the sushi bar is a cool touch. All the hibachi grills are located on the perimeter of the restaurant with the dinning areas located in the center along with a large bar. Once seated by a beautiful geisha girl (imagine that.lol.) I received quick friendly service and the days special. A very simple menu is easy to navigate. The food is good comes out quick and is well presented. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I was undecided in where to go for my birthday but my hair stylist suggested this restaurant with praise. I tried to book a reservation online but was unable to do so which was slightly frustrating. However I was fortunate enough to call around 5 pm and get a reservation for 6:15  for 8 people on a Sunday night. 

The restaurant was quiet but I didn't mind. Service was okay; but our chef, Ed, was amazing. Tonight was actually his first night as a chef at the restaurant. Congratulations Ed! He was fun and engaging and because of his cooking performance, I'm going to be a repeat customer. 

I've seen some reviews where people are a little disappointed with portion size and price but I was full at the end of my meal with soup and salad included. Not to mention, you're also paying for the Teppanyaki style cooking. 

Try it for yourself :)"}
{"text":"Well we had reservations and we ate 2hrs  later....we went for my fathers birthday and it turned  into nightmare . The waitress was never there and she left the coking station on as high as it could go ! Very poor Service .... However I must say the cooking chef was nice and made us feel welcomed and he was only 18. They need to get more cooks in there for how many people come in and take some lessons on how to handle raw foods!! They are losing business becuz of it . To top it off we never got my dads surprise cake/ice cream and we left having to go back in with a bad stomach ache and use the restrooms . Paid a lot of money for bad food and service and we will never be going back!! We had been 2 times before and never had this type of service with  food!! Don't waste your money on this to get sick !!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to for Asian food hibachi tables are awesome...you get a show while your waiting for your food the chefs are very friendly and usually give me the most portions since you share the table with other guests...always have a good time."}
{"text":"Try the Lychee Martinis. I recommend going for the entertainment. Our chef was very funny. The food taste great. I would definitely return for the shrimp."}
{"text":"Honestly, do NOT waste your time and money. There are many other hibachi/teppan establishments around town that don't allow their staff to get wasted while on the clock. Generally, I prefer to eat at restaurants where the waitstaff come check on you more than once every half hour. I also tend to like to spend my money at places where the management actually cares about your concerns. If you want mediocre food and poor service where you are brought the wrong check 3 times and have to wait an additional 15 minutes to leave, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Phillip makes incredible sushi and Yvonne makes our time there enjoyable.  We love that this place is literally in our backyard.  Have not had the best experience with the teppanyaki chefs here, but the rest of the staff makes up for it."}
{"text":"BEYOND over priced! We paid over $20 a plate when we sat at the fancy hibachi table - okay, fine - there's the show & a decent amount of food. But tonight, we sat at a regular table & paid $9 for a scoop of rice and $18 for a half of a chicken cutlet with an even smaller scoop of rice. The food is good, but not THAT good! Come on now!"}
{"text":"Back we went to Geisha House with another couple, looking forward to another pleasing Teppenyaki Japanese Steakhouse meal.  I at least was not disappointed.

I began with a Sashimi Combo: 9 pieces of sashimi, which were all thick, fresh, and excellent.  This was followed by a good Miso Onion Soup and a nice cold salad with a fresh tomato slice and Ginger Dressing.  While grilling assorted vegetables, our grillmaster wound up discarding too many mushrooms into the chute off the grill, but I got plenty of grilled zucchini, sprouts, and mushrooms on my plate anyway since veggie-hating Diane always awards her share to me.  

I did not receive a large serving of Filet, but it was medium rare as ordered and seasoned just right.  But unfortunately one of my guests said that her chicken was very tough.  Although I have noticed chipped plates here in the past, this time I was happy to see that all the plates we received were new and unchipped.  Although I come for the food, the show at the grill was also fairly good and entertaining.

4-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"Sorry about this late review...I've just now started taking Yelp seriously. In August of last year my roommate wanted her birthday dinner here because she said it was her favorite, so we went with a group of us. I don't like the tight fit at the hibachi tables, the fact that not all my food comes out at one time. I want to be able to eat a whole meal while its hot and not piece by piece. I got the steak and it was flavorless. Our dude was cool though. Maybe if I go back we wont do the hibachi, just regular sit down. I'll update it from there if that ever happens."}
{"text":"geisha house has become my favorite sushi bar !!!!! I have been coming here  for a while but would not have come here had it not been for the chance to try it with one of those wonderful coupons I got online !! We tried it loved it and will continue to be regular customers even though we live  way up at mountains edge !! Hats off to your G.M. He is the best !!! Thank you  Christine  and Steve !!!"}
{"text":"Had the binto box lunch.  Everything was quite good and would have give five stars except for the teriyaki chicken being just a tad over cooked."}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place! Service is great and food is delicious! Chef Eddie's cooking was entertaining! I made reservations on Yelp and had no problem at all! We can't wait it come back!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Geisha House on Flamingo. We were joined at our table by a wonderful family who were visiting from California (one young lady was a Las Vegas local cousin). As luck would have it when the waitress asked if anyone was celebrating a special occasion Matt, one of the sons, said it was his birthday. An interesting coincidence as it was mine as well. This started a very pleasant evening. My wife and I ordered the Geisha special which is a ton of food. The tempura appetizers are lightly coated and very flavorful, a wonderful choice. The soup is very good while the salad is average. The combination of steak, chicken and lobster was a great way to enjoy a range of entrees. After dinner the staff surprised Matt and I with complimentary ice cream desserts with a birthday candle on top. The food was excellent but the service was even better. Our waitress was wonderful and Dillon our chef was personable and did an excellent job. It was a great time for a special occasion  and both parties felt exactly the same way."}
{"text":"Dinner and a show, I think so!!  Our chef was by far the best I have ever seen.  I loved the pink sauce that they put on everything, so good!!  The rice, so delicious!  The filet mignon, melt in your mouth amazing!  However I think my favorite was their sushi!!!  Holy moly!!  Best sushi I've had!!  Writing this review made me hungry and I think I will head back over there!!  Yum yum!!"}
{"text":"good food, fun atmosphere !! one of our favorite spots to eat with no kids, it is kid friendly either way"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks here.  You get dinner and a show.  My steaks have been cooked perfectly every time I've gone.  Their fried rice, which they dye pink, is delicious.  If your local you should stop by."}
{"text":"I go to this very often. I really like these 2 young chef who cooks tappan for us. I was amazed by their talent compare to their young age. Foood quality it was very great! Also their special pink sauce on my fried rice was so good.... sometimes i wish i can have the sauce for my house÷! Store seems clean vibe is good. I recommemd taking ur mates for luxury sake and fire show with great food.
Sometimes i buy these chef beers to. Tall one speaks good english but shorter one, (i belove John) needs to learn more English. I HAD GREAT TIME HERE AND HOOE YOU ALL ENJOY"}
{"text":"A group of us went to Geisha House for the teppanyaki and had a great time.  The prices were reasonable and the special, which was chicken, filet mignon, and lobster, all with the included sides of veggies, rice, soup and salad, was only like $35.  My friend and I both ordered a roll, mine was the What the Heck and she ordered Tastes Like My Ex-Girlfriend, they were both delicious but the rolls in addition to the grill food was soooo much food!!!  It all made great leftovers :D
The teppanyaki show was, of course, very fun.  Our chef was sociable and talented at volcanoes and egg cracking.  This places uses pink butter which I found a little weird (perhaps to hide undercooked food?  I'm not saying they have undercooked food, I'm just being a bit of a conspiracy theorist), but still tastes amazing and all your food has a pretty pink colour!
Service was excellent, my roll was made in the wrong order but with all the right ingredients, and the manager brought it out to make sure that was okay, which I thought was a nice touch.  The soup was very good, I can't remember what all was in it but we all enjoyed it.  There is a peach sake - YOU WANT THAT.  Do not drink it as a beer or wine cooler, even though it may appear to be and taste like one.  My hubby loves teppanyaki and I'm a big sushi fan; this is definitely our new favourite place when we're craving those!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon shortly before coming here for dinner. My wife and I are big fans of sushi and we have tried several places in town. My review is strictly going to be about my experience at the sushi bar. They have the cooking tables for parties where a chef cooks in front of you, but I only had the luxury of witnessing that part of the restaurant in action from the sushi bar.

Overall, the sushi was really good. They had nice quality fish and they dressed up all the rolls quite nicely when they serve it to you. The Decor in the place was contemporary and aesthetically pleasing. I was very happy when I found out that they serve beer by the pitcher because you get a better bargain than buying the glasses individually. Also, they serve spicy garlic edamame which I enjoy but my wife really enjoys and making wife happy is always a plus.

The Sushi bar has a couple big-screen TVs where you can watch sporting events and seems like it would be a great place to catch a game if that's your thing. This restaurant is a little more higher end and so you won't be finding all you can eat sushi as part of the menu. I find that sushi that is served a la cart is better anyway. I was a little bummed that they didn't have Uni available because I'm huge fan but that isn't uncommon at a lot of places that serve sushi.

Overall, the wife and I enjoyed a nice dining experience. I imagine we will be back in the near future since we are moving to the area next month."}
{"text":"I just posted a review of the Geisha Steak house stating I was not pleased with the service but stated the food was still amazing after all the years we have gone there.  WOW!!! 1 hour after I wrote the review, the manager called me and sincerely apologized  for the service and is sending a gift certificate.  I am moving back to the desert soon and look forward to trying this location again for my birthday.  I am changing my rating from a 2 star to a 5 star because it is nice to have my concerns treated with respect.  I grew up in Las Vegas and the Geisha has been around for many years.  It is that way for a reason."}
{"text":"Sushi is the best part about this place. Other then that it's ok. They are either a hit or a miss when it comes to there hibachi and other then the random hour changes nothing to big. Will only go back for the sushi."}
{"text":"It was ok. We went in a Tuesday night, we were in and seated within a 5 minutes. our server was very efficient in getting the food. We ordered the special for 34.99 a person which includes filet mignon, shrimp, chicken, and lobster with either sake,"}
{"text":"What's with the secret Pink sauces that they put on EVERYTHING when you have a teppanyaki dinner? Personally, I do not like artificial coloring on everything that I am eating. Pink rice, Pink shrimp, Pink Vegetables... I think they should ask you if you'd like the 'house sauce\" on everything and it should be optional not standard.  I will not be returning here for teppayaki anytime soon, unless they remove the mandatory pink sauce rule."}
{"text":"Food is really good quality! However no free soup and hot tea which is usually given at Japanese restaurants, and pricey."}
{"text":"There were 5 of us and 2 were small children.  The service catered to the kids and that made the evening fun and if the food had matched the service it would have been a solid 4 stars!  The food was 3 stars.  I had the shrimp and they were cooked well and seasoned nicely.  See Michael R. rating for the rest of the food, he was in our party and I totally agree with his rating and thought for the cost of the evening the food should have been a little better quality.  Not bad and we would go back."}
{"text":"We came here for a Naked Sushi Event.
Definitely not like what you have seen on TV. 

Thank God we had a Groupon for this otherwise it was $45 a person. 
We arrived here late so pickings were slim (no pun intended) there was hardly any food left. All we managed to get was some fried rice from the Benihana-type chef and some leftover spicy tuna roll pieces. They did have some hot food out but buffalo wings do not go with sushi well my friend. Fail on the food selection. For $45 I would expect a far better selection for food. I am not bitching too much because 1. I had a Groupon 2. I came a little late. 


I give the owners/managers an A for effort in trying something exotic. They tried create a lively atmosphere however it felt more like I was visiting a house party versus attending an event. So it was an Epic Fail on the ambiance. 

The only thing that I can wonder is how is their food and service on a non nekked night?!? 

I know I don't care to find out.."}
{"text":"Reflecting back on my visit here a few months ago, with a unbiased neutral mind, my experience here was been THE worst of my life. 

Went in on a Friday night with a group of 5 after seeing an advertised special of 14.99 all you can eat sushi. 

When we got there, it was fairly empty but we weren't seated for about 15 minutes, for no given reason at all. After being seated, we sat for another 10 minutes after our waitress disappeared, without any notice or even leaving of any menus at all. When she came back to fianlly take our drink orders, she told us that the tiny piece of paper in the plastic display was the menu. It was then we foud out that the special 14.99 menu was limited to about 6-7 different items from the very basic nigiri (salmon, tuna, shrimp) to a few plain, unoriginal rolls (California, phill, spicy tuna). No appetizers, no included drinks, just those. Dissatisfied and irritated already, I asked to see a regular menu becuase I wasn't feeeling for any of those, she snarled and said \"no a.y.c.e. on the full menu, you have to pay full price.\" I didn't ask for the prices, I asked for the menu. Her farfetched assumption that we were cheap was very insulting. We shouldve left then, but we didn't.
 
There was a selection of happy hour cocktails and mixed drinks that we ordered some of which never arrived at all. Some chose to order off the regular menu, some chose the AYCE and one, so turned off by the way things were going simply didn't want to eat anything. 

The food came out extremely slowly for the AYCE, often all on one big plate, left for us to divide them across the table in confusion. The sushi was very very mediocre, need I say I've had some better prepackaged supermarket brands. Nigiri had too much rice, sushi rice being too cold and lacking vinegar and the fish being hardly fresh. The rolls were not bad nor great, just.. Boring. 

During the entire time our party was dining, we didn't recieve one polite gesture from the waitress, or even the bussers.

The tipping point of the whole night was at the end. After asking for the bill, which was a difficult task simply because we could barely get a hold of our server, she delivered it and vanished once more. Ahh, the problems arose. We were grossly overcharged. She charged us for 6 AYCE's and all the cocktails we ordered were full price. When we asked her about it, she claimed that the non-ayce patrons ate fron the ayce's plate. That was not the case, trust me, I hardly doubt they were dying to sneak a bite of a California roll. She insisted that was the case and even started to argue. Also when asked about the drinks, she said that we ordered them after the happy hour time, when in reality the fact that we got our drinks 30 minutes after we ordered them due to the entire staffs negligence was probably why she thought we ordered them late. Also and the kicker? There was a crazy, \"$5 service charge\" added to every single AYCE dinner patron, which brought the actual price of it to 19.99 per person. Never in my life had I heard of hidden fees at a restaraunt. Cars and homes? I understand. Dinner? are you kidding me?
Our entire party furious, we spoke with the manager explaining the entire situation, and the most he did was take off all the mistakes, even still that was only done because of us claiming we wouldn't pay if it was corrected. 

To further rate this place, I'll do it on a rubric based out of 100 points. 

Food Speed: 30/100
Food Quality: 50/100
Service: 0/100
Decor: 65/100
Price: 40/100

Avoid, avoid, avoid. Service here is what kills it, and I know it wasn't just a bad day or just that particular waitress because I work at the starbucks in the same plaza ad see them regularly. Most of the staff is extremely rude and snobby."}
{"text":"Horrible service do not eat here !!!
I ordered Japanese lasagna and it comes with eel sauce on top of it and I asked for extra on the side .. there wasn't even any on top of it they only put on the side..didn't even give me an extra and then when I continue to look in the bag ..the server trued  snatching it out of my hand... smh"}
{"text":"Awesome food and a great show to go with it. You get the whole experience with the expert shefs, while enjoying the food. Came in for a conveniece, left with a complete satisfaction from great food and atmosphere. Fairly affordable price is also a huge plus."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since this place has opened...

Food - Great
Atmosphere - Great, Just like the Sapporos that was there previously.
Prices - Opening specials were amazing, Prices on menu were fair
Service - Horrible... All our waitress did was flirt with the manager/owner and twirl her hair for him while we sat waiting for our roll that she forgot to put in, our waters that needed to be refilled, and lastly the check!!!"}
{"text":"So I took mom to dinner last night here, got to say the good was great I've been here a few time, they seem short handed not sure if the a missing chef or Sunday's they run on a 2 man crew, the chef was great and the food was even better, the wait time was at best painful, the chef prepared food for 2 other tables before ours.

I will be back and if they have more chefs working I will up date my review.

Also I forgot to mention if you have not been here in a wile they have updated the look of the place."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch and happy hour and enjoyed our meal very much I have to say the winner of the entire meal was the desert they brought a salad and some French toast looking box that had fruit on top it was delicious crispy on the outside and super more ice on the inside I would definitely have that again"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my family, we wanted to try something different so we decided on this place.

ATMOSPHERE: We came in right when dinner service was about to start, so the place was basically empty.  The decor was really nice and the bar had a HUGE tv set up behind which was cool.  I'll probably have to check this place out once it's later at night to see it's full potential.  It's cool because there are teppanyaki grills, a nice bar, high tables and regular booths so there are options for big or small groups. 

FOOD: The food itself had it's highs and lows.  My family and I went with the teppanyaki grill and we ordered from that menu.  I myself ordered New York Strip steak with the rest of the other food.  The steak itself was good, cooked to medium, the vegetables cooked on the grill were good.  The ONLY thing I question is the use of the \"pink sauce.\"  Our chef Kevin even said it's something that not all people enjoy and I wasn't one of them.  It's some sort of seasoning combination that really didn't add much to the food.  He put it on everything basically but I'm sure that he has to as part of the job.  Would much rather prefer actual spices on the food.

SERVICE: Service was decent at best, but our chef Kevin was the one that stood out.  He was really cool, personable and joking with us while he was cooking.  Pretty young start-up in the teppanyaki game, but I hope he does well and makes his way up to the higher standards of teppanyaki restaurants like those on the Strip.  He made the whole experience worth it."}
{"text":"Went there for Valentine's Day. They had a different menu that they didn't tell me when placing the reservation. Our server was awful. She forgot about drinks and didn't give our table the included salads. After taking our orders, we didn't see her again until she brought our checks out. The other servers were taking care of us. Jorge was excellent and is one of our favorite chefs. Would have been a better experience if we had a better server"}
{"text":"I had the New York Steak dinner and everything was delicious. I ate every single bite. The fried rice is the best I've ever had. It was about 23 dollars, by I'll definitely come back."}
