{"text":"We ordered BRUSCHETTA and BAKED OYSTER MUSHROOMS.  The Mushrooms are very well cooked and tasty. For the main course, I ordered BLACK COD that is good, it can be a bit more tender.  The taste is good but the texture is not what I usually expected. The dessert Vanilla Bean Crème Brulee is very good too.  This is a $$$ restaurant and the bill comes to $120.

We found that this restaurant on our night most of the patrons are middle age to seniors. May be it will change once after late night when the restaurant becomes a pub."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night drink and i like the place. Very nice layout, and could tell it is a place to bring a date. The DJ wasn't bad and the bar is big and spacious. The outdoor area has a fireplace and gas warmers with another bar. The crowd on late nights are a little older (40's and 50's) but once in a while you will see some younger people around. The drinks are poured light though so be prepared to spend some dough."}
{"text":"I've been to Brix a couple of times while visiting Markham on business.
If you are in the area it's a good venue to entertain clients or catch a game at the bar.

They do have a pretty good wine list and a wide ranging menu. Previously I've had their daily fish special and steak. On my last visit I went lite and had the angus steak salad. Dinner has been consistently good, the service professional and knowledge. 

If you find yourself in one of the surrounding hotels Brix is a good dining option."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night; I was greeted at the door warmly. We were seated and quickly prompted to ordering to drinks. Great interior, so it seemed like it was going to be an enjoyable time. 

Unfortunately that was not the case. We ordered our food with our friendly waitress and received our appetizers within a reasonably time. But before the plates were finished a skinny busboy comes to the table asking if he can take those plates, which clearly had food on it still. So after a funny look from everyone and politely telling him that we were still working on it, he walked away. However not too long after he comes back and starts taking plates off our table. True, some were empty which by all means, take it. But he takes plates that still clearly have food on it as well. A few of us told him to hold on, and took the food off. How were we able to enjoy the food if you felt like you were being rushed?  

Wellll....they  did gave us some time to enjoy each other's company for a bit...they gave us about an hour and a half to talk to each other until our meals FINALLY came. I had order the salad with chicken, I had specifically asked the waitress to make sure that the chicken would not be too dry, and she assured me it wouldn't. Of course when we FINALLY got our meal, mine came with a dry piece of chicken, I even asked her to try it herself. She apologized and asked if I would like to send it back. As I didn't really want my new piece of chicken whipped across the floor in the kitchen. I told her it was ok, as I was going for the salad anyways. We got a great waitress, but the overall service of the place was disgusting especially for the prices they were charging.

 I mean the prices of the food was reasonable, although the food wasn't that spectacular. But the prices they were charging for drinks was ridiculously high.Let's put it this way, my bill way over $100 bucks, my meal cost about $20 and i had order about 4 or 5 drinks, as it was for the birthday girl of our party. I should mention that we all had our own separated bills. Not to mention that they added 18% gratuity to the bill right off the bat. I mean I would usually give a min of 10-15% even if the service was bad and 20-25% for great service, but to have the audacity of expecting for 18% for service that you haven't yet delivered.   Hell and here i thought the CN Tower 360 was over charging. I mean I wouldn't mind paying those kind of prices when I go into a restaurant with great service. Not that 360 has great service but it at least have the view. But this is a place that charges like it has something great to offer, but lacks the ability to deliver. 

It came off as an over priced, mediocre, cougar bar/restaurant than a place i would go to enjoy a nice dinner with friends and family."}
{"text":"I've gone there 2 times in the last month, and both times were great!  Their calamari is very good, lightly breaded and crispy.  it comes in a very big portion for an appetizer.
The first time we went we had the Lamb as well as a fish (can't remember what type), but we were not disappointed, and we were very full.  Even though the portions didn't look that big, they were filling.  Of course, it could have been the Calamari appetizer that filled us up.

The 2nd time we went, I had the burger, and my companion had the Tuna salad (tuna tartar).  That was excellent.  The burger was just OK, nothing spectacular, but the sweet potatoe fries were really good, worth the extra $1 or so.

I would recommend this place...it's a great alternative to Moxies or The Keg.  Definitely a step up from the usual family places like Jack Astors or Alice Fazooli's.  I wouldn't call this place a family restaurant by any means, as it's clear it is for the working professional with the big bar, pool table, and live music."}
{"text":"Like so many of the restaurants in this area, Brix's interior will blow you away. At least from an outsider's perspective. It's gorgeous inside. Just like Napa! 

I love Napa Valley, and this restaurant is true to its name. Delicious options for lunch and dinner. Delectable desserts. Excellent wines. Fast and friendly service. Everything I look for in a great restaurant.

I love that the menu lists recommended wine pairings with several items, too. And not just for the entrees.

CA(lifornia) meets CA(nada). 
What a wonderful pairing."}
{"text":"I came here with absolutely no expectations. I've never even heard of this restaurant until my friend asked me if I wanted to eat here since she has a coupon deal ($15 for $70 worth of food, great deal, I know).

I had some difficulty choosing something off their menu because nothing really jumped out at me. I settled for the daily special which was the rigatoni ($16) with duck meat, olives and goat cheese. I really enjoyed this dish because it was a combination of everything I enjoyed.

My friend got the the normal rigatoni ($16) off their regular menu. It had mushrooms, grilled chicken and tomatoes in it. It was also really good. The portion size was also decent.

The couple at our table got panko sesame chicken strips with Thai dipping sauce ($11) and certified angus beef strip loin with shallot, tomato and garlic mash potato ($28). The chicken strips were great with the sauce and my friends said that the beef was soft.

Overall, the food here is great. The inside of the restaurant is very clean and has a good atmosphere. The service however, was very slow. Waiting for the bill, dessert menu and ordering took forever. We saw the waitress for the other tables walking around more than our waitress. We had to flagged down the bus boys a couple of times to get our waitress for us.

I wouldn't come here again because the service was unbelievably slow which is unfortunate because the food here was decent."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Brix Napa Valley was like years ago... I found their food uninspiring and overpriced.... and years later with my recent visit, I still felt the same...and maybe it will be years later again before I would even bother coming back... 

I am glad to be invited as one of the foursomes to utilized a group buy deal at Brix Napa Valley.. Friends, Food, Wine and Deal... I am IN! 

Empty restaurant on Tuesdays... no cougar...no preys...just us Yelpers drinking wine and talking nonsense....... 

2 drinkers in our group that we have no problems finished the 2 bottles of wine... Wine selections are good but pricey.... 

I got to sample the following: 

Tuna Tacos ($14) 
Brix Truffle Fries ($7) 
Black Cod ($28) 
Slow Roast Lamb ($29) 
Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli ($17) 
Sticky Toffee & Date Pudding ($6.75) 
Molten Chocolate Fondant ($6.75) 

All of the above tasted OK... but I found them not worth the price they were charging..... and they tasted like food that are from those big chained restaurants with not much character to them! 

Don't bring a Vegetarian friend! On the menu the only choice for vegetarian is the Ravioli... But if your vegetarian friend is just a heavy drinker then just order her a bottle of wine and some fries! 

I don't think I'll be back....."}
{"text":"For the longest time, I've been trying to use my Dealfind coupon to Brix Napa Valley Grill  ($15 for $70 of food with no expiration date). Since then, I've read numerous bad reviews on this restaurant, so I never had the incentive to go try it out. Finally, I decided to give this place a try.

Now onto the food:

Panko sesame chicken strips with Thai dipping sauce. It was basically a slightly more refined version of chicken fingers with an Asian spin. However, the Thai dipping sauce tasted just like regular plum sauce.  Nevertheless, it was quite tasty and I was satisfied with my dish. 

Rigatoni tossed with pulled lamb shank, olives, capers, spinach, and goat cheese spicy tomato ragu. Since I hate lamb and goat cheese, this pasta did not appeal to me. However, my friend liked it  

Rigatoni from the regular menu, featuring sautéed assorted fresh mushrooms, grilled chicken, tomatoes and a light coffee velouté. My other friend who got this also enjoyed her pasta, and the portion was pretty decent. 

Angus beef strip loin with shallot, tomato, natural jus and garlic mash to be passable. I had a few bites and thought that it was pretty decent. The meat was adequately tender, and it came out medium, just the way that he asked for. 

So overall, the food was pretty good. The big problem was the service: it was incredibly slow! We had to flag down other waiters to locate our waitress multiple times. Waiting for the dessert menu and the bill took ages! 

That said, the restaurant still exceeded my expectations, since I had absolutely none to begin with. I think the place tries too hard to be a lounge. However, I'm glad that I finally got to use my dealfind coupon! But I wouldn't come here if I had to pay regular price for sure."}
