{"text":"I don't even want to give this place a 1 star. This review is based on the fact that I wasn't even able to enter the restaurant at 11:30 on a Monday, when the restaurant is advertised to open. I had called the restaurant and no one picked up at 11:30. I waited some more and called the second time and a lady picked up and told me the restaurant was indeed open. I go back and restaurant is still closed. I knock, no response. By 11:45 i call for the 3rd time, a gentleman picks up and says they're \"getting ready\". GETTING READY????? Then don't advertise to the public that your opening time is 11:30. Let me tell you these folks do not have the right MINDSET. They do not care about the promise they make to their customers and that should be enough to drive the rest of you away (who are considering to go). DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. You will be disappointed"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for some good north Indian food which is unfortunately quite rare to come by in GTA especially York region, we found this reataurant in Yelp and were suprised with the quality and taste of buffet on a Saturday. The chicken and lamb were tender and had all the right spices that we were looking forward to. The vegetables and lentils were fresh and upto the mark even though personally I found them a bit bland. All in all quite a satisfying experience in terms of the right tasting and reasonably prices North Indian buffet!"}
{"text":"We came here on a long weekend Sunday when many of our usual Indian food haunts were closed, and were pleasantly surprised. Flavourful and plentiful, each dish was expertly executed. Staff and service were prompt and attentive. Best dish was kadai chicken. Great naan. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Significantly improved since opening. Give it a try if you're craving Indian for dinner or lunch!"}
{"text":"When I have a craving for Indian, this is my go to place for lunch.   They have a nice variety of vegetable and meat dishes.  The Chana masala is lovely!   And I appreciate the freshly made naan too.  If you haven't tried this place, you should!"}
{"text":"Delicious buffet menu! Although they don't explicitly have a halal sign outside the store, there is a certification posted inside stating that the meat is halal. I went for the lunch buffet and it was definitely worth the price! There were a lot of different meals to choose from, both veggie and meat based. They also had gulab jamuns for dessert which made everything 10x better. The service was great! They consistently refilled our naan basket and water. I would definitely go back again for another buffet :)"}
{"text":"This is a fairly new restaurant and we've now been there around 4 or 5 times and every time it's been excellent.  The service is very good with recommendations if you're not sure what to order (and my wife and I weren't) and the food has been wonderful every time. We've been to many restaurants and being consistently good with many different dishes has always been a problem.  The atmosphere is nice with nice music in the background. Tonight we shared a khatti meethi paneer (sweet and sour saut√©ed Indian cheese) as an appetizer. Sounds a little weird but is a little bit of heaven. Also had the saag lamb, basmati rice and methi naan. More heaven. So if you like Indian food, this is an excellent restaurant choice. I know my wife and I will continue to go back regularly. Oh, and the Indian beer goes very nicely with everything."}
{"text":"You should come to this place for really great food. The service and food is authentic. It's not a fancy place or sophisticated dining. Just simply has great food and  at very very reasonable prices. They are trying hard. Totally worth eating here for a tasty meal or getting take out. The food is significantly better tasting than most TORONTO Indian restaurants these days.  I came here with 2 friends close to their closing time. The staff were very accommodating. We had a great meal! Thank you."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time last night, I have tried their weekend lunch buffet before which is good, but their regular menu is amazing!  The decor is pleasant and inviting, its a large open restaurant and the service is great.   The food: we tried pani puri, fish pakora, chicken pakora, aloo tikki, triple trouble chicken, dum chicken biryani and garlic naan. The pakora's were great- soft and flavourful, triple trouble chicken is a mixed sizzler with 2 pieces each of- kashmiri, hariyali, and chicken tikka, all very good and cooked to perfection. I loved the pani puri, they were full of channa, potato, herbs and spices - probably one of the best I've had from a restaurant. Dum chicken biryani was very aromatic and flavourful with lots of chicken pieces! Garlic naan was soft and fresh - a bit too much garlic for my liking, but that was probably my only complaint from the whole experience. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed our meal.   I am excited to have a new go-to Indian place in the Markham area!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! This used to be Al Dente and is now turned into an Indian restaurant. The interior is similar to what is used to look like when it was the Italian restaurant. Very cozy and a good setup. The service was spectacular the day we were there, they were so attentive and brought out dishes after dishes of fantastic food. It's all you can eat, but it comes out fresh. Price wise it's very fair for what you get. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to 39 Spices for lunch this week.   The buffet lunch was outstanding.  This is all you can eat, but the dishes are prepared on demand any brought to your table.   The vegetable appetizer and skewered chicken were both very good.  The chicken and lamb curry were both excellent.  Well spiced but not \"hot spicy\", which I resolved by asking for chilli sauce and cut chilli peppers.  The basmati rice and naan bread were perfectly done.  The lentil dish was ok, I am not fan of lentils so cannot objectively critique.   I liked the fact that food is made on demand and brought to your table piping hot...also helps me not over eat as I would have loaded up on more naan an rice.   I will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Not that impressed. Ordered takeout and waited twenty minutes plus after calling ahead and waiting twenty five minutes. They weren't overly friendly and non apologetic for making me wait. Food was sub par at best and over priced, doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst service I've ever gotten. The naan is very burnt, not chewable and when we called to complain, with my surprise I was answered from the owner saying that they cannot do anything. If I could put a 0 star option I would use that option for this restaurant. The picture provided is exactly how we got the naan."}
{"text":"Love the saag chicken, buriyani and naans! We get food here once a week and the flavours are always consistent. The staff and owner are really friendly!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from away and was looking for a place to try. This came up as a place near by so I figured I'd give it a go. I called to place an order for take out and the man on the other end of the phone was so kind and helpful. When I went to pick up the food costumer service was above and beyond. We tried the Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Biryani and butter naan. The food was superb. I would definitely recommend and will visit again myself."}
{"text":"I came here today for the lunch buffet with my family, since we were craving Indian food. The space is nice and there's a good amount of parking out back. That is especially helpful as Main Street can get pretty busy and finding street parking can be challenging sometimes. We were promptly seated in the \"greenhouse\" area of the restaurant, near the buffet station.  39 Spices had an average selection for food, on par with other Indian buffets I've been to. They had a variety of chutneys and curries to choose from. The best dish was the curry goat, the pieces of goat were succulent and tender, and the sauce was tasty. Overall, I found the food to be quite westernized, and there was very little heat to any of the food. I'm not complaining too much about that as I don't eat super spicy, but some spice would have been nice. I did not like the butter chicken though, I found it overly sweet and not enjoyable. The tandoori chicken was also done very well. The other foods I tried were decent, but I've definitely had better.  My biggest issue is that the food wasn't hot. I don't know if it's because of the time we got there, and the turnover was slow (they open at 11:30 a.m., we got there about 5 past noon). The basmati rice was lukewarm at best, and same with other dishes. They need to find a way to keep the food hotter. The naan bread is made separately and served in baskets after you're seated, so the bread was pipping hot and delicious.   Service was good as well, servers were attentive and quick at clearing plates. Would I return? I don't know. In a pinch, yes, I would come back if I was really craving Indian, but would probably try some other places first."}
{"text":"This place is nearby, serves pretty decent Indian food and has good service right in Markham.  We tried the bread basket which was great and had just enough variety for the naan to go with the curries and we also tried the shrimp  Dum Briyani - which was fabulous.   We tried two vegetarian curries and the lobster masala. They were all pretty flavourful and spicy as we requested ( if you can't handle spice, ask for it to be mild).  The mango lassi was great too.  Parking is out back or on the street depending on what you prefer. This is a great place, with pretty decent service, good food and a reasonable price  for North Indian cuisine  in Markham."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet on a weekday. Friendly staff, food was good quality. There was a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Convenient parking at the back of the restaurant. Would definitely come here again the next time I'm craving Indian food!"}
{"text":"I have been  driving by the place for months and finally got to try it !!  And I definitely will be returning.   We ordered the chicken tikka masala and paneer makhni as our main dishes. But dishes were flavourful and fresh. Usually the dishes take some time to come out to the table, so order right away. To compliment the dishes we got the garlic naan. Warm, hot and fresh !! But careful not to kiss anyone after, the garlic flavours linger...lol   You can see the kitchen from the dining area, which is fun to watch.  Right above the kitchen sit the 39 magical spices !!! But I'm sure they use more.   There is plenty of seating and they have a buffet during lunch hours. Will have to return for the buffet one day."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. Recommend it to anyone who's in the mood for great Indian food. Everything was perfect and the service was fantastic. Meet with the owners and are super friendly and amazing people. Great food great service"}
{"text":"Ambience: a dirty old fountain outside does not inspire confidence. Weird disco lighting inside with some muggy skylights also did not spark inspiration. Not overly busy around 6-8 pm on a Monday long weekend.  Service: solid but not great. Offered hot towelettes at the end of the meal for our hands.   Food: very delicious curries and portions were quite filling, even though they don't look impressive on sight. Each dish is meant to be shared between two people (but will not fill them) which helps to explain the large price tags. However, none of the entrees come with any carb so the overall bill is even more expensive.   Expect to spend anywhere from $15-30 per entree here to fill one person. Overall, this place is meant to share food.   We ordered two mixed bread baskets ($10/each) + a garlic naan for 7 people. Definitely pricey for something that other places offer with the entrees. At least quality is good.   General comments: Food did take about 40 minutes so order quickly as it takes a while.   Total bill ended up being 109 before tip for 7 full people."}
{"text":"We came here based off the yelp reviews for their lunch buffet and were left questioning if the previous reviews were real. I believe they changed the format of their buffet from a table order service to a hot table, which may explain the decline in quality.   The selection was minimal, food was cold (mind you we were there pretty much at opening on a Sunday), no hot naans delivered to your table (which is customary at almost all ayce Indian restaurants), food was mediocre at best however the service was pleasant.   I would say the food is decent for what it is, but there are better options around the Markham/Richmond Hill/Scarborough area.   I will not return."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The food and service were awesome!! Will totally be back!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the $10.99 lunch buffet. It isn't set up like your typical indian lunch buffet with a food line and warmers. The dishes are all made to order and brougt to your table from the kitchen. There are enough options to keep you satisfied, but not nearly as many options as India's Taste, Brar and other Indian Buffets.   Menu Options: - 1 type of salad - 1 type of soup - 2 appetizers (1 veg, 1 meat) - 2 vegetable dishes - 2 meat dishes - 1 daily dal option - 1 type of dessert  The food quality was great, much better than Indias Taste. There was more attention to detail, the chicken breast was moist and the paneer texture was delicious, it was browned before it was added to the dish.. I hate when restaurants throw it in straight from the package.  Favourite Dishes - Matar Paneer (delicious) and the Eggplant.  I was told they would soon be switching to the  buffet line set up instead of table service. Hopefully the food quality stays the same!  I am also going to note how clean the restaurant is. I saw the manager wiping tables down with a disinfectant cleaning agent after diners left. It's refreshing to see something  other than a dirty cloth with food grime being used to sterilize tables."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and good food. Loved the service which was top notch. We ordered mutton Korma and biriyani which was tasty and made to our spice level. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with my mother for dinner when we've had Indian food cravings, and this establishment definitely lives up to that craving and more. I'm a little disappointed at the lack of traffic during weekday evenings, but I'm hoping that's just from the two times I've been there.  The restaurant is quiet and a little dim on the inside - on the patio, it's quite lovely if the weather is right. The overall atmosphere is a quite, middle-class place to dine on Indian cuisine. The waiter was very friendly and are able to recommend good dishes, along with those that might not popular (I'm not a fan of cucumber yogurt) - we ended up getting Chicken Dum Biryani, Lamb Vindaloo, and Garlic Naan Bread. These three items absolutely hit the spot, and I couldn't find any fault with any of the dishes. Only that I couldn't finish it all off before I was full!   I really do hope that more people give this restaurant some more love during weekday evenings - their food is excellent, service is good, atmosphere/cleanliness is great, and not an expensive joint to be chowing down on curry and rice. Will definitely be coming back for more Indian cravings."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was pretty decent. Flavors are more North Indian in general. Gobi Manchuria and chicken biriyani were really good!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight.  There were 10 of us in total, so we got to sample quite a lot of dishes.  We started off with various starters including the variety veg platter, khatti meethi gobi and extra veg samosas.  The starters were all nicely presented and had lots of flavour.  Next we had a few tandoori meats.  The chicken was really tender and juicy, even though it was white meat.  For mains we ordered 2√ó veg dum biryani, saag chicken, chicken tikka masala, kadai lamb, lamb rogan josh, aloo gobi masala and methi malai mutter.  We also got butter and garlic naan breads too.  All the dishes were really good, all had their unique spices and flavours.  The meats were all done nicely, not dry or chewy, just tender.    This is a great place for authentic Indian cuisine, something that I've missed, since I moved to Canada, from England.  They are able to customize spice levels and make dishes that aren't on the menu.  I enquired about my favourite jalfrezi dish and they said they could make it for me.  Most places don't even know what it is.  I will definitely get it next time I come.  It wasn't very busy when we came but there were a lot of people ordering takeout.  The staff are really pleasant and friendly too.  If you've never tried Indian food, they serve lunch buffet.  So you can get to try a few dishes out for a really good price."}
{"text":"Our fav restaurant in the area! Amazing, original, authentic!!! Beautiful inside, very clean, quiet, perfect for romantic or family dining."}
{"text":"I have eaten from here a few times but only delivery/takeout. The food is absolutely delicious. In markham there is so many Indian restaurants but the taste just does not compare. I will visit the restaurant one day to dine in!!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"WOHOO!!! Indian food near my house! This review is based off of 39 Spices dinner menu. Located right on main street Markham, 39 spices is located fairly close to Highway 7 on the right side if you're driving up north on Markham Road.  Entering in, the ambience is somewhat fancy - people come in wearing nicer clothes, but they won't kick you out of the restaurant if you're dressing a bit down for the occasion.   We ordered the Butter Chicken $14.95 and another one of the lamb curry dishes which was also around the same price. In addition, we got a mix bread basket which was $9.95 which had naan, paratha and rotis included in the bread basket.   All of these were delicious meals! really enjoyed the hot naan and paratha from 39 spices, and their spice level was just right - not too spicy if you ask for mild!"}
{"text":"What a great new restaurant in the markham main st area!!! Ordered take out this weekend -- butter chicken, vegetarian biryani, triple trouble chicken, and the mixed bread basket. We got delivery and it arrived within 45 mins and it was fresh and piping hot. Would def order again and try the different dishes."}
{"text":"I picked up a jar of a well known brand of butter chicken sauce at Costco. I wanted a quick shortcut where all i had to do was add the chicken & cook, while i made my own rice at home. I really wanted some Naan to complete my meal and my hubby wanted some tandoori chicken. Normally we go to Unionville to dine in or get take out, but i didn't want my hubby to go out of his way, so i suggested 39 Spices since it's a lot closer to where we live and on his way.  I called the restaurant to pre-order so my hubby could pick it up on his way home from work. The gentleman i spoke to (i'm assuming owner or manager) was very nice and asked if i had anything to eat with the Naan or if i wanted to order anything to eat with it such as an order of their butter chicken. I was REALLY tempted to, but I explained what my dinner plans were for the night and politely declined. I explained that we wanted to stop in for lunch try out their food another day. He was very helpful and answered a few question i had about their menu items & lunch pricing etc.   I ordered the Naan, tandoori chicken (my hubby's fav!) and an order of vegetable pakoras.  Hubby brought the food home, it smelled SO good! I started to unpack and noticed an extra container of food. I thought maybe my hubby had decided to order more food? Wasn't sure. That wasn't the case at all! They had sent me a small container of their butter chicken to try. Very small with just 3-4 pieces of chicken with the sauce. Super impressed by that gesture. OMG...it was delicious!! One of the best butter chickens i've tasted, the pakoras were fresh and cooked to perfection - seasoning was on point! The tandoori chicken was made fresh and it showed in the taste. I ditched the the pre-made butter chicken i bought and dove right into the yummy butter chicken, naan, tandoori chicken & pakoras with my hubby! I called the restaurant immediately after trying the food and thanked the owner for his kind gesture!  That's the way to treat customers & bring them in to your place of business!   FYI lunch buffet is only $10.99 and they offer vegetarian & non vegetarian options.  Wonderful addition to Main Street Markham! Looking forward to going in for lunch or dinner very soon!"}
{"text":"One of the best indian buffets I've been to. It's a small restaurant and very clean. The staff were very attentive and quick to seat us. By far the best veggie pakora and goat curry I've ever tasted. The goat was not tough and it practically fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. Everything tasted very fresh, even the naan were made to order and were cooked perfectly. They could've had more of a selection for the buffet but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I dined-in and gotten take-out from 39 Spices a number of times now, and I have yet to be disappointed. Their samosas are excellent, and my go-to appetizer everytime I'm here, and their butter chicken is AMAZING. Definitely check it out on Main Street if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"What a gem! This place is definitely worth a try! The food was delicious and affordable! ($11.99 weekdays and $12.99 weekends)  I came for the lunch buffet and was not disappointed at all. They recently changed to a buffet line where you can take your own food. The selection is smaller than other places, but they make up in flavour and freshness. All the dishes were good, but the curry goat and butter chicken was absolutely divine! Don't forget about the fresh naan either!   Definitely my lunch go-to place for Indian food."}
{"text":"A huge shout out to the best Indian food I have had in Toronto .. I discovered this place by coincidence.. I was walking down Main Street and the beautiful aromatic smell of their food brought me in.. I ordered takeout .. butter chicken, paneer tikka masala, and veg biryani .. the 3 dishes are perfect, the smell, the spices, the colour.. this place is a gem...  The staff is friendly, attentive, and helpful. They even offered me a drink while I wait for my takeout... I will definitely be coming back every week..."}
{"text":"In searching for a restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday, 39 Spices made the short list, based on the good reviews on Yelp, so we reserved a table of ten. None of us had been there before but we all love Indian food and love to explore new restaurants.  Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated in a larger dining space towards the back of the restaurant. It's a lot bigger than it appears from outside. There is also a sizable patio out front but the cool damp spring weather made it unsuitable for this visit.  We started off with cocktails and an assortment of appetizers while waiting for the guest of honour and a couple of friends. A vegetable platter of samosa, aloo tikki, harabara kabab, and paneer offered some tasty choices to nibble on. The mango salad was also very tasty but could have used a little more mango and less dressing. The chicken pakora, papadum, and naan were also very good, a good start to our meal.  Our entrees included butter chicken (a must-have at any Indian restaurant), paneer, channa, chicken biryani, lamb biryani, and a tandoori platter of paneer tikka, lamb kebab, chicken tikka, and fish tikka. We just had to order more of the delicious naan.  Everything tasted really good, rich with flavour. The butter chicken was a bit on the sweet side but good. The goat was enjoyed by everybody, even those that had reservations about it tasting gamey. The channa (chickpeas) was excellent. Although the overall presentation could have been a little nicer, we were all very happy with the flavours.  The service was mostly good. We hung around for a while after our meal was finished, just catching up with friends, sharing some laughs. Our servers were very patient. We asked one of them to take a picture of our group and she even cleared a lot of things off the table before taking a few shots that all turned out well.  On our way out, we noticed a buffet setup (for lunch only) in the front dining area and one of the owners explained the menu to us. For only $11.99 (weekdays), it seems like a good deal. I'll have to come back to try it."}
{"text":"Went here for the buffet on Saturday during lunch and there was no meat left (the restaurant was completely empty) Only small pieces of meat here and there. The buffet was cold and not very flavourful. Very overpriced for the quality of food you're getting. Everything seemed defrosted and not to mention service was not good at all. Had to hunt the waiter down to order drinks and naan. I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Decent size place tucked in a small plaza. Went for lunch on Sunday. Good service. Great food. Yummy butter chicken and fresh naan. Can't ask for anything more. Looking forward to a 2nd trip."}
{"text":"Have ordered take out from here several times and I have not been disappointed. Great flavours and the spices are identifiably present. So far I've tried the channa masala, gobi fish masala and the chicken vindaloo. Love it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is good, it has a good selection of dishes. One thing I notice is that it tends to me less heavy on masala than other north indian restaurants. I have tried their a la carte and buffet both. I would prefer the  a la carte over the buffet personally. The paneer lababdar was pretty good! It has has a nice atmosphere and a good setup. ."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to 39 spices.  I ate here based on the recommendation of a friend.  The food was very good, the place was clean, and the service was very good.  They offer both buffet and menu options for lunch.  It is a very large restaurant, and suitable for very large gatherings, or events.  I must eat a gluten free diet.  The waitress consulted with the chef to confirm that my choices would be safe.  I had the triple chicken sizzler which was three types of chicken breast done three different ways.  It was served on a sizzling plate, and I also had the okra.  The chicken was good, and was juicy.  There was mint, tandoori, and zThe okra had hints of mustard and cilantro and two types of onions.  The okra was firm, and the dish was flavourful.  Overall, I was very impressed by their menu.  There were several options on the menu that aren't available at most restaurants that I have been to including Goan and Kashmiri options.  I will be back to try these options.    A definite must try.  ;)"}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience dine in and takeout! Have been here with my friends and family, we are always pleased! Everything is so fresh and delicious. The owner and staff are so kind and helpful. Make sure to try the chicken dum Biryani and the tandoori platter!"}
{"text":"Came here for their dinner on a Tuesday night.  It wasn't busy at all.  The service was pleasant and friendly.  Loved the decor and ambience of the place.    We ordered the pani puri and chat puri for appetizer. For the mains, we ordered Chicken vindaloo, tandoori chicken, eggplant curry and a lamb curry ( can't remember the name).  Loved their garlic and mint naan.  Out of these dishes,  I'd recommend ordering the chat puri, lamb curry and tandoori chicken.   I will definitely come back and try out their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet today after seeing good reviews here on yelp and driving past it so often, I was so excited to finally try it! I was left thoroughly disappointed.  They had a buffet table with a selection of meats curries, and vegetable curries, rice, julabmuns, some salad and sauces (raita etc) they also serve you fresh naan, the best part of my meal. The curries were alright, nothing special. The 39 spices special chicken was good, flavourful and mildly spiced. The butter chicken was really sweet which I am now used to when I visit white washed Indian restaurants... not a good quality in butter chicken. The thing that dissapointed me most: the rice, it was very dry and slightly crunchy, even when I drowned it in curry or raita it was hard to swallow. I tried to see if i could end the meal on a sweet note with some julabjamuns and was let down again, it tasted kind of funky...unlike any I've tried before. I barely finished a single plate of food... just paid the bill and cut my losses."}
{"text":"Excellent. For a Buffett, the food was fresh and so was the naan. When we arrived no one was here even though it was after 1pm. The naan bread was made fresh as we sat down to eat. Decor was simple and comfortable.  Thoroughly enjoyed it. Would come again."}
{"text":"We had 39 Spices delivered through Skip the Dishes. We were craving butter chicken and decided to try a new place. I'm so glad we decided on 39 Spices.   We ordered an order of Butter Chicken and some plain Naan on the side.   The butter chicken is all white meat in probably he beat sauce I have had yet. It was lighter than what I am used to and it had a nice vibrant flavour. It was almost like it had a lemon zing to it. It was sliced just right. Not too hot not mild. Enough to make you keep dipping your naan in the creamy sauce!  The naan's were great. Huge in size and nice and soft and fresh baked.   We will definitely order again and hopefully we can go to the restaurant soon and have a nice sit down experience."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious and affordable. Make sure to order the lamb chops if you visit this restaurant! The customer service is great and the restaurant is always clean!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a few birthdays and an early Mother's Day.  After reading some reviews decided to give this place a shot.  First impressions of this place is that the decor was quite tacky, and the way the restaurant was laid out was odd. They do have a patio, which I guess would be nice in summer.  The staff at this place was very friendly and for the most part did their job, although sometimes we found ourselves waiting quite a bit for service. They really didn't recommend any dishes.. that would have been helpful  On that note, I did notice the \"Manager/Owner\" was making his rounds talking to customers, but for some reason he didn't talk to our table even though he was right next to ours? Not sure what that was about...  Anyways we all wanna know about the food..right.?  Overall the food was good, I have tasted better. We ordered fish pakora, Harabhara Kababs for apps. This was good. Main course consisted of : Malai Chicken Tikka (very good), Palak Panner ( good), Lamb Vindaloo ( very good), Goat Dum Biryani ( good)..too many bones.  Overall the experience was okay, I probably would give other Indian restaurants in Markham a taste, before I come back here."}
{"text":"From the eclectic decor to the friendly and attentive staff...this place was charming and went beyond my expectations!!!  From 30ft away u can smell the aroma of spices which makes this place live up to its name.   Went with a friend, and we share a delicious meal of veg platter with 2 chutneys, Chicken biryani which comes covered in a baked naan covered bowl, Baingan (eggplant), and butter naan.   I wish there was room left for dessert and chai, perhaps next time   Ordered takeout: Butter chicken with naan the chicken tasted amazing also!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on lunch buffet experience.  Indian food usually is good in a buffet format. But 39 Spices' version has room for improvement. There were over 10 customers while I was having lunch but the buffet for hot food area looked empty. Most of the serving trays where not even 1/2 full and the food was lurk warm. The reason a lot of people likes the buffet experience because they can see all these food they can eat. But here I felt like more what food left at the end of the day?! And it was only around 1 pm then.  0.5 star for the freshly made naan bread which I really enjoyed. It was prepared when ordered and hot to touch!   Maybe coming here having a real dinner with food prepared when ordered would be a better experience? I would not be back for their lunch buffet but dinner is a maybe."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Main Street Markham. They offer lunch buffet 7 days/week. On weekends, it's  $12.99. Buffet selection is smaller than other places but quality of food is decent. I don't mind the small selection as I always end up eating the same main dishes anyways. They have one table for meat dishes and one table for vegetarian dishes.   The butter chicken, goat curry and tandoori chicken are quite good. I like the eggplant dishes  saut√©ed in onion (can't remember the name). I find the food here is less salty than some other Indian buffet places which is nice.   One down side is the dessert selection is very small, close to non-existent.   Overall, good value for  $12.99 lunch buffet, friend staff and decent food"}
