{"text":"After a few weeks of being open, I thought they would have gotten into the groove of operations since the Blue Fig is part of a chain. Sadly, things still aren't working out well for them.

The customer service was great, they did what they could to make the experience enjoyable; but the wait for food was long, and not worth it. I had the \"lobster macaroni special,\" which was more like overcooked pasta with bland shrimp in a sauce of kraft cheese mixed with faux-crab meat and its packing water. Friends got a bland shrimp alfredo and the best meal of the table: margharita pizza (still just cheese and spinach on somewhat tasty pizza dough), with a little oregano and tomatos+salt it would have been worth eating.

The lobster mac came off of the bill but with a round of drinks and an iced tea the meal was still $45, don't bother."}

Service was TERRIBLE.  My partner and I arrived at around 8:30 PM and left around 10:00 PM...without eating.  Our beers were served without the proper garnish and when we asked for an orange slice, the server brought sliced up orange wedges in a bowl (about 10 minutes later).  Eventually, we ordered some nachos.  They came out kind of slow, but they did show up.  And they were gross.  Chips out of a bag, olives and peppers out of a can, processed oil \"cheese\" out of a pump.  Disgusting.  Maybe if it cost what it would at the roller rink, I wouldn't complain, but the prices did not justify cheap, processed crap food that was served to our table.

Then we ordered our food, but not after having to locate our server, who had disappeared again.  I ordered a burger and my partner ordered a chicken sandwich - there is absolutely nothing on the menu that is original.  AN HOUR LATER and we still did not have food on the table.  Our server never once came to check on our table and despite the place newly opening, no manager came by or was in sight either.  Only when the bartender overheard me saying our server had disappeared did our server magically show up and tell us that the kitchen had misplaced the ticket and she'd just put in our order.  First of all, I highly doubt the kitchen misplaced anything given how terrible this server was in the first place and it was pretty shady of her to blame her co-workers for what I am fairly confident was her fault.  We were also her ONLY table so there truly was NO excuse for her lack of attention.  Another 15 minutes or so pass and our food finally arrives to go, as requested, because I was sick of sitting in that restaurant for a second longer.  The only thing she comped from the meal was the chicken sandwich, but frankly a lot more should have all been comped for such an error and inexcusable wait time.

Unbelievably bad service on a slow night during their opening days of operation.  Maybe they'll improve - though their menu won't and it's a pretty dull, run of the mill menu - but I sure won't be going back."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble across this place by accident but I am glad I did. The Blue Fig has not been open that long and it is still clean and inviting. The menu boasts some good dishes which I was interested in but could not try due to time constraints. I could only have a few drinks @ $4 each. What a deal!!"}
