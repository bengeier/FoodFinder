{"text":"Great salads and sandwiches a huge variety to pick from.  Everything looks freshand clean as we entered . We went basic today with a tuna hoagie and caesar salad , wife had the soup of the day said it was  very good.  Good prices. Convenient."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always fresh and delious! Staff is very friendly! A must go!! Had the Cobb salad and I would go back again and again !!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. The place was really nice inside and very clean. I ordered the spinach lasagna. It came with a salad and a fresh sesame bread stick. It was delicious!!! Ate every bite. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked really appetizing. Wish I lived a little closer. I highly recommend, and cant wait to return to try one of their sandwiches. Great spot, great prices!"}
{"text":"Love this place! As a Long Islander it makes me feel right at home. Take out or dine in is great. Next party we will cater from here."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best deli/ bistro in the area. The food is always fresh and tasty. The service is great - friendly and fast. We take family and friends at every opportunity. Thanks to Nick and  Jill for consistently great experiences."}
{"text":"Wasn't too thrilled with this place. Very basic and trendy. I can see why people love it but it's just not my style."}
{"text":"This place is the cutest and the people are very friendly. I don't remember our servers name but she was very attentive. I had the Cajun chicken wrap and it was very good. Love these little businesses!"}
{"text":"I like to try something different each time I go there. Everything is always great! Nick the owner and his wife are always warm and friendly. I also had them cater a special event. all my guests were impressed The only thing more you could ask for is dinner hours."}
{"text":"Love this place, from the food to the owners.  Everything is delicious and fresh!!  This is a must eat in Henderson/Green Valley area."}
{"text":"Delicious little deli and friendly staff. Reasonably priced and better than far better than any chain deli"}
{"text":"Love everything I've had here. If you are looking for a yummy sandwich, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"I visit Fanny's every now and then for lunch. They offer delicious deli options amongst run of the mill fast food restaurants in the area. I do love a good sandwich and my favorite here is the club on rye. The potato salad is great as a side. Portions aren't huge (a plus in my book) but you will leave full and satisfied. Service is always friendly.    Ditch Subway and give this mom & pop shop a try!"}
{"text":"A truly magical family owned business. Service is spectacular and the food is amazing! You can come alone or with others. The atmosphere is so chill. I LOVE the chicken cutlet hero and the cares with Basil Mozzarella and tomato. Perfect place."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and outstanding food. A niceclean family-owned bistro.The deli salad is awesome and I eat it often, some days with tuna salad and some days with chicken salad on top. Homemade bread and Boars Head deli-meat, a plus for me. Lots to choose from and clean. I've never taken any of my friends to this place that didn't absolutely love it"}
{"text":"My go to lunch place! Super low-key but don't let the bear-bones location fool you, this place is THE BOMB. I could have their Asian chicken salad everyday. Everything here is amazing, and their brownies are out of this world!"}
{"text":"If you are into small non chain restaurants, this place is for you.  Food is authentic.  Love the chicken cutlet sandwich, quiche, hot hero, and sausage and peppers. Pasta salad is awesome.  Staff is friendly and down to earth. Top it all off the prices are VERY reasonable.  It's in a small strip mall and I drove past this place for years before trying it out. I kick myself for not trying it sooner!!!!"}
{"text":"The tuna melt was amazing!!!!! I normally don't like celery in my tuna.. And I really liked this sandwich. But it turns out it was tiny chopped green apples in the tuna mixture rather than celery!  It gave a great taste with great texture.  The sandwich also came on sourdough bread.....YUM!  You can chose from potato salad or pasta salad as a side. I chose the pasta salad and that too was delicious. I finished my entire meal and only paid seven bucks!  (Minus tip) They also served a tiny brownie bite complimentary at the end of our lunch.  I would definitely come here again!   The only downside is appetizers. I was looking for something like mozzarella sticks. Seems like a place like this would have it but they did not. Oh well!  At least everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now and I have loved each visit. I've had their pasta and club sandwich and both where amazing. My last visit I got brownie as well and that has probably been the best brownie I have ever had.   The prices are very reasonable and if you get the daily specials its definitely a great deal. Overall I am very happy I found this place around the corner from where I work."}
{"text":"Really cool little spot with a family feel. I go the daily special which was rigatoni pasta with peppers and onions, and it was delicious. It came with a house salad and breadstick which were both fresh. Fluffy green lettuce on the salad and the breadstick was warm and perfectly soft. $16 lunch total for 2 people, and when they bring the check they bring little brownie bites! We will definitely be back. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because our server seemed a little grumpy.. maybe he was just having a bad day so I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"Deli specials with super service- Fanny's is family owned and operated with a menu of salads, hot and cold sandwiches, and deli counter items, featuring Boards Head meats. Check the TV screen next to the register for seasonal specials.  The antipasta salad is the perfect portion, with a great house Italian dressing. Also got the Special sandwich, not realizing it was just meats, cheeses, and roasted red peppers on baguette, without the additional lettuce-tomato-onion I was expecting. BF liked it, along with the pasta salad. After your meal, you get a little bite size brownie!  Location is in a business area, and they're unfortunately only open for weekday lunch hours and closed weekends. Service was super personable and attentive throughout, even putting my drink in a takeout cup to take with me! Great spot for the neighborhood, wish my schedule allowed me to visit more often."}
{"text":"I am upping this to 5 stars, I have been here numerous times and the food is always high quality and fresh and the people have always been friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to find a place that does it all when I'm in the mood for Italian. From fresh deli sandwiches to pasta salad and potato salad, you can enjoy an amazing lunch for an amazing price and the sausage and peppers are one of my favorites. I also use this place for many business catering events and everyone raves about it, the Greek salad is a big favorite! The best part is walking in to the smiling owners always enjoying what they do, the amazing and happy chef Chris in back waving hello and the overall atmosphere of a friendly down to earth restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is such a great find in Green Valley. Great quality ingredients and bold flavor. Somewhat of a taste of home on the side. I enjoyed the chicken cutlet hero with pasta salad on the side. It's tremendous! I'd consider using this place to cater as well. Try it out and support a quality small business establishment!"}
{"text":"I love Fanny's.  Great service, friendly staff, and delicious food!  The tuna salad, spinach lasagna, Greek salad - I could go on.... I've never had a meal here that I haven't loved.  The only suggestion (not a complaint) I would have is that the fries could use some improving."}
{"text":"With a sign out front proclaiming to be a deli, I didn't expect to have 5 star service, but little hole-in-the-wall places sometimes can hold secrets you might even keep from close friends. Fanny's? was unfortunately not one of those places.  The interior looked like a typical Italian deli: meat/cheese counter advertising Boar's Head Ham, a metal rack to the right filled with olive oil, olives, tomato sauce, pasta, etc. Small 4 seat tables, it gives a small town family business vibe. The staff were very polite and attentive.  The food: 1-2 stars at best.  I ordered riggotoni with meatballs. The sauce was pretty bland aside from the fresh cheese and the meatballs were like rocks. They tasted as if they were just hamburger formed into balls, frozen, thawed, then heated in a microwave. I seriously had a hard time cutting them with a fork.  The saving grace, (not by much) was the small 1\" square of brownie that was presented by the waiter.  I know real Italians who were born and raised in it's, and this is not Italian food.  There is also no restroom available for guests. I understand size constraints, but this is a let down."}
{"text":"So I just ordered from Fannys via uber eats....I never heard of them, but I just saw them as available under 30 min on uber eats. I ordered the chicken cutlet hero....AND IT'S AMAZING!!!! It wasn't too greasy, but full of flavor. I will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time this week. Excellent service and delicious. He had the special, the meatloaf sandwich, which he said was delicious. I had the hot hero, it was also very good. Since it was our first visit, the waitress gave us a sampling of both the potato salad and macaroni salad as our side. Both were very good. Such a homey place and everyone seemed to know each other. We will be returning on our next visit to Vegas. Best service we've had in any restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Had Fanny's cater an event this holiday season and it was the best choice I could have made. The staff is so friendly and helpful. The food not only tasted amazing but looked gorgeous. All my guest couldn't stop complimenting me on the catering and all the credit goes to Fanny's Bistro & Deli"}
{"text":"cute mom and pop family owned deli .. i had the meatball hero which was delicious. . And everything tasted fresh and home made .. the macaroni and potatoe salad was really good .. the staff is very friendly and check up on you regularly. ."}
{"text":"Nice people, nice place, good food.  A little stale smoke smell from the bar."}
{"text":"Best ever quiche, just like custard. Can't wait to go back and they finish every meal with a brownie bite. Which is really unfair because they are so delicious, yikes! Ham and cheese or spinach, amazing..."}
{"text":"All the sandwiches taste the same to me which is strange. Unlikely I'll go back. If you're in the area and are looking for a quick bite this place is fine other than that... keep on moving."}
{"text":"Good customer service fast too even when busy....  quick and tasty  corn beef hot on rye with swiss  50/50 potato salad and mac  And the cannoli was amazing"}
{"text":"I simply love the food here ! There's nothing I've ordered that isn't delicious and so fresh . Staff is super friendly and so nice . Lately I've been ordering the tuna melt ! Yummmy ! Every time I come in , only the best customer service! Good vibes ! Excellent food !"}
{"text":"Fanny's has some BOMB food and Bomb service. Actually everything about them is BOMB. (I'm using the word bomb because I'm currently obsessed with Bomb Pops.)  Mom & Pop locally owned sandwich shop/deli doing everything right from the minute you walk in to the second you walk out the door.  Walk in, sit down. Boom. The menu is on the table waiting for your hungry eyes. If you are smart you will order the Soup of the Day. My favorite is the homemade Chicken Noodle Soup. A cup is $2.99. My favorite sandwich is the California Club which has Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Tomato, Swiss Cheese and Mayo. I always substitute the Swiss for Cheddar. You get your choice of bread for every sandwich. They have Rye, Sourdough, White, Wheat, Baguettes and Hoagies for you to choose from. The sliced breads which are INSANELY DELICIOUS are from Bon Bread Bakery. The hoagies and baguettes are from Great Buns and y'all already know how much love I have for that place. I go with the Rye toasted. It's sandwich perfection. Meats are Boar's Head and with that good bread this is a win-win situation for me every time. Sides are homemade Pasta Salad which I love or homemade Potato Salad which I haven't had yet. I also have to add I am in love with their strong Brawny style napkins.   The food alone is worth five stars to me, but throw in friendly, fast service and they fall under Henderson All-Stars to me. Jill is the owner/waitress and you can tell she's been doing this for a white hot minute. She does the extra things such as putting your check face down to pay when you are ready. She also OFFERS you a To Go cup of your beverage without you even having to ask. Who does that? Jill the greatest waitress ever. That's who.  Overall I am always, always impressed and satisfied when dining at Fanny's. If you ever happen to be in the neighborhood at the right time (Mon-Fri. 10-5p I think) make sure to stop in here for a bite. You won't regret it. Unless you are a weak person with no soul. Then you might regret it."}
{"text":"I love fannys. I have been coming here for years. I love their quiche and pasta salad. My husband always gets the beef dip and it is always good. I Tried the cajun wrap and I was a little disapointed. There was hardly anything in it about 6 little cubes of chicken on each side and not even very much lettuce. I think ill stick to my usual the next time."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time today. What a classy place! The food was fresh and delicious. The simple menu allows the food to shine. The service was top notch. Everyone that we encountered was friendly. I loved that the customers all seemed to be regulars. It had a great homey vibe. The service was quick. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent deli - everything is fresh and homemade. Delicious! And the service was fast and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I Love Fannys Bistro there sandwiches & soups are really so good. This place is so cute it reminds me of a diner from the east coast I had the chicken cutlet sandwich with roasted peppers & cheese There bread was pretty good & I can't wait to try there Italian sandwiches next! They have different kinds of breads to choose from as well With a side of potato salad & the brownies Oh man Yummy! I would definitely try it again & Don't forget there Cookies!"}
{"text":"I have to say I love this place and the people who work there . Jill and her family make it feel like your going to your family's house for lunch or dinner , also the food is amazing ... Best chicken cutlet sandwiches in town !! Have been coming here since a co-worker turned me on to it and plan on coming here and trying new things .."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, the place is small but had a great personal feeling.   Was immediately greeted and sat. They have a great simple menu that isn't overwhelming.  I ordered the Chicken Cutlet Hero. 10/10!  Definitely worth a visit.  I even got a free brownie with the check, forget subway and all those other guys."}
{"text":"It's a small deli but it has that great mom - and -pop feel to it. Service was excellent. Informative and helpful with my menu choice. They have quiche and lasagna which I will have to try the next time I come. I will definitely come back. I ordered the Italian Hero and potato salad as my side. It was delicious. You've got to try this place out."}
{"text":"This place has Boar's head sandwiches!  It is super clean and fast.  At first I thought it was odd that they waited tables inside the small deli but it made it more relaxing and efficient.  Look for Emanuel!  Any Western NY natives need to stop by.    Coffee is fantastic.  They let me change out the bread on my hot sandwich but all of the sandwiches and salads are good as is.  Highly recommend trying the ham and cheese."}
{"text":"Rarely are we in this area of town. Grabbed lunch here while waiting for a repair to be finished at a nearby shop. Very tasty sandwich of beef and sweet peppers for my husband and I had a flavorful wrap, daily special of buffalo chicken. Only complaint was that it was a bit too dry, I a a sauce lover on everything. Lovely touch of a brownie bite as a desert, just enough to taste but not feel guilty about. So much better tasting and value than any of the chains. Nice service, too."}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about this place so I decided to give it a try. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. I had the quiche and it tasted like it was made the previous day. It seemed like it was just reheated in the microwave as the the crust was soggy and the texture of the eggs was rubbery.  The side salad was delicious. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I've heard you can't go wrong with their chicken Parmesan sandwich.  I will go back and  try that next time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have to say it awesome. Everything just tastes so fresh and I'm constantly saying \"this is good!\" while I eat. Today I had \"The Special\" and loved everything about it. I have no complaints about their pasta salad -- so good! I've had their hot ham and cheese sandwich as well and it is also good. It is a small place with a family-run vibe. My dining partner loved the homemade soups, too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and for a great price. I really recommend Fanny's Bistro and Deli to all"}
{"text":"I met my friend, the sister I wish I would have had, homegirl Jaime W. here for lunch after listening to her rave about how great the food was. I am SO glad I did, Fanny's is a gem of a bistro.  The menu had a ton of yummy sounding items on it, I ended  up deciding on the Chicken Waldorf  on a baguette. DELISH! The side of potato salad was also excellent, love the use of red potatoes and carrots.   The super sweet waitress gave us each a chunk of a decadent brownie to sample. It was so good, I had to buy one. As we were walking out to our cars, another employee stuck his head out the door to thank us for coming in. Service is exceptionally friendly here.   The only reason I am not giving Fanny's Bistro & Deli a full 5 stars is they are only open Monday through Fridays... I'd be hitting this gem of a place up regularly on weekends, if I could!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my hubby, his friend,  and my baby girl. Staff is so welcoming from the second u walk in! Service is great! U can tell there are many return customers by the way the diners interact with the staff- like they are all old friends. Staff really knows their customers. Food is soooo filling and tastes like the best homemade sandwhiches I've ever had! Brownies are a must! I go there for my lumch breaks when i have time, i work right across the street. I've gotten my staff to all go over there, too!!! Manny is the funniest and friendliest! Repeat patron, for sure!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in because I was near by and starving ! This little hole in the wall place is amazing . I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Why didn't I know about this place sooner omg!!! I lived right next to here and never went and now I moved and I travel to Fanny's Bistro because it's so damn good! I get the chicken noodle soup minus the noodles and it's delicious. I also always ask if it's possible for me to get the Winter Salad it was an amazing special they had that I keep going back for. Tastes like Thanksgiving in a salad. Family accommodating, great prices. I recommend"}
{"text":"Nick & Jill.......What can I say the service & food beyond stiller. My staff & I eat here once a week as you know. Why because your food selection has something for everyone. Every item very tasty!!! The desserts are a crowd favorite! This cafe has the warm & home town feeling that can't be denied. You have catered business lunches & parties all to turn out with outstanding success!! Your digital signage also worth mentioning as your daughter does all the input through Zem Media!!! Great job all around!!!"}
{"text":"I kept seeing this place on yelp and we finally got to go. My fiance and I had a terrible experience last night at a sushi restaurant so this was nice.   It's small there's only about 5 tables but it's not uncomfortable or clustered. The music is just loud enough to not be intrusive but makes it nice. The service was prompt,  the sandwich was amazing,  the place was clean,  and they offered us a small free brownie. Why? Just because!   Great place for lunch. Will def be coming back."}
{"text":"Staff was very pleasant.  It was like being back east at a deli in NY, really gave you that Moonstruck movie feeling!!  I do want to go back and eat dinner there.  My visit was just for a sandwich to go though. If you're a bread lover, you will enjoy the freshness.  The condiments gave it a good flavor, but there really was hardly any meat.  Almost $11.00 out the door, I don't think I will go back for a sandwich."}
{"text":"#1 favorite place to eat. The service is impeccable the food is amazing everything on the menu gets 5 stars!!! Every time I enter I am remember and greeted with a warm smile. They genuinely care and it shows in service and in their food. Thank you Fanny's for being amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick cheesesteak sandwich and read the reviews here about Fannys.  Wow, I was shocked. The cheesesteak was fresh, hot and no freezer burn like many others in town.  They made it special for me as I don't like peppers and love raw onions. The sandwich was dead on!  Based on the reviews, I tried a brownie as well. WOW! This brownie was moist all the way through. Just the right amount of nuts too.  I like this place a lot and recommend it. I will be back"}
{"text":"All I can say is try the place once and you will be hooked.  Prices are reasonable, I mean why would you go to some fast food chain when you can have a lunch like this.  Everybody is always so friendly and they keep the place spotless.My favorite item on the menu is the chicken cutlet, but everything is good.  Something as simple as a BLT was the best I have ever had.  A must go, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, where should I start?   I guess I can start with the great service you get at this small but wonderful restaurant. My boyfriend and I love going there for lunch since it's near work and their food is great. We arrive and the waitress knows exactly what we're drinking and makes sure our glasses are never empty. Oh how I love personalized service!  I've had several of their soups and sandwiches and have never been disappointed. Their Chicken Cutlet Hero is so good! You have to make sure to get a side of their marinara sauce to dip it in. I also love their Chicken on a Baguette special. I always add avocado to this sandwich to make it even better. If you go, make sure to try both their potato salad and their pasta salad. They are both delicious! My boyfriend and I disagree on which of the two is better.  You must try Fanny's if you find yourself in the Henderson area. I have yet to find another place like it in town. It's a true gem!"}
{"text":"My first review awesome little place great for a deli / Bistro / Italian restaurant. All the food is made fresh daily and delicious. I will be back many times in the future."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but they haven't missed a beat.  I had a tuna sandwich that is still amazing and my wife had a turkey sandwich that she loved.  Besides the food, they always greet you with a smile and even remembered me from a few years back...  Need to keep this place in the rotation!"}
{"text":"My weekly lunch with group of buddies at different restaurants, cafes in the Henderson area.  So I've just moved here but some of these guys have lived here for a decade or two or three.  Joe is a regular here.  I just moved here, live in Summerlin area but I'll definitely be returning as the traffic is nothing in Vegas compared to the SF Bay Area.  I ordered the meatball sandwich based on other reviews and pics. Sweet sauce, the type an Italian grandma would make. Meatballs were delicious. Soft bun.  My buddy had the lasagna so did another guy. First time visit for both, the entire table wants to return.  To the owner who knows Joe, sorry I forgot your name...I wanted to give you 5 stars. Great menu, service, intimate good sized deli.  It's a gem and you know it!!"}
{"text":"Yet another find due to my yelping.  There is a shoe repair place I've been to in the same shopping center, but never stopped at Fanny's, which I now regret.  I had the chicken cutlet sandwich and added peppers.  You get a side, choice of either potato salad or macaroni salad.  I chose potato salad.  This had more body than potato salad typically does, and the addition of carrots provided a welcome crunch.  Additionally, you get a good sized serving, most places give you 3 bites when they offer something on the side.    The sandwich was stuffed FULL.  The bread was strong enough to stand up to up to the cheese, chicken and peppers.  The chicken cutlet is a little thicker than you usually see in a sandwich like this.  I liked this change.  Also, they stack it, so it's doubly thick on the bread, which gives you bites full of chicken.  Another departure from the usual was the breading at Fanny's, which has herbs in it.  Gives an excellent flavor with the crunch from the crust.    I also tried a meatball on the side, which is $1.50 and well worth it.  Again, excellent flavor, and moist in the center.  She included extra red sauce for me so I could dip my sandwich, and it was an excellent pairing.  While the sandwich certainly can stand on its own, I recommend getting the sauce, it really complements it well.  A great flavorful classic red sauce.  Friendly service and a clean restaurant.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great quality and home cooked food. Definitely recommend. The service is awesome and you can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu!"}
{"text":"First I have to say I have driven past Fanny's for as long as I can remember. Today I had to get some key's made for work and when I finished I was right next door so I finally went in after all this time. I was glad I did. The waitress was very nice and helpful went over the specialties on the menu and when I told her I would have to bring my daughter in to try their tuna she immediately brought me a sample to try.  I got my order in less than 5 minutes! Amazing!!! I ordered the California Club it comes with a side of pasta salad or potato salad.  I got the pasta and I expected the regular old boring side the I usually toss out. Instead I got a wonderful fresh and delicious salad. The sandwich was very very good! This place was an unexpected gem!! I love it and will definitely come back with my family!"}
{"text":"The person that answers the phone and takes the orders (presumably the owner I am told) has the worst customer service skills.  The last 3 times we have ordered lunch she has been short and just rude.  While the food is always great the customer service is the reason we will not be ordering again.  That is unfortunate because I love the chicken salad.  To the owner - when someone calls please be courteous and polite in the future."}
{"text":"Got the chicken Philly it's pretty good but had to pay a additional $1 for fries which I thought was considered a side.  Wow!!!"}
{"text":"This place gets the extra star for service. You can tell that they are trying REALLY hard to make a go of it. The decor is pretty Spartan, but the food is good. I had \"The Special:\" salami, prosciutto, roasted peppers, Provolone, with Italian dressing on rye. It was just the right amount -- not some sloppy ginormous sandwich. I also had a decent potato salad. Warning -- the Sammy had some serious garlic."}
{"text":"Decent deli w/good food and service.  Gr8 daily specials.  Not a lot of seating but big menu from a little location.  I like the deli's meat and cheese selections.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Been hearing about this joint food soo good had had the chicken philly, clam chowder soup and they even brought out meatballs *note potatoe sald Killer!"}
{"text":"It's DELICIOUS! Just ate there today and it was a super quick and awesome meal.  Old school new York deli style.  I recommend the chicken cutlet hero. Also the woman who took my order was so sweet:) I grabbed menus to take to my clients in the area and will be recommending them for luncheons."}
{"text":"Ordered the Albacore White Tuna with Pasta Salad, it was amazing and I would recommend it to anybody!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I just went here for the first of what will be many times and it was amazing! I got \"The Special\" sandwich and its so yummy, the potato salad is great, and the cannoli was to die for!!  Plus the biggest bonus was the service. Smiling faces, friendly people, and it was super quick.  Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. Once I ordered to go and this past Friday I had delivery. Well my first experience wasn't that awesome. Maybe I expect way too much. This place was praised by a friend so I was ready for palate explosions.   I ordered the spinach lasagna, tune sandwich, chicken sandwich and both the potato salad and pasta salad.  No to both the potato and pasta salad. Possibly the worst I've ever had. Sad that they are the only sides to everything you order. The tuna was okay. It had a dime size piece of avocado in it, smashed dead center of the slice to give the appearance of a nice piece of avocado on your sandwich. Quite tacky..   The spinach lasagna was basic. Taste like jar pasta sauce.  Friday I ordered a BLT wrap with no Bacon. It was delicious. It was very cool and refreshing. The vegetables were crisp and fresh. I gobbled it down as if it was my last meal.. Well there it is. I guess a \"veggie\" wrap is a no brainier.  4 stars I wouldn't go out of my way to return"}
{"text":"Husband and I tried Fanny's for the first time today for lunch.  I had questions about a few sandwiches and was offered a sample of the tuna and wasn't expecting to like it with green apples in it but it was delicious.  I chose the Albacore tuna sandwich and husband chose the chicken cutlet and he enjoyed his as well.  Service was wonderful and very attentive.  Resturant was very clean and really cute.  Brownie bites were a delicious and nice end of meal touch...we will be back again!  Thank you for a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Have loved this place through two owners.  Family business, delicious food prepared fresh.  My favorites are the tuna melt and the Greek salads."}
