{"text":"The service is fantastic. Everything was cooked perfectly with fresh ingredients. Meals also come with bread, prosciutto and fresh cheese. Try a caesar salad with fresh bacon and potatoes."}
{"text":"Friends took us there the other night. They remembered it as a nice place. Soon as we went in I had that bad feeling--you know, empty restaurant, clean enough I guess, but somehow faintly seedy. We were served by a guy I took to be the owner. He was friendly and polite enough sure, and the food was just passable,but nothing special that's for sure and far from worth the rip-off bill of 240.00 for the four of us. Included in the bill was a bottle of Australian Merlot, around 12.95 in the LCBO. We paid 45.00. There's no wine list, so we might have guessed. No way can I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was better than what I expected. First time to try summerliscou dinner here.   Nice and cozy place , will come next time! Highly  recommend !"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday for Summerlicious menu by reservation. Tomato and goat cheese salad was the starter with salmon for main dish and strawberry cheesecake for dessert. A gentleman which I believe was the owner was serving us and it was a small and cozy place. I really liked the personal attention and service. Food was very good. The strawberry cheesecake was too sweet with the jam on top. I don't recommend that. overall very good for $18 lunch."}
{"text":"The old man who runs this place is just the sweetest. Winterlicious meal options were good and definitely worth $25. Generous wine pouring. Very small and quaint. Good for a date or dinner with a friend, maybe a little small for large groups although you'd probably get the place to yourself! Solid option in the Etobicoke area."}
{"text":"Checked out Santa Monica for Summerlicious.  Appetizers were nice; Vichyssoise was good, bocconcini and tomato should have had better tomatoes as they were quite pulpy. Dinners ordered were shrimp/ mussel linguine and pork with vegetables. Good presentation for the pork with apple, pineapple, red pepper and grilled potatoes.  Shrimp/mussel linguine had a wine/ garlic sauce . No additional vegetables were served with the linguine so it was not very filling, but as it is Summerlicious I guess they had to skip on something.  Dessert was not memorable or as listed.  Service was skimpy and not attentive, but restaurant was quite full and only holds 20 people so perhaps some staff were missing. No wine was offered even when requested, no water refill, no coffee offered. Not a good choice unless you are a larger group, i.e more than 2!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with a white table cloth setting. The waiter/host/possible owner was an older gentlemen in jeans and sneakers who served the whole place.  We came for winterlicious and was surprised that the food was delicious and portions weren't stingy.   Luckily we made reservations ahead of time because walk-ins were turned away due to lack of space.  4.5/5 for food - the appetizer and tartufo wasn't the best but everything else was very appetizing   3.5/5 for service - the waiters hands were very dirty and kept pulling up his jean pants. We waited awhile to get his attention as he was turned around watching the television quite a bit.   4/5 for decor/space"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, slow service and lack of ambiance is how I would describe this restaurant. We had a Winterlicious reservation for a group of six, and I thought that two hours would be more than enough time to finish and be able to get to my plans after.  It took almost half an hour for our orders to even be taken, more than an hour for entrees to come out, had to flag someone down to fill out empty water glasses, and so on. I got the escargot for my app and the wild boar ragout for my main, both were very average. After the entree I asked if I could get my cheque with dessert as I was in a rush, and it took another half an hour for them to bring out a store-bought piece of chocolate cake, without my cheque. It looked like it was just a father son duo serving everyone and all the other tables of smaller groups were getting served well before us, so not sure if they are just not good with groups?  I had to go up to the counter and ask for my cheque, and it took another 15 minutes for them to actually process my payment. There was a miscommunication in this as well, as everything says a 17% gratuity is added on for groups of six or more, but he did not add on for me and was distraught when I did not add any tip as I thought it was already included. Unfortunately I didn't have any change and didn't have another 15 minutes for them to process another transaction, so had to leave at that. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Five of us went to Santa Monica for Winterlicious....they didn't disappoint. The offering is super, including a wide choice of entries. The lamb shank and salmon were particular favorites but the appetizers and dessert ....crepes were also very excellent.  This is a smaller quaint place, not too fancy, but very comfortable and the owner is always overseeing things to make sure everyone is taken care of.  We will definitely be back."}
