{"text":"Great service! Our driver forgot a can of pop and came back to drop off later in the eve! The wings were amazing!"}
{"text":"Every time they come in to make a delivery they scatter to-go menus literally all over the floors. On the elevator floor and all over the hallways. So on top of their pizza being terrible they are ghetto enough to make a mess of other people's (nice) property. I've called three different times to complain and I always get the same older Indian guy with a heavy accent who tries to talk smack to me when I tell him it's not cool for his drivers to come in and leave messes behind. He also refuses to let me talk to a manager or give up the manager's name, so I'm assuming he IS the manager or the owner and is being avoidant. Lame."}
{"text":"Do not listen to any of the reviews on here. This is the most disgusting DIRTY and gross place i've EVER eaten at. As soon as I walked in I wanted to walk out. But i was starving so i gave it a shot. The pizza is some of the worst i've seen ever.

 If you want decent greasy pizza go to Pizza GiGi's or North of Brooklyn Pizza.

Took 30 mins to get my food, on top of it being horrible.  If I could give it NEGATIVE stars i would."}
{"text":"This pizza was burnt with no sauce. The garlic bread managed to be burnt and not cooked on top. Wings were bad. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"After waiting an hour and a half for delivery, I had the opportunity to eat the worst pizza in my lifetime!
The pizza barely had any cheese and toppings on it and was really over cooked. 
I genuinely would prefer a pizza out of the frozen section from the grocery store than pizza from here.
I highly DO NOT recommend!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only pizza place remotely close to the Junction with late-night delivery that gives you your fill for a reasonable price. I'm not saying the food is excellent or even good- it just does it's job. For less than 30 bucks you can get enough pizza, wings, garlic bread, wedges and pop to feed 4 grown adults. Comparable pizza delivery combos come out to at least 20-25 dollars more for similar options- so this place kills it every time.
Don't expect exceptional food, but expect to have your hunger keele'd"}
{"text":"So where do I start? Huh Huh Huh!? My son can make better pizza than this place. Must be owned by that broke Tabaz guy."}
{"text":"We got a flyer advertising this place at our home and decided to give it a try. We always try to support local self owned businesses. 

I'm not sure what the crappy reviews are all about because our last two delivery orders were quick and the food was great. Their pizza is really good in my opinion. I eat pizza really weird (I break it down piece by piece) and this pizza from their toppings to their cheese and their crust...it was yummy. 

Their wings are unique. They look like chicken lollipops (which I've had at a very expensive restaurant before) and their wing sauce is yummy too. We always get ours on the side. Their medium sauce only had a small kick to them so if you want spicy go hot or super hot. 

Their garlic bread and fries are good enough for the price we paid. Not a huge fan of the fries but they're still edible. 

Also I found it cute that the flyer had a small pic of the owner and when I've called, I believe it's actually him who takes my order and he's really sweet. His hearing isn't the greatest so you have to speak up."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. As far as those small independent pizza joints go this place ain't half bad. The pizza is reasonably priced, the wings are pretty good, the delivery is usually nice and quick and you can get stuffed crust, which hey, who doesn't want a better way to get fat, amirite? This is by no means your gourmet pizza that comes from a wood burning stone oven and is topped with exotic ingredients, but when you're craving some of that good, greasy deliciousness in a pie, delivered and for a reasonable price, I recommend you call these guys"}
{"text":"Pro: Open late with food.
Cons: Shitty service, counter guy made me feel like I'm bothering him for ordering pizza.  Taste gross the next day (I love pizza leftover the next morning). 

Would not go back, I rather starve. 

It's too bad, I love to support the independent guys in the neighbour but the grumpiness and lack of service is just too appalling for me to support.

Gave it two starts for it's corniness with the name and distance to home.  That's all."}
