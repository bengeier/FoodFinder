{"text":"It's an alright location if you just want a small portion of pre-cooked hotpot.  Currently they have a 15% off promotion as they are newly opened. We were also offered a free bubble tea each on that day.  Came on a Thursday around 7pm. The restaurant was pretty empty, around 5 or 6 tables seated. This is probably because they are newly opened and most people don't eat hot pot in the summer.  I ordered the curry pot, my boyfriend ordered the lamb hotpot and a side of stinky tofu. Everything came pre-cooked which isn't my favourite. The pots are heated using gel fuels. This means that the pot is not boiling. It only keeps the pot hot... but not boiling. This is not a good idea when you ordered additional sides to put in as nothing is boiling. The tops of the fish balls were hard and lukewarm at best. There were sauces on the side for you to dip much like hot pot.   They advertise this as Taiwanese hot pot but that is an issue when your pot doesn't boil...  After the 15% off and a free bubble tea, the meal came to roughly $40 for the two of us. I am happy with this price for what I got, but probably wouldn't come here when it is full price.  Fullness level: 10/10. A good amount of food (I was super full, BF was okay) Price vs. Satisfaction: 7/10.  We had 15% off and a free drink. Atmosphere: 8/10. Clean place, comfy seats. Food Quality: 5/10. We did not like the pre-cooked, lukewarm food Service: 9/10. The staff were quite nice and attentive."}
{"text":"After seeing an Instagram post about the grand opening, I decided to try this place with my s/o as we both love hot pot and can no longer justify AYCE places. The place itself is situated at Times Square and is a fairly big location with ample seating. Decor wise it was nothing special and there isn't much to say about it.  Food (2/5) Similar to all the other mini hot-pot restaurants, you order based on the soup base and it comes with a range of preset food items ranging from meat and veggies. We ordered the kimchi dumpling hot soup and Thai flavour hot soup. The soup flavours were lacking, bland, and wasn't spicy at all. There was A touch of spiciness but seemed to be added as an afterthought. My kimchi soup had so little kimchi that finding a piece was like striking gold in a mine. The ingredients inside were nothing special and was the same as every other mini hot pot place.  Service (2.5/5) As per usual I never expect over the top service at Asian establishments... On that particular weeknight there were four servers but it seemed like each one was designated to one task and weren't allowed to do anything else. We would wave down a server to order, make eye contact with them, have them nod but then they would then walk away because they were busking a table. Even if the staff was designated to a task they should've notified their coworker.  Overall I don't force myself coming back as the soup bases weren't good at all. To be honest we came because we saw a promotional ad on Instagram but when it came to pay were told it had ended the day before. They advised us of their rewards program but the price and taste is just not worth going back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a hot pot fix when we stumbled upon this new hot pot place in Times Square. Be aware that there is a similarly named restaurant named Taste Pot in the same plaza across from this place.  So the minute we sat down we were greeted by a nice server. I got the beef soup for the base and my SO got lamb. The broth for both soups were very good. I'm a guy and I feel the portion was a bit lacking. They do provide a lot of veggies but the meat and noodle were on the lesser side. You can add more but there's a charge, so don't mistaken this for AYCE hot pot.   The bubble tea was surprisingly really good. They give you a nice reusable container too.   Service was good. No wifi. Parking can be busy since there are restaurants all over the same plaza.   Overall it was good food. I like how the hot pot was already pre-cooked so it took the guess work out of hot pot cooking. This makes for a good lunch spot since it's not heavy portions. Will be back again whenever I crave good hot pot."}
{"text":"Delicious, this store just open today. I believe it is a chain from California. Got the Taiwanese supreme spicy soup. Unbelievable flavor and spicy."}
{"text":"Moving back to Toronto I really missed Boiling Point. This chain is very similar to it and even offers more options. Excellent authentic Taiwanese hot pot. The prices are not too bad either."}
{"text":"This Taiwanese hot pot joint just opened recently.  Currently they are doing a 15% off as their grand opening special.  Without the 15% discount, I would think the food is a bit pricy for my wallet.  We had lunch there and I ordered a cheese pot which came recommended.  It did not disappoint and the portions were decent.  It was $14.99 which came with either a green or black tea.  The presentation of the pots were nice but I found it too large which took up most of the table.  We barely had room for bowls and the sauce dish.  There were 4 varieties of dipping sauce with garlic soy and satay being my favourite.  Staff was attentive and made sure to top up the pots with more soup."}
{"text":"It's a good alternative to the regular hot pot. You kind of eat it the same way. Just take out the food and dip in your mixed sauce. Most people probably don't prefer all you can eat all the time anyway. The portion is good and food is arranged nicely in the pot. The broth is just average, nothing special about it. There's a little fire under the pot to keep it hot and they do add broth to your pot when it start to get low. There's a few special sauces on the table for you to mix your own dipping sauces. They taste great and not your typical store bought sauces. I ordered the melon drink with the milk froth on top, it was overly sweet. Will tell them to add less sugar next time. I give them extra point for the service. Lots of waiters to serve you unlike like most Chinese places. I guess they are Taiwanese, so it's alittle different. I dropped my chopsticks and three different staffs raced to pick it up faster than I can get to it. And I am usually pretty fast. They offer me extra napkins without me asking. And they add broth to the pot automatically without any request. Great service."}
{"text":"yummy! this is a new taiwanese mini hot pot restaurant and it is pretty good. first off, the pots are very pretty and we ordered the beef hot soup and the cheese milk pot or something (1 and 3 on the menu). each pot comes with an assortment of vegetables and meats and noodles/rice. i ate the cheese one and it is very good and i like the flavour but maybe a little more cheese would've been better. i also added the instant noodle but i do not recommend because it takes away the flavour of the soup and it only tastes like instant noodle.  also got a half and half milk tea just ur average milk tea but cute cup   overall i like it the menu is simple and straightforward and it is close to home so i will come back."}
{"text":"Definitely will come back again. I had the stinky tofu and it reminds me of the Boiling point place in US. Their garlic and soybean sauce is highly recommended !!"}
{"text":"Toronto hasn't had an authentic Taiwanese shabu shabu place in ages. There used to be one in Commerce Gate, but it closed down many years ago. *tear*  So a little background on Tasty Pot, it's a chain from the US and this location is their first Canadian outpost. We spoke with the staff and they're planning on opening a few more locations here if their first year is a success (which I suspect it will be).   And a little background on Taiwanese shabu shabu: essentially it's individual hot pot, which means it can be AYCE or pre-set plates of food that you cook yourself, but it's meant to be your own small pot. Sadly most people only know hot pot as the one big pot kind, which as fun as it may be still means you only get to pick 1 or 2 soup bases. Thankfully, with shabu shabu everyone can get different flavours so you can try as many as you want!   I ordered the Stinky Tofu shabu shabu, and my partner ordered the Kimchi Dumpling one. I thought my stinky tofu one could've been much stinkier, but maybe they tamed the flavour because they weren't sure if the average Joe liked it that stinky. The ingredients were fresh.   Overall, the food was quite delicious. They have good dipping sauces, including the Taiwanese classic satay sauce (Bull head brand). But be sure to order the large version for dinner, as I was still hungry after eating the regular. Drinks are quite good too, but expensive at around $5.50 each.  I will defs be coming back, especially since we finally have a good Taiwanese shabu shabu place in TO. Not to discount the Korean or Japanese shabu shabu places, those are good too but just different."}
