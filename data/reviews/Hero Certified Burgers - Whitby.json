{"text":"Didn't like it at all.  The patty on my burger was grey looking and looked like it had been steamed before being given the briefest introduction to the grill.  

Overpriced and pretentious.  

They didnt have wifi.  They told me I should use the wifi from pizza pizza next door"}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic. Very filling. 

Best item on the menu though is the poutine. They use real cheese curds and hot delicious gravy. I highly recommend. 

Restraunt is all ways in a very clean state, but the dining room is very small."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place is still going, I've seen S%&T run through a strainer faster then their service.
For the amount of time you have to wait for your food, its crap"}
{"text":"Very expensive. I had the chicken and the bum was stale and completely soaked. I don't know why it was soaked there was no sauce. I would rather go to McDonalds at least there you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"I saw an ad in the local paper advertising the Grand Opening, coupled with a coupon for a free combo with the purchase of a 6oz burger.  With no further prompting needed, I decided that I had go & check it out for myself.

When I walked in, everything was bright, clean & shiny, which is what you would expect from a place that just opened.  It's decorated nicely, & the tables & chairs are a touch classier than your average burger shack.  What really struck me about the place, though, was how small it was.  I think I only counted 18 seats, & when you take into consideration the people dining by themselves, or two people sitting at a table for four, the place can fill up pretty quickly.  It'd be kind of awkward to approach a stranger sitting there, eating their food & say, \"Mind if I sit down while I wait for them to call my number?\"

Having never been to Hero Burger before, the woman taking my order was more than happy to explain the various choices, including different patty sizes, meat choices, bun & side options, etc.  I decided that I would have to save my coupon for another day, because a 6oz burger just wouldn't cut it today.  So I opted for the 8oz beef patty on their regular egg bun with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles & mayo.  After those friggin' taxes, my combo & side of gravy came to $13.55.

It was at this point that I found the biggest thing that sets this place apart from most other restaurants.  Having been given the empty soda cup for my combo, I went over to the soda fountain & saw that it's a computerized Coca Cola Freestyle fountain that dispenses over 100 different kinds of pop.  It's a really neat machine, & the only problem is when you're stuck in line behind someone who's not very decisive, & tries to sample as many of the 100+ choices as they can before making their ultimate decision.

After eventually getting my drink, I waited an appropriate amount of time for my burger to cook, & eagerly dug in.

When I ordered, I was told that all of their burgers are cooked medium-well, which is fine, as long as they can cook it properly without drying it out.  When I took my first bite of that burger, all my fears dissipated like a taco fart in a windstorm.  It was the most tender, juicy burger I've tasted in a long time.  The meat was seasoned nicely, & as much of a cliche as it sounds, it melted in my mouth.  The toppings & bun were super-fresh & complimented the burger perfectly.

The fries are thicker than shoestring-cut fries, but not as thick as chip truck fries.  They were very good, & the gravy was a step up from your standard packet gravy.  It was richer & had a more authentic \"gravy\" flavour, for lack of a better term.

I devoured every last morsel & loved every bite.  This place might be a tad pricier than other burger joints, but any money here is well-spent.  It's good value, great service & top-quality food.  I'll be back for sure, & I'm already looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time the staff is awesome. I feel I get the same fella all the time and he's a awesome guy! The kitchen staff are always happy and friendly too. They have the best burgers. MMMMM MMMM I love their gluten free buns more then anything else. I wish I could buy them and take them home!!! Food is always the same and always yummy!!! Like their milkshakes too.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was really interested in trying Hero, as was I, so we ended up getting burgers and fries for takeout one night.

I ended up getting a regular burger with cheese, tomato, lettuce, a few sauces, onion and onion strings with fries on the side. These are very big burgers, I don't think i was able to eat the entire thing. Unfortunately, nothing about this burger stood out to me. It wasn't super flavorful and it didn't' have any wow factor about it. The onion strings got lost in the burger because they were placed on the burger first, so all of the other heavy/wet toppings went on top of them. The fries were quite good but not so good to carry the lacklustre nature of the buger.

A good burger but not the best I've had. We were both disappointed and for the price, it's not worth going back for."}
{"text":"The Atmosphere here is pretty cool, everything is brand new, and service is usually pretty good , but best of all they offer gluten free burgers.

As someone with celiac  it's always nice to know you have a place to eat where you are not going to get sick from cross contamination or just laziness on part of the staff. Having visited this location more than a few times now, they definitely deliver in this regard. Also the burger and buns are great!! the buns have this distinct crispy outside, but soft an fluffy inside which is pretty awesome and definitely isn't the case for most gluten free buns.
 

Would highly recommend if you are looking for gluten free options or just a healthy burger option in the whitby area"}
