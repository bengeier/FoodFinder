{"text":"One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot."}
{"text":"The interior could use a little TLC, but the staff is very friendly and the food is way, way above average for a sports bar. The wings here are some of the best I've ever had, and they are always on special during NFL games."}
{"text":"Armadillo grill is usually a place my Coworkers and I like to out out together after work. The spinach dip is great and the servers are nice. Recently, I tried joining them at the bar and had the worst experience, I will not be going back. The bartender was very rude to me and after six times of asking for a menu I had to flag down a server to get any help. It took 2 hours to get an order of wings and I was very unhappy with the service. Armadillo is great if you go during happy our and sit at a table, but I would never recommend going to the bar."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here. The mozza sticks are massive and delicious.  The sliders are cooked perfectly to a medium/medium rare state. They didn't include a sauce, so I added ketchup at home. After that, they were delicious. The saut√©ed onions added a nice flavor to it. I also tried the shrimp from the blackened shrimp Caesar salad and they were orgasmicly good. Full flavored with a slight spicy kick, it's a shame they're only a temporary item on the menu. Nevertheless,  if you see blackened shrimp on the menu, order it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"While the ambiance here is definitely nothing worth writing home about, you can't beat the reverse happy hour. $3.50 food items (hummus, mozzarella sticks, etc) bring me back from time to time. They also have some drink specials, including theme nights where you can get cheap margaritas, etc. Worth going at least once."}
{"text":"Kind of a dive, but friendly and efficient service, and the food is consistently good.  Their fried pickles are surprisingly good. My bf is a huge fan of their salmon dinner."}
{"text":"It's a good place. I was pissed after the girl who was supposedly a manager acted like a teenager but I won't let one employee ruin  place for me forever. I love their chicken wings and they have some other decent finger foods. I really only go for the apps, I feel that's where sports bars tend to shine the most. The only complaint is the beer taste off. It's probably improper tap line cleaning or possibly the co2 is off. It's one of my very few pet peeves and The Dillo isn't the only place guilty of it. If you're going to have the state flagship beer on tap then it needs to taste right. I'd give it 3.5 for sports bars. Decent prices and decent music being pumped out. Half Moon has some better deals on happy hour but good lord I can't stand the ambiance. Dillo is a decent priced neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"An appetizer, 2 HUGE dinners, and beer for 35 bucks.  Yes.  Lots to choose from on the menu.  Good service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, the food taste amazing we have had the beef stroganoff and the white chicken enchiladas among a few other items. We drive all the way from Youngtown to eat there I would defiantly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a bar that serves great restaurant food. The Philly cheesesteak is delicious, fried pickles are just okay and the beers just taste better here"}
{"text":"Went Sunday night with some friends, had some good beer, and some real good munchies.  Fried pickles and mozzarella wedges.  They were both delicious, and half off since it was Sunday night!  Last but not least, the employees were all very kind and courteous, which makes me want to return....It was a good night."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a brew and relax. Great neighborhood feel and always some locals drinking alone at the bar chatting with the bartenders. And I'll tell you what, I love a place where I feel comfortable enough to have a beer by myself without feeling like a raging alcoholic. Very mixed crowd where everyone is welcome. Definitely the right mix of dive bar and neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite spots over the years. Never disappointing. For a \"bar like\" atmosphere the plate ups are ridiculous...and by that I mean AMAZING! You would think you were eating at a 5 star restaurant.  There tomato soup is my absolute favorite!! I highly recommend you don't leave there without trying the fried pickles or the hummus plate...both are THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD! Looooooooove this place."}
{"text":"i really like this restaurant. this is a combo bar & restaurant. THERE IS ALSO OFF TRACK BETTING FOR HORSES!  in the main room is a bar surrounded by tables. i think it looks pretty cool. all the tables have black table cloths and candles. there are multiple tvs for betting or sports.  the food is advertised as ecclectic. the menu is large with a great variety of food. this is not just plain bar food. they have ribs, steaks, calamari, sandwiches, burgers, chicken, pasta, etc....  i think the food is really good. the steaks are great and they give you plenty of quality vegetables for sides. the salads are large and they have a variety of specialty salads. appetizers are priced better then other places. they have a cheap appetizer menu 7 days a week for happy hour. appetizers during happy hour are ONLY $3.00. they have simple appetizers like wings up to really good like calamari. 3.00! they are known for their deep fried pickles which i find good. if you are looking for a more quiet place to sit other then the bar area and tv area, there is a separate dining room. i've never been let down by their tasty food and quality service. you can go here for a good party time, a romantic dinner, or a family dinner. good all around place. they have a smokers patio with misters."}
{"text":"On our qwest to find the ultamet fried pickle ...in the valley we have found the One..And have accomplished our mission... Soo Darn Good the spares Cajun style... Happy Happy Happy!!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff, the food, and the location make this place a great place to enjoy.  The staff goes out of there way to accommodate you.  They have deep fried pickles,  just hope they can get fried green tomato's.  The menu is mixed and filling with flavors.  I highly recommend Armadillo's.  If you dine by yourself or with others this is place to go to.     Jameson's Gold"}
{"text":"Not Bad, not bad!  I will admit I prejudged the place. I didn't expect much. I was even hesitant thinking I might get food poisoning or something. But, I ordered beef kebabs, basically shish kebab with onions and peppers, a bed of mashed potatoes and a mushroom gravy that complimented it extremely well.   The meat was a decent quality and flavored nicely. The gravy and mashed potatoes probably were probably just processed ingredients but were good and had that sort of \"lazy mom's weeknight dinner\" recipe taste to it.  It was slightly underdone on a few pieces which I put to the side and didn't eat but it went together nicely. I was satisfied. I also had 2 drinks a margarita which wasn't great, and a seven and seven which tasted very weak.   The service was pretty great, every time we  walked up to the bar we had someone come up to us pretty fast.  Overall not a bad place and they have a nice patio."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go! They have awesome specials and the best hummus I have ever had, and I order it almost everywhere. Yummy drinks and nice bartenders! Love it."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Great food. Decor could use some help, and the TV's were a bit small to be a sports bar. Food was affordable, and portions were large.  Drinks were as expected, nothing good or bad about it. I had Kiltlifter, my friends had sodas and iced teas.  We ordered some buffalo and honey bbq wings, as well as some calamari. First, the wings were huge, which was good because we only got about 8 for the 1lb order. But they were very well done, and the flavor was not added on post cooking, as most average establishments do. No, the flavor was baked in.   The calamari was not rubbery, but had a good snap, which means it was well cooked and of good quality. The breading wasn't overboard, and had a nice crunch to it. Very well done.  For the entrees, we had the Beef Stroganoff, the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, and I ordered the Mac and Cheese with the Buffalo chicken upgrade.  First, my Mac and Cheese. It definitely wasn't box mac. It had a few cheeses that were  blended and mixed in with penne, and the dollar upgrade of buffalo chicken was a heapful of chicken on top. It came together very well, and tasted great. Well worth it, and the extra for Buffalo chicken. Portion size was also good.  The Beef Stroganoff was well done according to my friend, and it looked huge. Comfort foods should always be generous portions and have a nice home cooked feel to it in order to be successful. They were.  And the Buffalo Chicken sandwich? My friend said it was the biggest one he'd ever gotten. It looked it. And he enjoyed it. So there's that. It didn't look too extravagant, but then it shouldn't be. It just looked big and tasty.  So why four stars? First, the decor was fairly outdated. It looked kind of like a neighborhood bar, but facing Camelback, and being so close to the Biltmore, I really thought they could use an upgrade. The TV's were at best 30's and the audio was low. A sports bar usually has at least a few 50's and pump out the sound for the major games.   But, all this could be why their prices are affordable (just go to Biltmore instead, and overpay for the ambiance), and their food is certainly good enough to keep people coming back. In fact, writing this review, I believe I shall go there again tonight."}
{"text":"My business partner and I love getting wings for lunch. That hunt for great wings led us to Armadillo Grill and has now turned into a weekly occurrence. I still have a place or two in Central Phx that I haven't tried (yet), but Armadillo Grill has hit the best wings in town, IMO. Yes, they are that good. What's even better is they are half price on \"Wing Wednesday\"! I strongly recommend the Armadillo Gold (Medium spicy), followed by the Honey Hot (Mild). Great seasoning on the wings, amazing sauce. Even their Buffalo (hot) is tasty - I just like the Armadillo Gold too much to venture away from it very often.  I have NEVER had a rude experience with the staff. Minimal issues with service or food, that were always fixed right away and with a smile.   As for the atmosphere, you just have to know what you are walking into, and the place is great. What it is NOT: Chic, Upscale, Pretentious. What it IS: Really good food, down to earth, and no frills. It's not a \"Dive\", but it's not Twin Peaks, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Zipps either. It has an OTB (Off Track Betting) so finding half a dozen guys betting the ponies is to be expected. It's a \"Bar and Grill\" - not the worst place for a family, but if you bring kids, make sure you sit in the \"restaurant\" area, not at the tables within ear shot of the bar (that seems kind of logical though).  Thank you Brenda for giving us our regular \"Wing Wednesday\" hang-out!"}
{"text":"Soo good! Spicy chicken pasta, hummus plate and tomato soup. Yep the tomato soup rocked! Love this place, price and quality."}
{"text":"Meh, prime location so I expected better. Typical late night bar food being served in a restaurant. I would had to have been drunk to enjoy the food. Don't waste your time or $"}
{"text":"I had a great experience while eating here the food is fantastic and the staff is great! My friends and I went to the Tuesday night trivia and it was really fun, I also won some cool prizes which was nice."}
{"text":"Was expecting a little bit better given the reviews. I will say that the staff was very friendly.  Philly cheesesteak sliders were good (get them with jalapeno peppers). Buffalo wings just ok.  I was excited about the fried pickles, but they were disappointing.  First, you need to know that they're pickle spears, not slices/chips; I've never seen that before.  Dipping sauce was very thin/runny.  Plenty of beer choices, and the different specials as others have noted are nice.  I'd try another place next time."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is excellent and so is the service. Great hangout if you enjoy OTB."}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorite comfort food places. From the big salads to awesome appetizers, the food is outstanding. Love the hamburgers too.  Now that they are available thru GrubHub, we order even more often!"}
{"text":"This place is half off-track gambling and half-sports bar as evidenced by what is on the TV's as well as the patrons. So for me, on the one hand having to be around the knuckle heads who want to waste vast amounts of time and money on which horse can run fastest is a negative. The dark and dingy interior doesn't help either.    But on the other hand, the food is certainly a cut above the typical greasy, soggy bar food one usually encounters at most sports bars for a decent price. If you're there to watch a whole football game like I would on a few occasions you could end up spending in the mid to high 20's when it's done, but if you're just there to get a meal and maybe a beer, then obviously you won't end up spending as much like around $15. The bartenders are overall ok. No real issue there.  Overall it's more of an interesting experience than a pleasant experience, which is why I will pop in from time to time, but only from time to time just to mix it up.  Oh yeah, and to their credit (at least in my book) they play metal later in the night when all the games are over and there's no more retarded horse racing on."}
{"text":"As we all know, Condor has been to many Pubs in the Queen's Empire, London, Sydney, Dublin, you name it. Yesterday, elbow to elbow at the bar of The Armadillo Grill, among kindred Sportsmen in the Valley betting on the Sport of Kings (Horse racing), at the suggestion of the gorgeous Armadillion Carrie, I tried \"Richard's Pub Burger\" from the Specials Menu. Needless to say, the juicy beef, cheddar cheese and delicately fried egg sandwiched between a crisp, toasted Thomas' English Muffin, rivaled the best Pub Fare in the world. Try it with a cold beer or, as my friend Jimmy said, \"with a Bloody Mary! Breakfast of Champions!\" Now if I could only pick a winner at Turf Paradise!"}
{"text":"My husband and I do like good wings and as we're in Phoenix for a couple of months we looked for somewhere that offered some tasty wings. The Armadillo Grill certainly provided them! The Armadillo Gold and the Honey Hot were absolutely delicious, the asian slaw that came with them was a tasty take on a traditional favorite.  The staff were very pleasant and all in all we had a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars, its a cool relaxed environment. It has a great daily happy hour and reverse happy hour.  I have taken many friends and business clients, they have all wanted to go back.  Great food and drinks.  The wings in the Armadillo gold sauce can be voted Phoenix Best.  Their potato skins are the best I've had (when they don't come out a little burned I must admit).  Can you say Fried Pickles!  Give it a shot, if you like pickles you will love the Fried Pickles.  If you get the burger, you need to get the onion rings!!"}
{"text":"Best tomato soup ever.  Also love, love the smothered chicken."}
{"text":"Probably an ok place to grab a drink and watch some sports but wouldn't recommend you eat there. I ordered the chicken/brie sandwich - sounded lovely on the menu but it was boiled chicken - so rubbery it was tough to cut through. My husband ordered the steak tacos. They were so greasy he couldn't pick them up. We both had bad stomach ache for hours after eating there."}
{"text":"I liked this place! I like the outdoor area where you can sit outside. They have TVs everywhere. Our waitress was super friendly. Fair prices. We ordered the fried pickles for starters (half Cajun half regular) and Oh. Em. Gee. SOoo good! I couldn't decide weather I wanted the pulled pork sandwich or the meatloaf sandwich. I went with pulled pork. Meh. I've had better. Wasn't all that delicious, so kind of a let down. I wish I had just ordered more fried pickles. Lol. But yeah,cool place! I'll be ordering something else next time though."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to hang out, drink a few beers, and eat some serviceable bar food.  The staff is pretty good.  They have good happy hour specials.  The only problem is that is has delusions of grandeur that border on the comical.  They try to hide the fact that it's a complete dive bar by doing things like putting candles and tablecloths on the tables, among other things.  Come on, guys, you're a dive bar, and that's ok.  Just own it."}
{"text":"Great food and the staff is beyond great. Jordan our server, Katie the manager and Brenda the owner were all awesome! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very chill place to watch NCAAF, NFL, and MLB games for sure. Bartenders (forgot their names) are awesome. Dude with the Mohawk is bad ass. The food is delicious and their drink specials are epic. Just a bit of advice to other riders that go here, if you wear gear like I do, don't put it next to you on an empty seat...they don't like that haha. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Tried it with the wife for the first time today at happy hour. Great beer prices, chips and salsa were ok. The problem? It's turned into an OTB bar. No ESPN or Fox Sports playing. Every monitor had race tracks from across the country and cash out machines throughout the establishment. OTB crowd isn't my first choice...not that there's anything wrong with that."}
{"text":"We have been here twice, returning the second time for another platter of thier great Armadillo Gold wings!  I hade the fried fish and it was just OK.   Service was quick and it's easy to find a parking place.  I will be back at least for the wings again."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix! It's perfect for getting good food late at night. Their appetizers are awesome, especially the Armadillo Gold wings and calamari.  This place has a nice spin on a lot of classics and is definitely a place I would like to frequent."}
{"text":"fun happy hour place! good appetizer selection! great beers! funny bartenders!"}
{"text":"I love the happy hour menu here. All the times we have been here, we always stick to the happy hour menu since the options are delicious! Their buffalo wings, hummus and cheese sticks are my favorite! A great place with a \"dive bar\" feel to it."}
{"text":"Great service bringing you great food. I highly recomend the happy hour. The little munchies that are half off are as big of a draw after work as the beer. Great place to catch a game with friends as well."}
{"text":"The food was very good and our order came out fast. The server was a little more concerned with the table of people playing trivia, than us and the person who ran the trivia was a little course but they only have trivia one or two nights a week, and the food really is very good.  Everyone was friendly, besides the person hosting the trivia, and the food was priced nicely. I will most definitely come back,"}
{"text":"For me, the best thing about the Armadillo Grill was the waitress.  Fast, attentive, very good interaction with multiple (and difficult) personalities, and knowledgeable of the product.    As far as the food goes, the person I was with swears by their spicy chicken wings.  I'm a big boy and I enjoy having more than a little bite into a wing only to encounter bone on the next nibble, so ... pass for me.  I had the veggie burger, which I would best describe as falafel on a bun.  If you like falafel, you'll like this.  The salad dressing (blue) was weak and the salad itself nothing special.  Likewise, the iced tea was watery.    I was also surprised how warm it was in the restaurant.  Plenty of fans going, but it felt really stuffy  (ironically, when we left later, it felt cooler outside on the wrap-around patio with misters than it did inside.    My friend took me here so we could talk about some private issues he was having.  Why he chose this place -- outside of the fact he's a wing fanatic -- is beyond me.  It is a sports bar and this was evident even at 3pm, when you would think most people would be at work.  To say the noise level was a bit loud is like saying Liberace was slightly flaming.  There were no games on, that I could see, but by the shouts and testosterone-fueled \"yeahs\" you heard every 2 minutes, you would think the Superbowl was moved to a Thursday.  So, in conclusion, while fans of this place will no doubt have many unflattering comments to throw at me -- most regarding my obvious lack of masculinity -- I can only say that this would be the place to go if you're seriously into sports bars or just can't live without their wings.  As for me, I'll take my obviously nelly self to a real place where I can enjoy my food and conversation in peace."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, not your typical bar food, they take it up a (few) notches.  Wait and Bar staff are  great: fast, friendly attentive but not \"lurkers\" ( you know what I mean!) Off track betting!"}
{"text":"Went to Armadillo Grill today because of the 4 stars out of 158 reviews. Our waitress gave us wrong information about the ingredients for my meal twice (I'm vegan and specifically asked if the veggie burger had milk or egg, then I asked for the street tacos with a substitute of avacado and black beans and after saying that was fine she came back and said no the black beans where only for the veggie burger and I could only have avocado on it.) So I told her to forget it and to bring our appetizer the hummus and pita bread and my boyfriends order of beef street tacos. His order came first before the appetizer. She blamed this one someone in the kitchen. She did not provide utensils or napkins and she did not bring him the refried beans and rice that came with the order. We didn't mention it and just asked for the the utensils and napkins.  My boyfriend said taco bell had better tacos than here. There hummus was nothing special however the pita bread was very fluffy and delicous.  She then came by and asked me if she could get me a brownie or something for all the trouble. ( previously I let her know I do not eat milk or eggs because I am vegan, thought that was a bit of a sick joke. ) I just ignored that and said I'm sure that has milk in it and she laughed and said that was a rhetorical question.  Yea I found that ironic given her lack of waitress skills.  Then the check came. It was the wrong check charged for 2 full street taco meals and hummus with an additional charge of olives which I don't know where that came from. I brought it to her attention that I believe the order was incorrect she again blamed someone in the kitchen for the error again.  I won't be coming back. Oh not to mention in the booths the light is right above your eyes as you watch the game without a dimmer or fogged sheild.   Enjoy you mediocore food, overpriced beer, and fucked up orders. Read the Google reviews much more accurate experience than yelp."}
{"text":"Our waitress at the bar was super nice. I had the chicken sandwich of some sort which was okay but the Buffalo chicken sandwich was delicious"}
{"text":"This is such a great place for dinner. The service is great, the specials are awesome and I have never had a bad experience. I highly recommend their wings and the spinach artichoke dip. Yum!"}
{"text":"Well, the wings were TAKEN OFF the happy hour (or any) special. Due to that, I go A LOT LESS than I used to, even tho I live very near (walking distance).  I still stop by cuz I like the atmos, the staff, and occasional betting."}
{"text":"Too many TVs tuned to horse racing, bartender and servers all must've been having bad days. Can't comment on the food. Two stars for good beer selection, but lots of better choices nearby."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place.  Good prices all day long, but stick around long enough and there will be some random even greater special price of the day.  Love that even on the special prices for cocktails you still get a fairly decent pour.  The patio is great at night for watching all the crazy drivers on Camelback.  Service is always pretty good, and the managers are always roaming about helping aid in good service.  They have pool tables and tons of TVs.  I've only had one thing here that I didn't like, and that was just a personal preference thing (their nachos are with the cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese) The 1/2 price munchie menu for late night is awesome.  I have a love affair with their Hummus....soooo good!!  Definitely a place to check out for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar that doesn't feature live music. The wait and bar staff are great and remember you after you've been there a few times. The average patron is professional but not pretentious, it's a down to earth crowd. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that they took the drunken salmon dish off the menu."}
{"text":"I recently went here  for dinner upon  my arrival in Phoenix from San Diego. I will first say that the food was absolutely delicious and would bring me back, we had the fried pickles as an appetizer, they were very good , I recommend getting half cajun style and half original. For dinner I had the buffalo chicken burger, if you like buffalo chicken get this it was delicious to the end with its brioche bun. My friend got the fish tacos which was a huge serving but she thoroughly enjoyed. My conclusion on their food was big portions (I would share next time unless you want leftovers), delicious, and there was a good variety on the menu. As far as the service is concerned (I will first say that I myself am a server so I have taken into account quite a few things),our server took forever to come to get our order and when she finally did she just got the drink order then proceed to run around her section without our drinks for at least five minutes ( we all got beer so should have been fairly quick), then after she dropped those off even though we had our menus stacked to indicate readiness she left and did not return for about 10 minutes. Might I add that it was happy hour when we got there but since she did not take our full order for about 15 minutes we did not get to take advantage of it because the computers switch over automatically. Not to mention she had to keep running back and forth to ask questions, I get it there is a lot to memorize but their menu is fairly small and if you work happy hour you definitely need to know your drink menu. All in all I would return but don't go starving because it may be a while. Delicious food, average service."}
{"text":"I've been going to Armadillo Grill for years. Tai the manager is great. He is such a hard worker! What a great place. They have AMAZING FOOD! It's worth trying because the Food is more than great. You can play pool, listen to music, go for drinks or place bets. I recommend going there to eat I can't say it enough delicious! The staff and the over all atmosphere is laid-back, and cool. Check it out for dinner and drinks afterwork with your friends-it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Cool barly bar. Dropped in pre dinner and enjoyed the scene. Probably won't go back but did appreciate the modern armadillo logo. It was everywhere."}
{"text":"I was in love with this place. Food and drinks have always been terrific and at reasonable prices for what you get. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"For at least 5 years I've been driving past this place, and always appreciated the name. Yet, never actually tried it out. This afternoon we finally did. It was terrific. Food and drinks were great. We ordered fried pickles, which I am a huge fan of anywhere, but they definitely had by far the best fried pickles ever! Try them with Cajun. Great atmosphere, the waiter was always around the corner and kept checking on us plenty of times throughout our lunch. Will definitely come here more often."}
{"text":"This is the most inviting place I have ever been to.  It's \"Cheers\" and \"Friends\" wrapped into one.  The food is outstanding, the customer service is top notch and the pricing is fabulous.  My co-worker and I are regulars on most Fridays and thoroughly enjoy coming here. You have to try this establishment, you will not regret it.  Oh, by the way, the Fish Tacos are to die for."}
{"text":"I have about 30 different choices when it comes to the cheap-drink+bar food combo in my hood. I also have about 300 lunch choices. What keeps me coming back to the 'Dillo is the perfect blend of:  - Delicious food (drink or no drink) - Reasonable drink prices - Servers who go out of their way to learn about their customers   Yes, 2PM on a Monday can be depressing. But isn't that true everywhere?  Eat the Philly Cheesesteak. Just eat it. It will be the best decision you made all week. Totally worth the extra gym time."}
{"text":"We went into Armadillo Grill for lunch and to watch football. I was very impressed with the atmosphere and food. We had drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Everything was phenomenal. We loved the mozzarella bites. This is one of the few bars I have been to that also has horse racing. Really good time!"}
{"text":"Really good bar food ... My go to place when it's late, after 10 and nothing really good is open.  Skip the margaritas .. they're horrible .. stick with beer or straight alcohol :)"}
{"text":"Strange place. First time I came here, we sat outside on their large patio for a few drinks and appetizers. I had a bloody mary that was not very flavorful, and some calamari that was also very bland. But, it was an OK experience, and the service was friendly, so we decided to go back for lunch. This time, we sat inside. The walls are lined with TVs showing stats on all the horse races. I think we were the only ones here NOT betting on the races. It was OK, just a little weird and it felt like a really lonely dark dungeon. I had the shrimp scampi for lunch and it was actually delicious! Their Armadillo Ale isn't bad either. I also like that they have daily specials on food and drinks.  I would come here again but probably not during the afternoon since the atmosphere is kind of depressing, but for a few evening drinks, the Armadillo grill is a good choice."}
{"text":"Best tomato bisque and grilled cheese ever!"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, cheap pool. AMAZING bar food... best in town. I don't know which chef they have locked up back there, but they bring out some amazing food. Certainly unexpected... but it keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"12/27/17 Update- Virginia is still the best. So happy we love in the neighborhood and have a bar like this.   We *love* this divey bar! It's actually not that divey at all. They have plenty of table space and a really delicious menu! We always sit in Virginia's section. She's been here forever and knows how to serve in a bar. They have tons of TVs and always play the games you want to see. And Off Track Horse Racing? They've got that too! Go Horsey Go! Their happy hour is awesome and I'm Sunday too! Regardless of if its a game day. Just go check them out."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars, I would! Their food is great, and their service has always been good. we go there very regularly and have tried almost their entire menu. One thing I really appreciate is that they have a much nicer menu than the regular pub / bar. They also do a weekly special that while I may not like every weekly special, it is unique in that I have not seen it repeat. They are not afraid to come up with new ideas, and some of those ideas have been insanely good- like their chicken hummus sandwich- sounded odd, so I ordered a burger, but the wife tried it and it was so good, we both went back a couple days later so we could have one before next weeks special replaced it. That has happened several times too, and it is a very pleasant change for dining. The manager is also great- a few years back, they were experimenting with other beers on tap, and in doing so removed Guiness from their selection. I voiced my concerns over this as I am a Guiness drinker, and to my surprise, we went there a few weeks later and she personally came up to me, apologized and told me they brought back Guiness! Talk about valuing their customers! This is rare in todays business culture, and that incident made us into long-term patrons! Great food. Great booze. It really has become our favorite place to go when we want to relax, have a drink and a nice meal!"}
{"text":"That may have been the best service I've recieved at any restaurant I've eaten at in the almost two years I've lived in Arizona. Normally, it's annoying when a waitress asks me how I'm doing every 5 minutes, but she was not just trying to earn an extra buck. She was genuinely concerned.  The missing star is because of the style (or lack there is) in the music I heard there. The waitress said it was the bartender's iPod mix. Anyway, I'd bet that they normally play better music."}
{"text":"Love the tomato soup and toasted cheese sandwiches - best in the world"}
{"text":"Great place.  We came here while waiting for our tire to be fixed at Discount tire.  Great service- the waitress really kept an eye on us.  We had the pita and hummus munchie. Delicious!   We'll be back."}
{"text":"We visited during the super bowl. It was busy but we were seated immediately. Food was good and came out in a timely manner. The tomato soup was really good. Very creamy and rustic. Bathroom is less to be desired. The waitress was very attentive. We had wings, calamari, the fried cheese is freakin awesome and it was all half off. Super cheap during happy hour. Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"This is a great spot.  You won't believe me until you try it but they have one of the best Ahi Tuna salads in the valley.  Not kidding.  And the asian cole slaw?  Un-real.  Some of the best \"bar food\" I've ever had.  Good happy hour (half priced apps and drink specials) makes me happy.  place is always busy during the afternoons for off track betting which is fun while you're having a guiness and stuffing your face!  Tv's are small but there are a lot of them so you can watch sports from anywhere in the bar.  Nice patio outside with tv's for you smokers.  I happen to live right by here and am stoked to have a place like this next door to call my second home :)"}
{"text":"Great food and Jason and the gang at the bar are great.  I found it by accident and keep going back. I can't give it 5 starts until they have HD."}
{"text":"The hostess was extremely rude when our group walked in. She exclaimed a profanity upon seeing our group and said \"oh great, 10 people that are going to just go straight to the bar\". We feel sorry for her and her opportunities in life with such a poor attitude. The fact that there was only 5 other people in the bar, you'd think they would be happy to see new people walking in...we do not recommend this business."}
{"text":"Great place and good food, but parking is the main issue why I don't usually come here after 6pm because you can hardly find a spot here.  Food was okay, they have HH menu for half priced of their Munchies menu.  I ordered Black Pepper Calamari, the taste was good, but it wasn't worth the half price they charged me.  The portion wasn't big at all, so I wouldn't recommend you order that dish.  I ordered one of their burgers that I couldn't remember the name.  It was very tasty and the sides come from many choices, including sweet potato fries.  Not many places offer this options and of course I picked it.  However I think I got food poison from this place, but I doubt that I'll return here again any time soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointing return after 5years our waitress forgot to order sliders they had to reheat the potatoes skins and came back burned!! Not happy!! down!! Will not come back!"}
{"text":"$1.25 well drinks are the main draw for me on Thursdays at Armadillo Grill, a nice sports bar - but the well drink special is little known about so it doesn't attract as skeezy of a scene as one would think.   I've been here several times, and I'm told that the food is pretty decent too.  Some restaurant industry friends of mine frequent the place as they serve food until 1 AM.  The bartenders are friendly, the confines are very spacious and service is always decent.   Check it out."}
{"text":"The food was ok but was charged 10.00 a piece for 2 margaritas on the rocks because they used patron without asking if I even wanted to shelf!!! $20.00 For two watered down drinks is a rip off!!"}
{"text":"Service needs improvement. The waitress forgot to bring a drink we ordered and rarely checked in with us. The beer was flat. We overheard the bartender rudely questioning the flat beer... very unprofessional. Eclectic Mac and Cheese was okay, but nothing special. Advertised happy hour beer specials but that didn't show up on our check. Also almost fell out of the booth because the bench seat was broken."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 3 years and have to say it always delivers.  The drink specials are addicting, the food is way beyond what you'd expect at a bar, and the scene on weekends is packed full of people looking to kick back after a long week's work, relax, and have a good time.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I just randomly went into The Armadillo Grill. I don't usually try new places, but I'm so glad I did. My boyfriend and I started out with fried pickles, and they're some of the best I've had. The fried pickles come in two different flavors, original and Cajun; we got half and half. The pickles are spears, rather than chips.  For dinner I had the Grilled Cheese with soup; I could eat this every day it was so good. It was made with two types of cheese on sour dough bread, and they have a different soup every week.  I give the food a 10, but the service was poor. I'm a server, so I know what the restaurant business is like. My boyfriend never got offered another beer, and I didn't get a refill on my soda until I was finished. I rarely saw my server, but she mentioned they had a groupon ending that day so that would explain her lack of attention. Although, the place didn't seem busy to me.  Overall, I will be a returning customer. I have already recommended this place multiply times."}
{"text":"Fried pickles ... that's all I have to say. Beer was great, server was awesome and the crowd was cool. I've been once, but it was definitely worth going again, especially for the happy hour(s)... Pretty awesome if i do say so myself."}
{"text":"Love armadillo grill. Their wings are unreal and I love wings. Really good deals during the week. two pool tables and horse race betting."}
{"text":"Food was bland and disgusting.   Server was very nervous and forgetful multiple times.  Overpriced but used cheap ingredients. Got food poisoning due to botch food THEY recommended."}
{"text":"This place is the best for everything , food , customer service , and just too notch !! The staff is exceptional and they always make me feel welcome ! And are very personable which I love ! The ranch dressing is the best ever and the burgers and hot wings and chimichanga and also the calamari are all to die for !!! I love the iced tea as well ! Best ever ! This is my favorite spot to go period and I've tried a lot of places."}
{"text":"I've ordered the meatloaf dinner, smothered chicken meal and the grilled cheese with tomato soup in the past. All of the food has been really good."}
{"text":"Mediocre, at best. Very disappointed in flavors in all but hamburger. The enchiladas, penne pasta,soup, meat loaf were all flavorless except for hot spices used to cover it up. No recommendation on this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Coming from the east coast finding a place with a great steak and cheese was important and this place fits the bill.  The food is always consistently good, the waitstaff has always been efficient and friendly and there are plenty of tv's for any game you want to watch. This place is a must go to bar."}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly service from ALL of the staff including servers from other tables, our server, the owners, etc. The excellent customer service combined with the delicious food makes this a top spot for my family.  Can't go wrong with their seared ahi soba salad and chicken and brie sandwich on focaccia bread and a plate of deep fried real mozzarella to start.  Our server was quick to answer any questions and also offered to swap fresh veggies in for cooked veggies as my side.  The kid's menu was a cut above the norm. My kids were impressed with their full plates fresh linguini, quesadillas and fresh fruit, and chicken fingers with fries.   We will be back for sure and we highly recommend this restaurant for their friendly faces and fantastic food."}
{"text":"Small crowd at the bar on a recent happy hour weekday. The Beer prices are great - I'm always looking for under $3 happy hour booze ($2.75 bottle domestic) and it was a fairly routine visit. It appears this a bar that totally relies on regulars and they also have horse betting. Mostly fried food on the HH menu, but the fried cheese was interesting as it was drenched in panko crumbs and came three giant triangles to an order ($5). Nothing wild on the menu, which is surprising, simply based on this bar's name. It looks like fried pickles were the best they could invent."}
{"text":"Happy hour was pretty decent, service was on point...best part? Seared tuna salad! Definitely good enough to keep going back :)"}
{"text":"I tried this place for happy hour today after driving past it for months. I was surprised at how crowded it was for 5:40 on a Wednesday, until I learned that they offer \"Mexican Hump Day\" specials on Wednesdays. Yep, for real.  The ambiance is that of any traditional sports bar, and although my party only drank and didn't sample the food, there seemed to be plenty of interesting menu items. The drink prices were very good and it seems they offer different deals daily.  Seems like a good place for group happy hours, but not so much for a date."}
{"text":"After constantly passing the Armadillo Grill I started to wonder was it any good? So I read my fellow yelpers reviews. I was impressed with so many positive comments! I decided to go in and try it on a Wednesday afternoon. The place is pretty cool with a nice patio. The well drinks $3 not bad at all. The bartender a friendly gal name Kerri, that afternoon, who asks your name and introduces herself with confidence. The Dillo Burger and Fries I chose, was awesome! Burger was tasty, juice and fresh cooked to a perfect Medium as requested and steak fries were cooked to the perfect crispness.  Oh yeah I'll be returning! Trying to keep myself away as I write this an it approaches happy hour now when appetizers go to half price and drinks get even cheaper, and well it is Friday!  The only thing I don't like about the place is the number of TV screens with the off track betting results. Also the TVs are placed just a bit to high up for shorty here also."}
{"text":"My boyfriend (the lucky Nader A.) and I were driving past, feeling hungry and irritable late at night. We went and it looked like a standard sports bar--not the kind of place I'd usually go to, but it was late and our options were limited.  We sat down in a dimly lit booth and looked skeptically at the menu. We decided to go with the Fried Pickles, the Fingers and Fries, and the Buffalo Chicken Burger. I expected standard greasy bar food, but Holy Jesus, it was AMAZING! The fried pickles are huge and the batter is wonderful. I'll eat 3 of them (they come in orders of 6) and start feeling full. The Fingers and Fries are also great, the chicken is some of the most tender I've ever had. You can very gently pull it apart with your fingers. Absolute bliss. I think they use corn flakes or something in the batter; it's very flavorful and thick. I usually get the Fingers and Fries with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.  The Macaroni and Cheese with Buffalo Chicken is also worth stopping in for. I always have an internal battle about whether I want that or the Fingers and Fries. The waitresses are always friendly and the place isn't usually too busy. I tried branching out for the enchiladas and wasn't very impressed, but that's fine--I'll stick to what's good.   I'm here pretty regularly whenever I feel like throwing my diet to the wind...which happens at least once a week because of those damn fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Fried pickles in phoenix?  Okay, so they are not the same as the fried pickles at Julians in Providence.  but they are actually quite good.  We like 'em with the cajun seasoning and the buffalo sauce for dipping.  Ooh so good and hot!    They have beer.  They have lots of beer and will keep it coming.  Beware of the tall beers.  They have  way of sneaking up on you.    Their burgers are great.  They use high quality beef when making them.  I enjoy a burger where I feel like I don't need it covered in cheese to enjoy the flavor.  I don't especially like cheese on a burger but will order it when I think a place is going to be mediocre so that it covers up the flavor.  Their burgers are served on a brioche that is not buttered (yay!).    I also enjoy their pulled pork sandwich.    For their sides:  The steak fries are yummy here if you're feeling decadent.  their onion rings are really, really yummy if you're feeling extra decadent.  their salad is really good and comes with a vast assortment of unique dressings.    Now the downside.  If you got on a Friday or Saturday night then don't expect to be able to carry on a conversation with your friends.  The music is LOUD and inside it is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation unless you're yelling.    Most other times this is just a great place to come hang out, have some beers with friends with no attitudes.  Great, friendly service.  The manager on duty is always around."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the fact that this place has a dive bar type feel because it is pretty amazing! I live super close and I have honestly found myself to be a regular here.   Super awesome prices and some super awesome food. My favorite is hands down the armadillo gold sauce. It's so perfectly sweet and savory and spicy- I think about it toooooo much. I get it tossed with the chicken tenders and it comes with a side of fries. So good!   This place also has some really awesome happy hour! Happy hour runs til 7pm and they have some really good deals on apps and drinks. I would recommend the fried pickles (Cajun and regular).  ALSO, They have a reverse happy hour again from 10pm to 2am... how have I not taken advantage of this???   Seriously folks, take a chance on the armadillo grill."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place that was open late that had some veggie options. We came here based on the yelp reviews and this place was really excellent for what it is. (Granted what it is is a sports bar and grill) But the quality of the food and the service was way beyond.  Great Caesar salad with fresh lemon and they brought fresh ground pepper. And the quesadilla came with guac and salsa that were fresh and delicious. House made veggie burger was also very good. Our server was super friendly and even brought us waters to go without is asking. Really great experience."}
{"text":"It's ok, probably more of a place to be a sports bar than a grill. I would go back for drinks but not likely the food."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Their food is excellent quality and the portions are large. The buffalo chicken sandwich is by far one of the best menu items! Also the papadillos (fried mashed potato balls with bacon inside) will melt in your mouth and the sweet potato fries are perfect. This is a great find and everyone is very friendly! If you are a beer person, they have a great beer!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty solid neighborhood bar and grill. We came in right at the end of happy hour, which has great prices on drinks and apps. The bar actually has a pretty good selection and the regular prices aren't bad either.  Overall the food was good, although I thought the onion rings and fried pickles had too much batter on them. The service was a little slow, it took a bit to get our check once we asked for it after our plates had been cleared for a while. All in all I would definitely come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Though I am not exactly a fan of sports bars, this one appeals to me for a number of reasons. The location is convenient -- right on Camelback near the Colonnade area and the 51 (and a bias factor: it's in my neck of the woods). The place does not look big from the outside but once you enter, you'll find a spacious dining area which includes comfortable booths as well as standard bar seating. The food is really good, affordably priced, and the choices include many comfort food favorites. There are the usual big screens showing sports programs which is a plus if you are a sports enthusiast but none are loud enough to detract from comfortable conversation with your dining companions. And last but not least, they are open till 2 AM, which means my friends and I can enjoy a substantial meal when hunger pangs hit after a late night out."}
{"text":"Father's Day dinner, not good! The cook must LOVE salt, because my chicken parm was sooooo salty. The calamari was soooo salty. The fish and chips was missing that light flakey  batter. The Long Island drink special had way to much sour mix and can't help but wonder if he or she made me a virgin. Picking new places to try is always a gamble."}
{"text":"Love this place! I love their eclectic menu and I've been pleased with everything I've tried. Number ONE place for calamari! I have yet to go there without ordering it."}
{"text":"The server was off putting, but that always happens when you wear that much mascara.   The bf and I ate here after our hair person told us they had fried pickles.  We sat in rush over traffic after our day jobs and parked in a handicap spot in order to totally fuck with the system.  Actually, the paint was faded on the spot and we just couldn't tell either way.  We didn't get towed, but you might.  This place is bigger than you'd think and when we came in we were seating promptly by some chick whose probably a junior in high school and really proud of herself for working AND going to school AND doing yearbook AND trying out for the musical this year.   The reason this place is worth trying is because the happy hour, as far as happy hours goes, it's pretty fucking awesome.  Half price FULL size apps is alone worth the trip.  Since they were cheap, we ordered a shit load of stuff and tried to act like we had NO IDEA how much food we were ordering, but we did.  We got the calamari, the wings, the spinach and artichoke dip and the fried fucking pickles.  We also got some beer and some Long Islands and talked about why Waterworld ruined Kevin Constner's career.    The calamari was mediocre at best, mostly batter, but you know, it's calamari, what do you expect?  It wasn't horrible, it was edible and after two Long Island's not bad at all.  The wings were a bit cold and we ordered honey hot but got barbecue instead (I don't send shit back, I silently sulk and drink more), but overall they were okay, especially for the price.  The fried pickles were better than the ones you get at Lucille's but you have to be a fan of fried pickles to like them either way.  The star of our meal was definitely the spinach and artichoke dip especially since spinach and artichoke dip is some Chili's Applebee's Ultra American bullshit that usually tastes like kitten vomit.  This stuff was good though, a little spicy, creamy, not to clumpy and served in an 80's style bread bowl with tortilla chips and slices of bread that should have been toasted but weren't.    Our tab was about 50 bucks with a tip which wasn't so bad for how much food and booze we got.  I'm not giving it more stars for a few reasons.  1.  they fucked up our wing order 2.  it took us like a half hour to get our food and they brought ALL the apps out at once which seems retarded when you're just ordering apps. 3. it was fucking dark in there. 4. soooo much mascara.   Overall, I'd go back just for the dip and some drinks.  I'm pretty drunk right now actually, I could go for some fried pickles."}
{"text":"Love the food- atmosphere is a little dark but, food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Fun place! The staff is awesome, very friendly and efficient. Food is very good--I especially enjoy the hummus plate and the grilled cheese with tomato soup. Drinks are very reasonably priced. Great atmosphere and a perfect choice for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I LOVEEE this bar & grill. Me and my boyfriend at the time were huge regulars there for the past 2 years, although from time to time I enjoy coming back. The bartenders are all amazing, fast paced and on top of their game. They make great food suggestions and their tap selection is good.   You couldn't ask for a better restaurant that caters to everyone's needs. if you want the divey bar feel, they have a great bar set up with new TV's stationed, Megatouch play, pool and darts, and a race horse gambling area. If you're looking just to dine with a candlelit dinner, they have a quiet section in the restaurant and around the bar as well."}
{"text":"Great place! Really a hidden gem. Good is great and prices are awesome! Order off the menu to get a spicy Bloody Mary  really.. this place is awesome! Ambience is okay, but for service, food, and price this place has earned !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend mentioned that we weren't that pleased with our food and the waitress took 50% off both our entrees. A+ for customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times for happy hour. This place at first glance is very much a dive pub. Small TVs that need to be badly upgraded take up most of the wall space. The reason for this which you will figure out real quick once inside is that Armadillo Grill is an offsite track betting place as well.   75% of the TVs (during non-sporting events) will be focused on races across the country and you can go place a bet with a bookie up front as if you were at the track. Kinda cool...but betting on horses is not really my thing.   Drinks here are your typical bar drinks with a limited selection on happy hour but enough to find something. The Happy hour menu (munchies) has quite a few things on there which are good however the reason to come here are the \"Golden Delicious\" wings. These are what put this place on my radar....those wings are VERY good that it is hard to order anything else anytime I come here.   As far as non-happy hour....they have your typical pub cold and hot sandwiches like buffalo chicken sandwich and Philly cheesesteak. Nothing is too expensive, but the happy hour is where this place shines.    Give this place a shot if you are ever in the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"Still a fan, but seems like they're starting to lose their luster.  All the food's pretty solid, but the pricing isn't as nice.  Wings are now not on happy hour.  Not as many specials.    The worst though is that not everything's included!  Apparently, you get 1 topping of your choice with the philly cheesesteak sandwich and then you can get additional peppers, mushrooms or whatever for a dollar a piece.  Seriously??!  If you wanted everything that's in a \"standard\" sandwich you'd be paying 15 bucks!  That's plain greedy."}
{"text":"Met a friend for Happy Hour here. This place wouldn't be at the top of my Happy Hour list but far from the worst. I didn't realize The Armadillo Grill was more of a bar. Food was OK and service was consistent. The place wasn't too crowded. Now that I know what to expect, I would be happy to return here for Happy Hour. Cheers***"}
{"text":"I've probably eaten here 20 times.  10 times w/ my wife too.  Always good food and eaten a bunch of different things.  Good deal and good service too.  Food will surprise you"}
{"text":"A good place to take dive bar fans, sports fans, and foodies. Always have a great experience here."}
{"text":"Tasty, tasty food. We mostly go on reverse happy hour and just get apps, but their burgers are really yummy. And the tomato soup! The tomato soup is creamy with chunks of real tomato and their \"cup\" sized bowl is huge. So many good beers here and the Nimbus Old Monkeyshine goes perfectly with the soup. Their fried pickles come in spears but you can ask for slices. The Armadillo gold wings are tasty (and I'm not a huge fan of wings) but stay AWAY from the hummus because it's terrible.   The staff is friendly and nice, but one time we had horrible service. The water pitcher we asked for since the waitress only came by every 20 minutes had 1/2 water, 1/2 sprite. They got rid of her really quickly, so now everyone is nice.   One last thing. Monday is free pool night, so it's always packed and loud."}
{"text":"Wow! talk about roll back prices....$1.75 wells, $3 sky's and half price munchies cost only $3.50. Rest assured the prices are not reflected in the taste at all! We ordered 2 orders of buffalo wings with Armadillo Gold sauce, potato skins, hummus and fried pickles. The wings were delicious, finger tasting good! Except I didn't care for the red onions tossed on top of the wings, easily picked off, but none the less weird! I have never had a buffalo wing served with raw onions, and i'm not about to start (next time i'll ask them to leave them off-i hate to waste food=even if its just a few diced onions). The fried pickles had a delicious breading so i didn't mind that they weren't the true dill pickles i'm used too. The ranch for the pickles was a little runny, but tasty. The potato skins were also very tasty, and best part is there was little to no grease on top because I asked them to leave the bacon off. They were cooked to precision, not dry or over baked what so ever! They sure do know how to served a good drink too. The service was good, we didn't have to wait long for anything. There were a lot of of men due to the off track betting, so you can imagine the lack of women hanging out just for the fun of it. Something about old men smoking cigarettes non-stop checking out the race sheets and pissed of about dropping money in a second keeps women away, but don't let that keep you from trying this place, especially for the Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Oh, Armadillo Grill...you are something special.  The first time I came here it was late at night and I wasn't expecting much at all. From the outside this bar didn't really look like my style, but the moment I stepped inside, I was confused. It's had a semi-dive feel and there were a couple of really good DJs that night. I began to think that this place was going to be an alright spot to eat late at night. Then I had the food...  Two words: Fried Pickles. I've had them before at other places but Armadillo serves the best I've ever had. They were mind-boggling good! Not only were they like delicious sin in my mouth, they were also on a happy hour menu! $3.50 for an order of six! After the pickle came the chicken and I can say with confidence that it's the best chicken I've had at a bar. It doesn't matter if you get the strips or the buffalo chicken sandwich, they are both mouthwatering (writing about it right now is making me hungry). That night I left really content and sure that I would be back, and not just late at night!  Once I returned I knew I should try a few other things but I'm always compelled to get the chicken. I did manage to taste the mac and cheese (with buffalo chicken!), their wings and the chicken parm. Everything was spectacular (especially as far as pubs go)!  The staff at Armadillo Grill has always been great and I'm sure they will continue to be as I wiggle my way into becoming a regular here! Great happy hour, great food and friendly service in a really chill bar equals two huge thumbs up from me (I jammed them so they're both swollen)!"}
{"text":"Great man cave!!! The bar area has plenty of TVs and OTB if you into the ponies. I had a very good salad and fish and chips that was done just right..  Just right? Yea the fish was not fried to shoe leather and the breading was fried to a perfect golden brown!! There is also a dining area as well away from the bar if you do not wish to man cave it....  Friendly service and daily drink and food specials puts this on my \"go back to\" list when in the PHX area."}
{"text":"One of the best Restaurants in Phoenix. Great selection. Great prices, and you get a lot of food. It's opened late and the have what they call munchies ar 1/2 price 2x a day. Great customer service..."}
{"text":"A 'dive' bar in the Camelback area? Well. It's actually not that 'divey' . For one. It's really quite a treat. A little gem that is hidden like a dive. I met my love here for a quick happy hour before we headed out for dinner with friends. A pre-game before the real game , if you will. My expectations weren't that high, but that is okay. My boyfriend loves a good divey bar that is not so trendy and yuppie, as he puts it. This to me was just nice and surprising. The bar staff was super friendly. The beer on tap was nice and cold. Peach Ale from 4Peaks is always a win-win for me! 4Peaks Kiltlifter on tap for him. Off track betting on the tele. Pool tables around the place. For 345pm in the afternoon, it was already packed! We didn't want to mess our appetites up, so we only opted for the fried pickles and went half regular and half cajun spicy. YUMMY! Besides, on happy hour they are $3.50; one of the best happy hour menu pricings around and that is important! I loved being happy when I think I may end up turning my nose up at something.. Just goes to show: Listen to Yelp!"}
{"text":"O yeah, we had to go back here. I really like the atmosphere and they have great specials. Plus they have gambling and tasty food. This time I ordered the signature soup, rustic tomato and a starter salad. I wasn't in the mood for heavy food and that was perfect. The salad was a salad but nicely done. No package salad here.The soup was delicious, a little cool, I should have mentioned it to our server but I didn't want her to take it from me.  LOL!  Very creamy and full of flavor. Hubby ordered the wings, extra crispy, and he really liked them. They looked awesome. Of course it was Tuesday , the Tuesday Teas were featured, hubby had one and enjoyed it.  Will definitely be back, very good food and we like the way it's presented.You can tell the kitchen takes pride in what goes out. We eat with our eyes first, you know? Keep up the good work, it's appreciated!    Linda"}
{"text":"i went there once a while back and it was dirty and never went back... but if Stevey is right about the drink specials i might have to re-visit"}
{"text":"3.5, but I am not putting a 3.   Looked like a neighborhood place from the outside, and that is what the Armadillo Grill is - a neighborhood sports bar.  The Glass walls revealing the two-sided patio wrap-around is a nice touch.  The host demonstrated awareness as he sat us at our table - good start!   One of the specials of the day - paper-wrapped salmon was well done and affordable!  I had the Cajun(?) meatball sandwich from the regular menu - next time I will take the marina option - but I enjoyed trying it.   Note - I detected some stale beer odor on a second visit June 7th in the early afternoon."}
{"text":"Trivia was a blast! They host Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday night trivia at 7:30 pm...and Elaine (Tuesday and Wednesday) is great. It depends on who is around you and who you bring with, but they have decent drink specials and I've heard the hummus is amazing! We only ordered drinks last night, but I've had lunch here during March Madness, drinks a few times, and a fried mashed potato appetizer. It's a great option for me between work and home!"}
{"text":"Armadillo grill is awsome. There is no simpler way of putting it. The food is always tasty, everything on the menu is good. I generally get the grilled cheese and tomato soup, because their tomato soup is the best I've ever eaten. The bartenders and servers are always nice and efficient. It's never been so busy that I couldn't get a seat, but there is always people there. It's everything I want in a neighborhood bar. Thank you armadillo keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Oh how I love thee Armadillo Grill  Through the years, I still love. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THEIR FOOD!  I order their seared tuna salad without noodles and with the dressing on the side.  YUM.  I love their armadillo gold sauce on the chicken sliders Mmmmm  LOVE."}
{"text":"Boy, did I enjoy those fried pickles and chicken wings. These really did hit the spot when I decided to spurge for my birthday this year!   I know now where I want to come when I want some wings or pickles, or any other tasty bar food. I would be safe to say that the wings I had at Armadillo Grill were some of the best in Phoenix (and I've had a lot of wings throughout the valley). But make sure to order the wings with Armadillo Gold Sauce, they were made to perfection.    Be sure to to have a nice beer and enjoy some games on one of the many screens.  There is also a patio for the warmer weather :)"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for almost 3 years and have been going here on a regular basis ever since. The food is great and the whole staff knows me by name. Different weekly specials every week and nightly specials. It is a well run, clean, and friendly establishment."}
{"text":"First of all I'm a regular here, coming in at least once a week for lunch. In other words, I LOVE this place!  Great food, wide variety, weekly specials, and a frequent diner card.   The servers are super friendly and know their shi....stuff :) Virginia and Amy are awesome.   Tomato soup - hands down the BEST I have ever had. Slightly sweet and very creamy. WOW. Serious mouthgasm.   Smothered chicken - excellent gravy. I have had this one more times than I can count. Corn can be a little dry but you can always substitute a different side.   Fried pickles - these are spears, not slices, but the breading has great flavor and is very crisp.   Quesadillas and burgers are good, fairly standard but still tasty.   All of their pastas are excellent. Can't go wrong here.    Was not a fan of the meatloaf sandwich but the actual meatloaf dinner is well done. This sandwich is the only thing I ever ordered here that left me at all disappointed and I've probably stuffed my face with 3/4 of the stuff on the menu by now.   Overall, their food has a home cooked, fresh flavor. Nothing tastes likes a tv dinner and for a sports bar, it goes above and beyond what I would expect for food.   Love you Dillo, see you soon!"}
{"text":"Great location and even better happy hour munchies. Ordered the honey bbw wings, mozzarella, potato skins, and the calamari which were all delicious especially the wings.Servers were friendly and attentive. Will return someday"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go chill drink and catch up love the environment and cozy customer service! They don't shirt hand your drink either!"}
{"text":"Great salads, decent selection of beer on tap. Doug the Friday bartender is super fast and is definitely my favorite server in the valley. Nice place for friends to hangout."}
{"text":"This place is dang good. Get the buffalo mac it's the bees knees and will leave you wanting more."}
{"text":"The Armadillo Grill is an unpretentious, friendly neighborhood bar/grill in the Biltmore area. The atmosphere and friendly bartenders are a refreshing change of pace from the rest of  the area.   The food isn't bad. But it's not necessarily awe-inspiring, either. A friend insisted I try their famous fried pickles so I did. They were okay, but I mean, it was just a hot claussen covered in breading. Mmm. But hey, if I was hammered, I'm sure I would have been all about it. Another gut-bomb appetizer I indulged in was the fried mozzarella. No explanation needed there. The hummus was better than I expected, though. So were the wings... With both sauces. And no this was not a 1am tuesday binge session. I don't do that anymore.  Good drink specials. Hoegaarden on tap. This is the perfect place to come when you want to get drunk for cheap and cram your face with a bunch of shit you know you shouldn't."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner.  Best Chicken Parm in the state!  Great wait staff and awesome food!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of places in the Phoenix area, and this is the best overall value you can get. Tons of TVs, horse races, great food, great drinks, all at very reasonable prices. I was impressed, not only with the taste of the food, but with the presentation as well. Love this place.  The bar tenders are attentive, receptive, and personable, without being overbearing. This has become a weekly spot for my wife and I to visit, and one which we look forward to spending our money at."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for two years and the food is consistently fantastic. I don't come that often, and it is a pleasant surprise each time how good the food and desserts are because the exterior is so unassuming. Favorite so far is the Smothered Chicken, the Meatloaf is good too. The brownie desert is a must-have for three reasons: 1) It tastes good, 2) the temperatures are perfect and 3) the presentation is fun. What does that mean \"temperatures\"? The brownie is comfortingly warm, the ice cream is ice cold and the raspberry sauce is cool. I've been to other places where the whole dessert is cold, probably because the whole thing is stored in the fridge - which makes the brownie cold, chewy, and sad. No sad food here! Food and dessert at Armadillo Grill and is a happy experience :)"}
{"text":"I've been very disappointed in the Dillo lately. The food hasn't really been as good as it used to be. I don't know if they've changed chefs, or what. In February, my boyfriend ordered a burger with an English muffin bun and there was mold on it. We came here on St. Patrick's Day for their special menu and waited an hour and a half for our food. It wasn't very busy so we figured they were short staffed or something. The server didn't give us any explanation until after we were completely finished with dinner. Apparently one of their fryers had gone out so there was only one that could be used. That would have been a fine excuse if only we hadn't ordered Shepherd's Pie and Corned Beef & Cabbage (both were delish!), which had nothing that needed to be deep fried. I wouldn't have been mad about the wait if wasn't 8:30 by the time we got our food and I didn't have to get up at 4 in the morning. The third star is for server/manager Katie because she deserves her own.."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp. Morgan at the bar very friendly and attentive. Lots of tv's, sports to watch. Good food, reasonable prices. This Jersey Girl would recommend."}
{"text":"Their website is no longer working.  That's never a good sign."}
{"text":"It was very delicious and had good amount of food for the price. I tried the Chicken and Brie sandwich was like a good grilled sandwich. My roommate tried the pull pork sandwich and thought it was good size. Overall, this place was very good."}
{"text":"Brenda L., did you know that TODAY is MONDAY ;) Thanks for the headsup, hon!! I will be back ...perhaps today :)"}
{"text":"Armadillo Grill has always been a great go-to for good bar food. Besides general bar-fare, they offer some of the best weekly dish specials a bar can conjure up. They are not simply a OTB or pool hall... they are much much more.  ~Fud/Drink~ As stated, they have superb dish choices each week. They do seafood/fish surprisingly well. The most memorable dish from here was actually a Basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes. That, my friends, is NOT traditional bar-fare. The chef they have locked up (love that comment Joe S.) does a stellar job. Please don't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up. But this is a multidimensional bar, which makes it so unique. They also have stellar drink specials throughout the week and into the weekend. The barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in! They offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ Once again, service is superb every time I go. I am by no means a regular, but they treat you like one. I feel at home here when I come in to have a bite or shoot some pool. There is no real dive atmosphere, its truly an interesting mix. The inside is by no means \"nice\", its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room. Along with the bar area with the regulars and the OTB on the screens with rooting betters, it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one. You do not need to worry about loud noise though, the patio outside is helpful and can alleviate any issues with inside noise. I never have noticed much of a noise factor though, its a fine spot to both watch a game and dine at. Its impressive how you can go about it at the 'Dillo.  ~Extras/Rating~ Call ahead for specials that day/week, the website they have does not get updated at all unfortunately. Look online, there are numerous coupons available from different spots... I use Entertainment coupons here and they work like a charm! They aren't the finest bar in town, that's understood. But its drink specials, above-par food, central location and outstanding staff each earn a star, giving them 4 overall stars. Much love for the 'Dillo, can't wait to go back and check in!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the menu impressed me a lot. They have entrees from different cultures - Thai, Japanese, Mexican, American, Italian, etc. So whatever cuisine you feel like eating, they'll prob have it. Service is fast and food gets to your table in no time. My favorites? Ahi tuna salad and buffalo mac and cheese. If you're ever torn in choosing what dish to order, try those two. If you're ever torn in choosing between those two, good luck!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem! Our waitress was so down to earth and funny! The ambiance is sporty but not obnoxious. I'm not into sports so I didn't pay attention to the games that were on. The mozzarella wedges were huge and amazing! Dear God was it good and hearty! Almost wanted to find my mama and slap the piss out of her! My friends got fried pickles as well for an app but yuck...pickles..... I ordered a burger and it actually came out medium like I wanted and it tasted like angus beef. Oh it was so juicy meaty and sexy! The bun was a bit soaked though. The fries were hot and seasoned. My Long Island iced tea was good and my friends seemed to enjoy their cocktails. I recommend coming here for a fun night out with friends, especially if you're into sports and friendly waitresses. One of my friends got the chicken parm... oh my God!!!!! It's soooook delicious ! Chicken perfectly seasoned and crispy! The flavor of the park and the noodles....and it's enough to feed a family. Get it and share it with your friends if y'all are broke like me!"}
{"text":"So it has now been over a year since I have been coming to this place and I am happy to say that they are consistent. I must say, I like coming in here sometimes on Sundays though I typically go to other sports bars to watch my team play. Though other bars might be a bit more modern and have twice as many tvs... Armadillo is not nearly as crowded. It is  nice to not have to search for a spot to sit constantly.  On top of that, the bartenders seem to be a bit more chill overall than most. They are pretty laid back and very personable... hard to find as time goes on. Also, their food is just as good as I remember if  not better. I like getting an order of their wings with a side of vegetables. However, if you do not like sauce drenched soft wings, you should take my advice and order them accordingly: sauce on the side and make the wings 'crispy'.  There seems to be a little something for everyone here... If you feel like getting a little horse race betting in, they have it there. If you want to shoot a little pool, feel free. If you want to have random conversations up at the bar with an old man that wants to explain his take on life... you can get that here too! :)"}
{"text":"Jason B. and I decided to try this place on Saturday night. I looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting.  We started with the Artichoke Croquettes, and the Calamari as well. We were disappointed in the Artichoke Croquettes, you get 4 half Artichokes fried with alternating Marinara and this white sauce. The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce, which we used to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was your average calamari, nothing special!   I ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger.  Not sure I will be rushing back to the Armadillo Grill, but I wouldn't say no to going back again!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what I was walking into here. Honestly the place wasn't that bad for what it is. It's like walking into your degenerate uncles apartment to watch sports and horses and listen to gold laden dudes complain about who is better, The Great Brett Favre or That Punk Aaron Rodgers. The food was decent for bar food and the beers were really cheap. That's a huge plus but if you're looking for a good place to watch sports with like minded individuals you might as well keep going. Although I do think you should give it a shot because this might be a good place to make some wagers and walk with some side cash."}
{"text":"Kind of a dive bar, but the food I've had has been good and inexpensive.   I love the chicken parmesan!!"}
{"text":"For what it is, a neighborhood sports bar and grill, the AG exceeds on all counts.  Off track betting, usually friendly service, amazing drink deals, and surprisingly great food - their Armadillo Gold wings may very well be the best in town.    What you won't get here is hipster pretension - but if you're looking for an unassuming place to grab a drink and budget friendly nosh and maybe bet on a horse race - this, ladies and germs, should be your stopping place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Service is great, food is beyond expectations upon seeing the place. I was a little confused on whether I was going to walk into a bar or restaurant and the atmosphere is a bit confusing (pool table between tables and booths with cloth table cloths and napkins,  but one bite of my chicken, brie and glazed pear sandwhich amd I was sold! All food goes beyond standard \"bar food\". I recommend the sandwich I had andthe cajun fried pickles although all my company were satisfied! So glad I moved to the neighborhood and found a reasonably priced local haunt!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time I got their buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese, delicious. The second time I got their grilled cheese and tomato soup. Their grilled cheese was great but I wasn't a fan of the tomato soup. Then again it was rustic tomato soup which I'd never had before. My husband loved it though who doesn't like regular tomato soup at all. Also can't beat their happy hour. $3.75 long islands! Fantastic. Will definitely be back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Great place!  My friends and I go for trivia night and love it! Food is always good (bar food but 100% better than. Other sports bars than Zips). The wait staff is very nice, and friendly.  There are plenty of TVs to watch games. Parking can be a hassle as there aren't a lot of spots so carpool or Uber if you can. Love this place! Will def. Make this one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"Always been wanting to go to this place, so a friend dragged me in here on a night I didn't feel like being out...but this place made everything seem alright.  The staff was friendly but a little slow at the bar to say the least, I ordered a couple of Long Island Ice Tea's which made everything warm and fuzzy. My date ordered a couple of appetizers, can't say I really care for deep fried pickles but the wings were delicious....but how can you fuck up wings. I would have to say that I would like to give this place another ty on the food end of things. But as far as Sports bars go, this place is pretty cool, TV's could be a little bit bigger but that is a matter of opinion. Plenty of stuff to do video games and pool to. Overall not a bad little joint."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch at Armadillo. We've seen this place for years but never stopped before. We were in the neighborhood this time and decided to give it a try. I do not know what is that I was expecting, but this was not it. It was good, though. It is kind of tiny, it is more of a bar... And, oh my, they had something like incense burning or some odd smell... not for me : ( We sat by a corner and Mike was our server. He was outstanding. He asked if we had been there before and gave us some history and recommendations. He was very friendly and approachable.  Well, we like it when a place has a signature dish, and for Armadillo Grill it seems to be fried pickles. Not my proudest moment, truth be told, but they were actually good : P We had half regular, half Cajun. I liked them both but I liked the ranch best.  We ended up ordering the Thai Chicken skewers and the Louisiana meatball sandwich. I just tasted them both as I was not very hungry, I thought they were a good and hubby liked them very much. He said the chicken skewers were very tasty even without the sauce.  I only had water, hubby had diet coke. Next time I will have a beer : )"}
{"text":"The fried mozzarella was awesome, I had the open faced turkey which was pretty good and my boyfriend loved the mac & cheese. Good beer and an excellent place to go to watch football."}
{"text":"The place wasn't too packed it looked like your average \"after work\" crowd...the server was quick and informed us of their happy hour specials. I decided to go with the strawberry margarita; it was pretty good and strong. We decided to order off their \"munchies\" menu, we ordered the salt and pepper calamari, it was cooked perfectly not too chewy and you could really taste the mix of salt and pepper...  and the mozzarella wedges were your standard fried cheese concoction served with marinara. I also ordered the wings in hot honey sauce which surprisingly were really tasty, they weren't hot at all but the sauce had a great sweet smoky flavor to it. Also some random ordered us a round of Washington apple shots so that made the food taste even better! I will def. be back to try some more food off of the regular menu."}
{"text":"So, this is one in the series of reviews I'm throwing up there during my #transientweek adventure during the first week of July thru Southern Nevada and Arizona.  After reading all the reviews, damn, I wish i would have tried some food. We came here while plowing thru bars one night in Phoenix. The prices were very reasonable and got smashed off Kiltlifter and shots of Jameson (this seems to be a very disturbing trend). Our waitresses were the bomb. Had a great time. Cool little shindig of an area if you're in the area.  Plus, Jerome is my hero."}
{"text":"The waiter we had was very disorganized. We kept asking to order at our large party and he kept saying he'd have to check to see if we could order then he'd take an order at the other end of our table. Like fuck me, right? We literally had to get the other side of the table he was catering to, to order our food."}
{"text":"Really good Golden Tee machines and the drinks are priced right. If you like betting the ponies it's one of the cleaner OTB places I've been to. The food is good and the prices are fair. It's a great place to wait for your wife or significant other while they shop across the street."}
{"text":"What can I say, the service was absolutely ruined anything good regarding this place. We came her on Thursday 5/25 about 10:30 we had a group of about 6, however our server, I think his name was Eric, completely ignored us up until the other table across the restaurant had left. Twice I had to get up and go to the bar to get drinks because the server had not come around for more than 20 minutes or more. I think about it now and that's probably the worst 60 dollars I have wasted. Thanks for ruining our night, appreciate it"}
{"text":"Mmmm..so delicious! Came here on a relatively slow day, not a whole lot of people there. The service was excellent, we were happy with that.  The best part was the food, I got a grilled cheese with tomato soup. Ate it all so fast, the soup was especially amazing. Also came during happy hour, so I tried some martinis! My favorite was the Jolly Rancher. Really does taste like a Jolly Rancher. A very cute, girly, pink drink! Also got a Bloody Mary type martini and sent it back because I really did not like it. I think I just prefer to keep my martinis fruity, just my personal taste. Also got a cosmo and it was really strong. Not too bad though, I liked it. My boyfriend got some beers and loved his food as well.   The ambiance of Armadillo Grill is nice as well. Usually do not like places with a ton of TVs and sports playing and whatnot, but I did like it here. Can't wait to give this a second try!"}
{"text":"We drive by The Armadillo Grill all the time and have always thought it was just another bar. We finally decided to give it a try tonight and we were pleasantly surprised. All of the employees were extremely friendly and the service was really fast. If our glasses were less then half full our waitress would automatically bring a new soda.   The Happy hour is a great deal.They have half price munchies and $3 well drinks. We started out with the potato skins which were good because they were made with real potatoes not like the fake looking potatoes you get at chain restaurants. For dinner I had the bar b que pulled pork sandwich and my fiance had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Both were really delicious!!  The atmosphere is fun because you can tell this is the kind of place that has \"regulars\" and where the locals hang out. Not to mention there is a TV practically every 3 feet with some sort of sport on it.   We occasionally go to Turf Paradise but with Armadillo Grill so close maybe will start coming here to do a little off track betting. Much better food than the horse track and a lot less sweaty guys in tank tops."}
{"text":"Good pub grub.  The best fried pickles I've had in Phoenix so far. So many places do the pickle chips, but I prefer the spears. AG has nice, big spears fried in a tasty batter with ranch. From 4-7 you get 6 big spears for $3.  The beef stroganoff is great too. Once you get past stroganoff using bow tie pasta you'll love it.  A little loud at times, lots of sports on the various TV screens, crowded bar area."}
{"text":"Casual, unpretentious bar near The Biltmore area. Decent selection of food and drinks, all reasoably priced. Gaming area, pool tables and outdoor patio with misters. Best of all, it's within stumbling distance of home!!!!!"}
{"text":"Last night me and some friends went to eat here and play some trivia that they host. We've been a few times and normally enjoyed our time there. But this past time was a real let down. My friend's sweet potato fries came out burnt, like real burnt, crispy all the way through the fry. Another friend ordered fish tacos, they were out of batter for the fish fry. Another friend ordered wings, over cooked and burnt. My wings were good, but I ordered the Armadillo Gold(which I highly recommend by the way) but I was given Buffalo wings. This normally isn't a problem for me so I just nicely brought it up to my waitress, but she told me that it was the right flavor and I could never get my Armadillo Gold wings. I really big let down especially when I was looking forward to them all day. Overall the entire experience was a let down, and I'm disappointed because I know the restaurant was a lot better in the past."}
{"text":"Love the wings here. I ate wings at Zipp\"s and bragged over and over. But I ate crow. The wings here are way way better. I am happy my friend Andrea humbled me. I am looking forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a colleague. They put us in a back booth which was perfect - quiet enough for us to get some work done. He had the fish tacos and seemed to enjoy them. I have the palette of a five year-old so I ordered a chicken quesadilla with refried beans added. It was delicious - way too much for one meal. The server was attentive but not overbearing. I was a little concerned about parking because that's an issue for a lot of restaurants on that strip of Camelback but since we met there at 1pm on a Friday, we had no problem with that."}
{"text":"Lot's of TVs and not as crowded during big sporting events as Zipps. The buffalo chicken fingers were decent (although I would have liked a spicier option). The buffalo wings was a tiny portion for the price, however, and a side of fries was relatively expensive. Not a top option for me."}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly service from ALL of the staff including servers from other tables, our server, the owners, etc. The excellent customer service combined with the delicious food makes this a top spot for my friends and family."}
{"text":"First visit just moved to area. Asked server what was fast and good. She suggested meatloaf. I ordered since i just moved was hungry and wanted fast hot food. It was 105 outside sunday but my food was barely warm. Thought it may have sat in a place to long or just wasn't heated to temp. It was really just room temp. Outside temp would have been good"}
{"text":"Hummus, fried pickles, and OTB...hells yeah. This place is awesome.   After having my idea to go bowling vetoed, we went here to kill some time before heading out for the evening and to grab some snacks (and apparently consistently lose money on the horses!) I had been here several times, so I already knew we were in for a treat, but my other half was new to the spot.  They DID NOT disappoint! Everything was fantastic, the server was attentive and kept our drinks refilled, and we had a great time. I had never tried the fried pickles, but if you go, be sure to order them, they are YUMMTASTIC and everyone is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Hearty, tasty food at really good prices. Happy hour food specials are really hard to beat . . . wings in Armadillo Gold style, fried pickles, fried mozzarella, calamari . . . .evidently, everything is from scratch too.  Beef Stroganoff, Chicken Parmigiana, and the fish in parchment are all awesome. Bartenders are friendly, casual, and do a good job. Only time I sat at the table, the waitress was hilarious and fun. I don't drink, so not sure how they poor drinks but probably not too shabby because most of the their clientele seem to be long-term regulars. Update. Everything is still great here. They improved the quality of coffee and raised the price of wings during happy hour (bummer) and now require a foursquare check-in with manager approval to get the new happy hour wing pricing, but still one of my local favorites."}
{"text":"Came here during the day on Sunday - the place was packed! I thought this was odd for Sunday day but also knew that was a great sign.   As I looked around the grill it became apparent to me why the place was bumping. There were 30+ tvs around the restaurant and DUH! Football Sunday! Everyone was on the edge of their seats... (I'm not a sports fan, I was just thirsty! Haha!)  I sat down at the bar. They have a large selection of beers and drink specials for each day. I got a mimosa which was part of that special. It was a quick in and out as I was just killing some time but the bartender Alexis was lovely and checked in on me several times in the short time I was there. This is a fun place with an apparently great crowd! There's also a couple pool tables and an arcade corner. I can see this place coming alive at night!  I really don't have anything negative to say about my experience, so thank you Armadillo Grill! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came for HH and it was fun, we had too much food, and we had FOOD!  2 orders of wings - HOT HOT HOT 2 orders of cracked black pepper calamari - Inhaled 1 order of fried pickles - it was ok 1 order of potato skins - YUMMY 1 order of mac and cheese - it is served with diced ham - the cheese was too creamy for me.  I like cheesy cheese. 1 order of grilled cheese and soup - M said it was GOOD 1 order of korean bbq pork tacos - G said it was very good 1 order of beef kabob - V liked it, I was too full to try  The girls had tons of drinks too.  Great specials on drinks."}
{"text":"The Armadillo Grill seems like a mix between a biker bar and a sports bar. It's almost like a dive bar! But it's a good place to watch games, the drinks, service, and food were all good!"}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I have been here a few times and have enjoyed the experience. However, today I had to wait for over an hour and a half for my food. Not only that, but they also ran out chicken. They were also down a cook which I understand, but they did not tell us that before sitting us. We overheard it from the table behind us. It would have been courteous to mention it before so we could know that we would wait a while or even go someplace else. We received our food which  some of the plates were cold. After all of this we received the bill and there was no discount for the wait or food being cold (which was mentioned). We asked the waitress (she was very nice!) if we could get a discount and she said that she had asked her manager before bringing the check to us. She then said she would go and ask again, which then the manager gave us the discount. This is where I thought it was ridiculous! The manager knew we had waited so long because he had come over a few times apologizing for the wait. I will not be coming here again and recommend to spend your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Their 19th St burger and fries rivals Delux and Smashburger, it's my favorite.  Virginia is my my go to waitress every time.  She sets you up with the hook up.  Fried mozzarella and potato skins as appetizers rock and they have 1/2 off happy hour specials.  Their Mac and cheese rocks as well."}
{"text":"Okay so a sports bar is the LAST place I expect to find mouthwatering deliciousness. But this place is undeniably a must eat. Ive been here a few times and I have never been disappointed, but what prompts me to write about it is the Acapulco Shrimp Quesadillas. They are out of this world, the spicy jalapeno creme sauce is genius! My coworker ordered the pesto pasta and it smelled heavenly. The smell is that smell that even though you're stuffed beyond belief you still want to keep eating because it smells so good smell. Does that make sense.  Other than that its a great place to people watch..off track betting spot.. need I elaborate? You will NOT be disappointed by the food in fact it will trump any bad service experience you may have."}
{"text":"The \"Dillo\" is where it's at if you want a good meal and drink.  Plenty of TVs for sports and horse racing if that is your thing.  Excellent sports bar, friendly staff, good food, and did I mention the drinks?"}
{"text":"Great place to relax after work. Can't find a better place for thirsty Thursday! The apps selection can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time with this place ! Ordered the chicken Parmesan . Literally a pile of frozen chicken with uncooked pasta ! Didn't even take a bite threw it straight in the trash! I've had some bad experiences and bad food but I don't think anything compares to this trash!!"}
{"text":"One of the best values in a happy hour- both food & drink are on the reduced lunch plan.   Fried pickles, ahi tuna salad and several big cold beers for under $30 including tip. Me likey. The fried pickles not the sliced kind you get at Hooters- these are fried whole, and they are worth the trip.  Vibe here is a little dive-ish, and there was a mix of families in the section furthest from the bar, off-track betters & Phoenix hipsters at the bar, and plenty of non-descript folks here on the Friday night I attended. I'm a big fan of a mixed crowd, so I'm also a big fan of Armadillo."}
{"text":"Well, Armadillo Grill, I'm not a fan.  We came here on Wednesday night for an NBA playoff game after reading the reviews touting the great food and the plethora of TVs. I was disappointed with the food and really disappointed with the service. I won't be back.   Our server clearly did not want to be there; she seemed annoyed that we were sat in her section. She didn't know the menu very well, and kept having to (unapologetically) leave the table to run our questions by the other staff.  My boyfriend had the stroganoff and I had a veggie burger. Both plates came out within 10 minutes, which always makes me a little nervous. His was sub par; he ate about 35% of it. The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger. Everything was below average, except for the music, which was just about average.  They played it at a decent volume (thank you), and was probably someone's itunes playlist of hits from the 90s. I'm okay with that.  They do have a decent amount of TVs (though nothing to swoon about in my opinion), however they are small and outdated. Most of the ones near us were staticy. I ended up watching the game from a TV that was half way across the room, the only one in our section of the restaurant with a decent picture."}
{"text":"Great bar and restaurant. The hummus app was very good. I could taste that it was homemade. Great selection of beer, wine and cocktail fixings. My only complaint was the loud obnoxious party of young men next to us who made it nearly impossible to converse. When I nicely asked them to bring it down one if them spoke profanities to me."}
{"text":"I end up craving the Philly cheesesteak with chicken at least once a week. Excellent."}
{"text":"This is my third trip in two weeks because the first trip I had the meatloaf entr√©e and now I'm addicted. I might need a 12 step program to break my habit! This place has a dive bar motif with really good food. I'm hoping to go through the menu but I need a few weeks (or months) to get sick of ordering the same thing over and over. I ordered a beer with my food and it comes in a nice cold glass, excellent!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a bunch of times, food is consistently great.  Best wings in town! I always order the gold wings, also the burger and steak fries are awesome.  Service is great they have a professional attitude and the cheesecake is so good.  This is the place to go eat and watch sports or horse racing.  Solid wifi connection too."}
{"text":"Whoa hold the phone. I didn't know anything about this $1.25 Well Drink special on Thursdays so I will certainly have to revisit this spot.   I have eaten here a few times, as a friend of mine is a big fan of this place, but I just couldn't see it. It felt like he was talking about a girl he thought was attractive and she gets built up and built up and when you finally meet her you have no idea what he was talking about. She isn't ugly, but you probably wouldn't have gone as far as to say she is all that great, either.   Maybe I haven't ordered the right thing, so next time I head in I'll try something new alongside my dollar cocktail."}
{"text":"This sports bar is a hidden gem. Most sports bars are just OK as far as I'm concerned. But this place is AMAZING. Here's why:  Excellent happy hour, and I mean excellent. Delicious food, and they offer lighter options as well. Not just greasy bar food. Their servers are wonderful. There are TV's EVERYWHERE.  I like this place because I can come here with my fiance, have a decent and healthy meal while he watches a game... and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Excellent service, and food, plenty of TVs for whenever you want to watch, great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I pick up food orders from here all the time, and every time I ask for something extra light ranch or salsa this place demands that they charge extra. Normally I am picking up 6 to 7 item orders. They clearly got their money on a large order but apparently the walls will fall down if they give away a ranch or salsa. Places like this are the worse"}
{"text":"Gross carpeting, which I hope has been redone. Not a fan of this place at all. I think they need a good re-vamping, inside and out!!!! Their appearance my be a road block to increasing business. Only here for drinks, therefore I cannot speak on the food."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fantastic food and prices. If your nearby and want a dive bar in the afternoon to try, this is the place to go to. Again, the happy hour prices on drinks and food is what to come for. All the food is good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in the area.  The bar has a good vibe, the food is good, and the bartenders are attentive.  The prices are reasonable so you can have a good time without digging too deeply into your pockets."}
{"text":"Really? Seriously? Sarah L. is the L for Little Pompous? Where is your hood, North Snottsdale? Unbelievable. How can you review a restaurant you didn't even eat at??? from your review you just walked in had a beer, peered down your nose and left.   This is a great little spot tucked away unsuspectingly on Camelback road. They have a great happy hour, pool tables and a surprisingly great menu. I haven't been here in awhile because of the economy the way that it is. But they did have off track betting as well . Not sure if they still do.  The service is good the people are fun and friendly. I like bar food but you can get so much more here.   Some of my Fav's  The herb crusted beef tenderloin is outstanding great cut of meat cooked to perfection.  The Mediterranean stuffed chicken stuffed with artichokes, black olives and feta with a dill sauce and wild rice it is delish!  I am not a big fan of Pesto but their Penne pesto cream is yummy.  Also try the Thai Chicken skewers, Artichoke Croquettes, Louisiana Shrimp, or the Cracked Black pepper Calamari!   This is a restaurant/bar! It's a joint, a neighborhood hang out.   I hate to be rude but geez, you stick to your hood and I'll stick to mine. When you offer a review in the future you should start by saying I rarely go anywhere that doesn't require a 20.00 cover and has a coat check."}
{"text":"Rude staff at bar. If you have a card with a chip, they will announce your card was declined and then insist you need  pull out cash.  Manager came over and realized all was good but not before the bartender made it a point to 'judge'  you 9b their shortcomings."}
{"text":"Upon first impressions, not that impressed. After a few minutes, I'm in love. The bartneders qere amazing, hooking it up with much needed shots and a free beer when he forgot to change the keg. The bartenders love to joke around and it seems like there are a lot of regulars. Always a good sign...  I would give this place five stars if I had the food, they have tomato soup. Alas, I was out with the biggest tool in N Scottsdale and apparenty I didn't deserve a meal with this horrible \"date\" because I wanted to leave so I could watch It's Always Sunny. Best decision of my life!  Also, a warning to all Armadillo employees, I may attempt to steal that big red chest in the Women's bathroom. It may take a few attempts, and I may get arrested, but I have to have it!"}
{"text":"I was debating whether or not to put this as a three or four star. As you can see I out it as four star and that is because the service was on par. Amy was our waitress and she was phenomenal, she knew when to come around and ask us if we needed help or knew when to leave us to our football games. The best part is that they were very accommodating with the Tv's. I hate hate hate going to BWW's and having to fend for myself in a ring of other football fans. This place was small and had more than enough TV's to fit any fan, they best part is that none of them were connected to another Tv meaning if we changed one TV it wouldn't change someone else's game.  I have to say the the selection of food is okay, I wish they had more variety of food. It's the typical wings, burgers, and appetizers....I guess that's all you need for a sports bar...lol but if I could want to change something it would be to add more variety: more salad choices, maybe fruit trays?, or more desserts!!!   The drinks were the regular requests you may want at any typical bar: margaritas, well drinks, and draft beers. I can't complain too much about this bar because how well their service and professionalism was. I would definitely go here again :)"}
{"text":"Ya know...  That familiar beginning is as warm and comfy as is this place.  LET ME 'SPLAIN'  One day, maybe two years ago, I had to go to Discount Tires on Camelback, which is quite literally next door to Armadillo Grille.  That first visit, the food was so bad, I thought I'd written a harsh Yelp! criticizing the food.   I don't even recall what I had but it was not good.   I do recall that while the food disappointed that time, the friendliness of the employees was duly noted.  Last week I happened by and ordered the Happy Hour calamari.  For four dollars!  Best $4 calamari I've ever had and I remember the marinara that came with it was delicious.  Then, last night Armadillo Grille served me a chicken parmesan that was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  I don't mean delicious-for-a-local-pub.  I mean it was fantastic!  I will go back for this dish and perhaps others.  What a great meal!"}
{"text":"Place was nice.  A lot of loyal customers were in there.  Bartender was great.  Made sure out drinks were always coming as we finished one.   He knew just about everyone by name.  The food was only okay but different.  I had the papa-dillos"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a recommendation from a friend, at first I was a little unsure but in the end I was in love! The tuna sliders were my absolute favorite thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Out of a party of 8, one 1 person was satisfied with their food, and one of the people in our party got horrible food poisoning from it. I wouldn't recommend this place or go here again. Our waitress was really great though! We loved her. Everything else was quite subpar."}
{"text":"I think it has to be said that this place is definitely more of an OTB than a restaurant/sports bar.  With that being said, it's not a bad place to grab a drink, get some grub and watch a game.  You might have to fight with the people focused on the horse racing, but it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  This place makes me miss my old neighborhood. My husband and I used to go during happy hour and order tons of food and drinks and get out of there under $30. Our rotation of munchies includes potato skins (sans bacon), hummus, wings, fried mozzarella, and ALWAYS fried pickles. Their fried pickles are soooo good. If you like pickles and fried food, you will LOVE their fried pickles.  Large drafts and wells are reasonably priced. Their bloody marys are probably my favorite in the valley. Ask for a cajun rim!  Service is usually good."}
{"text":"The Armadillo Grill really surprised me. A dive bar in the midst of all the pretentious restaurants and shopping center around the Baltimore area. A resturant / bar with pool tables and a bunch of tv's with sports. I love dive bars, however, I also like when they grow with the times.  I couldn't imagine coming here to watch a game, because despite their large quantity of TV's they are all too small and cheap in quality.   We came on a Monday night late because a friend of ours has been out of town for a month and we wanted to meet up the SECOND she got back. I had the wings, (I'm sure you are shocked). The size and cooking of the chicken was fantastic, however I'm not a big fan when bars use breaded wings instead of grilled.   The ladies got chopped salads which actually looked phenomenal. I def got 'out ordered'.   I probably will only be back if a buddy wants to meet here, but I certainly can't see myself coming up with the idea to meet here for drinks especially in the Biltmore area where there are just so many other better options.   However, I will say that this place probably has that local, consistent customer base where the same people frequent it on the same night of the week. A total cheers atmosphere for sure. So if you are close and live in the area and are looking for \"your dive\"...this'll work."}
{"text":"You definitely feel like you're in a bar here, but the service was wonderful and the food was delicious. They did a great job keeping our glasses of iced tea full. We had the armadillo salad which was fresh and delicious. We also had the brownie dessert and the bread pudding dessert. Both were very good.  I can't say that it is a wonderful place for ambience but the food was good, the portion sizes were appropriate, and the waitress was attentive and timely!  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Best fried pickles - get them Cajun style- and Louisiana Cajun shrimp appetizer....every time I go here I get these two things and service has always been fine and the food has always tasted great...zero complaints!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. The atmosphere is somewhat depressing... And it IS a dive bar, so it's supposed to be dark and dreary and dirty... but when you walk in it's mostly a bunch of older men sitting alone watching the horse races, betting all their money away (this bar offers offsite track betting). The patio is slightly better, but I think it's only due to the fact that you actually get light and fresh air out there.  The food here is what really keeps me coming back... and really only when it's on special. The Armadillo Wings are some of my favorite in the Valley, and the Fried Pickles are by far some of the best I've ever had (order them Cajun style)!!! My advice to all: Go during happy hour! Great prices on beers, wells, and munchies!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing.  The service was attentive.  We had salads and veggie soup.  The soup was flavored very well and the salad fresh.  We will be back."}
{"text":"If you ever want smothered chicken this is the place to go. The sauce on the chicken is 5 star.  They have kids menu. The place has off track betting but they also hAve as side room where families can sit."}
{"text":"Enchiladas were good, not as spicy as I thought they would be with the jalape√±o drizzle. Good service. A true sports bar with horse racing available for those who like the track."}
{"text":"I love this bar.  The waitstaff is friendly and helpful.  There have been times when I have been personally thanked by the management.  This bar is frequented by servers from the surrounding restaurants after they get off work.  That tells me that this bar is good to their customers.  Servers and restaurant staff like to support their industry, when the atmosphere and food is good.  The food is one of the best aspects of this bar.  The hummus is to die for, and their happy hour specials rock.  I also like the \"stimulus menu\", which offers similar food as the full menu, but cheaper prices and smaller portions.  The outdoor patio area is also nice for socializing.  They have misters, which almost make it bearable in the summer.  There is smoking allowed on the patio, which is helpful if you smoke."}
{"text":"Okay...so I kind of cheat. I write about places I've already been to but I'm new to Yelp and trust me, I have a new destination planned out verrrrry shortly.   What can't I say about The Dillo? I've heard about this place for years and have only within the last year or so been in to take it for a test run to see how great (or bad) it could be. It's lived up to the hype.  The Armadillo Grill is misleading. From the outside, it isn't what you would expect. It's a sports bar with class and the food is awesome. My favorite? The fried pickles...such a guilty pleasure but I eat them with ease. The wings are also fantastic and so's the calamari.  The wait-staff are all friendly...every single person I've been served by has been attentive, friendly without being over bearing and sometimes, a big ol' smart ass (specifically Jason the bartender) which is right up my alley.   Any place that has reverse happy hour is a winner in my book seeing as I work late most of the time and rarely get to make that 4-7 slot many places have. And the happy hour is fantastic!   Even when I move closer to downtown, I'll still make my trip up to stop in at The Dillo....you should too!"}
{"text":"Always always have a great time here. The food is fantastic!! Service is great! Love how friendly Brenda the owner is and Virginia is always on point when we get our usual back table! It's my local spot as I love right around the corner! I love all the food because they make almost 90% of it in house. You gotta try some of their dishes like the Mac N Chesse or the Buffalo Chicken Sad/Wrap. Love their ever changing weekly specials!"}
{"text":"After sneaking in to the Biltmore to use their hot tub for 2 hours, we needed a place to grab some food and a drink or two. Of course, it was more for me that we needed a dive-y sort of place as I had no makeup and a baseball hat covering my wet hair. Nico recommended Armadillo's and I was a fan right away. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and prompt with our drinks.   We ordered:  *Wings in Armadillo Gold Sauce- Nico loved them  *Potato Skins- soooo good! Some of the best skins I've ever had  *Hummus and Pita bread- also v good. Pita was warm and toasted perfectly   There were a lot of sports fans glued to the Chargers game and it was a fun atmosphere.  Definatly a place to stop in for cheap food and drinks, with or without looking like a complete scrub."}
{"text":"Good food. Ordered the Pub burger and added jalapenos and onions. The server Christina was real attentive. Would recommend"}
{"text":"We just love this place! Most of the bar staff and waitresses have been there for years and get to know the locals. The food is very good and the menu is diverse. Drink and food specials daily and plenty of tv's to watch the big game. Definitely a Cardinals bar so show some support to our boys over cheap drinks and great food!"}
{"text":"I this place is delicious, ordered the chicken enchiladas and it was amazing! Good came fast and was still hot."}
{"text":"Stopped by for reverse happy hour. A quiet, local bar with a few beers on tap. The fried pickles are definitely one of the best and was worth stopping by for!"}
{"text":"Great place! When we first walked in, I was concerned I had accidentally walked into a strip club because I only saw men, it was dark, and there were tons of sports tvs on. But we were seated in the restaurant area and that was totally normal. I had the Armadillo salad and it was soooo good. The tomato soup was amazing. Great place, awesome food and flavored ice tea. You should definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite recently after shopping. Had been told it was a good place. Entered expecting just another watering hole only to find that they have wonderful food too! Drinks are on special on Sundays (Game Day!!) as are the happy our bites. We had the shrimp tacos, tomato soup and fried mozzarella. All I can say is wow! Tomato soup is creamy and wonderful, shrimp tacos are great and with pretty large shrimp, and the fried cheese, OMG. There must have been a pound of cheese. Think heart attack on a plate, but I survived. They coat this cheese in panko and it is just amazing!!   We saw several other dishes come by, wings which looked and smelled amazing and a meatloaf that look super good. We will return. Don't forget Sunday and Monday are the special priced days."}
{"text":"We order from here at work atleast once a week for 30+ people and i look forward to the Chicken and Brie sandwich.  Last Friday we ordered and when my sandwich was delivered i  couldn't wait to take a bite.  i was so dissapointed when i bit into the sandwich the the chicken was dry and charred. It had been cooked for so long the all tbe brie had melted off the sandwich leaving just  the empty white cheese Rhine. It was dry and terrible. I took two bites and gave up.  the only reason that I gave two stars was because i got a side of onion rings which are always great. If it were not for the onion rings, I would have went hungry .  I'm really bummed and don't know if Iwill even attempt to order my favorite sandwich again for fear  it will be horrible once again. :-("}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Not your typical spot, as it has offsite betting, but had some great quiet lil areas as well. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I met a friend here one time for a big sports game and were not too impressed. There was a strange stench in the bar, the look inside was outdated, and the food and beer was alright. Overall, I would not suggest this place and probably wouldn't go here very often."}
{"text":"Service was good, and food/beer were tasty and reasonably-priced.   There are many nice-sized screens to watch whichever games are on... however, when I was there to watch the Sunday morning NFL games, they were having a very difficult time coordinating the broadcasts. Without warning, my game was switched out with under two minutes to go in the fourth quarter, which was mortifying. At one point, multiple screens were broadcasting a QVC-style infomercial for collectable coins as multiple confused patrons stared on with bafflement.  The reason why this is a four as opposed to a three is a combination of the redeeming products and service quality, and also because the manager was responsive and clearly making a real effort to fix everything. If/when they figure out their technology, this place is a five."}
{"text":"The Armadillo Grill is where it's at for Philly Cheese Steaks! My boyfriend and I have searched high and low through Phoenix seeking out a better Philly and have yet to find it. I mean, it's not the prettiest place but who cares? If you want to relax and get your grub on, do a little off-track betting and drink an ice cold beer, this is your place. We often take family and friends here for a low key yummy dinner and boozin'. The service is always great and you're likely to have the owner stop by and ask you how your meal was. I love that:) It's a big place with a big bar and plenty of TV's. It's easy to miss so keep your eyes peeled!!"}
{"text":"First time at this place and it was really nice, the sign kind of sneeks up on you if your going west on Camelback , but it's all good you can get in the back way.. Prices were great and the food was really good.. Oh and they have off track betting to boot.. The staff was really friendly as well.. It was a good chioce..   I will go back.."}
{"text":"Wifi not working, server and bartender say it's a common occurrence. Shame.  Most TVs are Vizio monitors (not true TVs) and VERY small (22\"?) and NONE are in HD! Further, on a night of NBA playoffs, 90% of the 'TVs' have off-track betting on them instead of sports!! Weird.  Good service at bar. Jimmy is good. But must be forced by mgmt to use a jigger to pour drinks, which is a bit unexpected in a dive bar like this.  Fried cajun pickles are just ok. Kind of tasteless and underdone.  They're using a cheap pickle I think.  This is mainly an off-track betting bar."}
{"text":"Armadillo has some pretty good grub for a bar. I highly recommend the fried green pickles and the smothered chicken.  Happy hour is spot on and they have off track betting. It's a great place to stop in for a few cold ones on a hot summer day.  It's a bit dark and dingy but that only adds to the charm. The servers and bartenders are super friendly. (My boyfriend talked me in to 4 stars for this review, he's a regular)."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I drive about 30 miles to come here as much as possible, we love it. Favorite spot hands down. The food is amazing, never had one bad plate. The happy hour is incredible. Service is always on point. Morgan is such a friendly and attentive bartender, love her! Being a server/bartender myself makes me appreciate all the excellent service you guys give me. Keep up the hard work!"}
{"text":"Nice bar with a full menu and they are open late.  We came on a Saturday night after 11:00 pm and we were still able to order food.  The restaurant wasn't busy but the bar itself has nearly every seat full. They have fried pickle spears, regular and cajun.  A must try!  I had their Papa Dillos last time, loaded mashed potato balls deep fried....they were just okay.  I liked the mellow vibe here and they have an enclosed patio for smoking out front.  It had been awhile since I had been there so I'm not familiar with the food menu and would like to go back to check it out.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"So... I am a little biased, being that I am a former \"Dillo\" AND I met my future husband here.  That being said, I love this place.  The staff is efficient, very friendly and a lot of fun.  The \"Dillo is a neighborhood bar and grill in the Camelback Corridor with a great menu.  They serve your typical bar food, yet better... usually with their own special spin on it.  They also have a very creative lunch and dinner menu and a specials menu that changes weekly to keep you on your toes.    The wings are awesome!  They marinate in a spicy dry rub before frying and the sauce selections are very tasty and all homemade.  My personal favorite was the traditional buffalo sauce but the Armadillo Gold sauce is also very good.  Although it is a tough call, the Hummus & Pita is probably my favorite appetizer.  It is topped with ground cumin and smoked paprika that gives it wonderful flavor.  The best part about the wings, hummus and the rest of the \"Munchie Menu\" is that is is half price between 4-7p AND 11p-close EVERYDAY!  Some of my other favorite menu items are the Buffalo Chicken sandwich (YUM!) and Seared Ahi Tuna salad.  The Penne Pesto Cream is probably one of my favorite pasta dishes EVER.    I can't leave a review with out mentioning the drink specials... Hello drink specials!!  Happy Hour everyday from 4-7 & 11-cl, that means $1 off all well drinks, draft and bottle beers.  Three Olives vodka specials on Mondays and Thursdays ($3.50 or $5 doubles, yum!).  There are many other drink specials you must check out for yourself.  I think I have rambled on enough about my love of the dillo, I moved away and just miss this wonderful little place!"}
{"text":"Always a solid place.  The fish tacos are amazing.  The burger is always solid.  Make sure to get the Thai Chicken Skewers."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Came here for their bday party. Very disappointing. Usually love pasta dishes here. Angel hair with scallops and shrimps was a terrible garlic mess of butter."}
{"text":"What a great find! Had a groupon and this was our first time there. The service and food are great. I had the pasta primavera and hubby had the burger. Excellent food and hubby said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. Nice selection of craft beers and plenty of parking out back. They had the misters going on the semi-enclosed patio and it must not have been too bad as other seemed to be enjoying it. Although we are not into it, they have OTB. Watched the DBacks game instead. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"you couldn't pay me to set foot in this shady place... I tried it a couple of times in 2011 and 2012 and I was surprised that a place like this was still in business, especially given its prime location.    Service was horrible, we were treated like trespassers by the thug behind the bar.  consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Cheap Happy hour specails, Great service, and pool Table... I'm misty eyed allready...  hopeing it would just get better from there... but little power for laptop meetings... Food just OK... and so is this place just OK..."}
{"text":"Ended up here because: 1. It is currently part of the Alaska Dining Miles Plan 2. It had a convenient location 3. It was open late  Didn't expect but got: 1. Fabulous food. The Chicken and Brie sandwich really was. Even if you aren't a huge chicken fan, like me, but a big brie  fan, this sandwich paired with a pear and focaccia bread will hit the spot. The sandwich is filling so Asian slaw as the side was perfect. If you are a big, big eater, you might want the fries. According to others in my party, they were great. 2. A hilarious, attentive waiter. He provided great service and made the meal a truly memorable experience. 3. Trivia night. Who can resist playing? Thanks to Mark H. for running our answers and Nicole H. and John B. for having all the answers (almost).  Great food, great service, fun times!"}
{"text":"The was and amazing Experience Coming here I must say Brenda the owner to Diana Hayley and Kristina was amazing with there service and Customer Service I would highly recommend other yelper come in and Experience a Good Friendly atmosphere here"}
{"text":"This is, as stated above, a sports bar.  I went here for a meeting and the person who planned \"the meeting\" (of four) reserved the back room which is definitely no frills.  It's all the way in the back of the restaurant, so we had to go thru the bar and restaurant and to the room.  I thought we would be forgotten, but we weren't.  Our server, Jordan was very attentive to us--kept our iced tea glasses full and took our order when we all knew what we wanted for lunch.  It's bar food--get a burger and a beer.  Don't expect anything gourmet, because gourmet it's not.  I had the Greek salad with blackened chicken.  It was OK, but my expectations weren't high.  All in all, it's a great bar (but I quit drinking a few years ago, so I'm not into bars).  I wouldn't choose this place, but the person in charge of our group likes it so that's why we were there.  Really no complaints, just not my style."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from the office, and I've gone here with co-workers for lunch many times over the past few months.  The place is okay, and seems to have some serious track betting going on here. Several TV's with horse racing on, machines and some betting tickets and such. I'm not much of a better myself, so I'm not even really sure how it works at this place.  Anyways, I'm kind of torn between two and three stars for this place.  For starters, the inside kind of feels dated, and its always dark when we're there. Also, we usually sit in the back when we are here, since our party size is usually between 6 and 9 people at any given time.  Someone always calls ahead from the office to let them know we're coming in, so they already have the table set up in the back for us when we arrive.  My problem is two fold with Armadillos. First, is that it the service always seems slow, and secondly, they don't seem to have a great lunch menu. It seems to be mostly dinner type dishes, that can be quite big and heavy for the middle of the day.  They have an insert to their menu with \"daily specials\" but nothing that really caters to the lunch crowd.  I mean, sometimes I want a light lunch, not a huge heavy lunch that makes me tired for the rest of the day.  Also, most of the time here it seems to take forever to get our bill, and our food. I know their busy cooking it, but being that they open at 11 AM, and when we arrive we're usually the first people to be in there (aside from a few stragglers at the bar) I wish it wouldn't take so long to get our food.  Plus, we only have an hour for lunch!  One time, it took so long to get our bill, we started getting ansy and tried to hurry out of the place. We have to be back at the office by 12:30, and we didn't get our bills until 12:30!  By the time we all got our change and cards back and left, it was after 12:45, and we didn't get back to the office until 12:50.  We were 20 minutes late back from lunch!  I only go here now because once in a while the ladies from work take me, and its not half bad food. I just wish they had a better lunch time menu and that the service would pick up a bit so we don't spend so much time waiting and paying for our bills."}
{"text":"Crappy club... But an amazing restaurant! Great Happy Hours for food and drinks! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow. This was our first time here and most definitely won't be our last. The service was fun and friendly. The food was wonderful. Chicken, pear & Brie sandwich was superb as was the zesty spinach artichoke dip...best we ever had!"}
{"text":"Lots of TV's so that's good.  Got the fish and chips with slaw and it was so bad.  Fish was overfried and zero flavor.  Fries were overfried.  Slaw was flavorless and browned like it's been in the fridge for a few days.  I tried adding tons of lemon and malt vinegar to save the fish and it didn't work."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best day drinking spots in the valley, especially to watch a game. First of all, the appetizers are just crazy cheap during happy hour, and it way generous portions at that. $3.75 for a plate of decent calamari? Sweet. The same price for a generous portion of hummus and pita? Score! Wash it down with the nice tap selection...they have some four peaks brews, and of course a modest liquor selection that covers he basics.  You can bet on horse races if you have any idea what you're doing. Or you can grab a table and yell at the TV as loud as you want. People here are nice enough to be chill about it. The staff is both kind and prompt. I like."}
{"text":"The Good the Bad and the Ugly  The Good,  Food and friendly sincere service that is available \"late night\" will defiantly earn my 4th star.    The menu is so large that you can very easily miss an entire page. And the food offered is all over the place from meatloaf and cheesesteaks to great dinner items you find in upscale dinning restaurants.    The bad, Drink Specials are tempting enough to go here to get bombed.  If you are a binge drinker or just love great deals, Armadillo Grill is your weekday hook up.   The Ugly, Sorry staff and management I love you guys but pointing fingers does not keep a restaurant  clean.   But it does keep the local dive bar feel alive and I'm ok with that."}
{"text":"My good friend Steve took me to Armadillo grill today for lunch It was my first time and it won't be my last The food is excellently prepared and tasty The service is outstanding I also had the fortunate pleasure of meeting the lovely owner Brenda The prices are good and definitely jusify the food Sports bar with OTB betting neighborhood feel so take my advice and make sure the Armadillo Grill becomes your local and foodie stop"}
{"text":"The Dillo is easily one of the best bars in the Camelback Corridor, with a friendly staff, great drink specials and yummy snacks!   I started going here when I moved into the area, and now I don't mind going anytime of the day! The day bartenders are always super friendly, as are the night bartenders. The food is delicious regardless of when you order it- my favorites are the fried pickles (frickles) and the buffalo mac n' cheese.   If you work in the 16th street area, don't forget to write the name of your establishment on your check so that you can be king of camelback!  Go Aunt Chialda's! ;-)  Love you Dillo!"}
{"text":"Hello Horse Racing Fans!  I thought I made a mistake when I saw off track betting as we were walking in and one table had cheat sheets, racetrack programs, daily racing forms. I was considering becoming a paid public handicapper scratching out a tip sheet on my napkins.  Asian Seared Salmon $10. A 5oz. filet of salmon, seared medium, served over field greens and soba noodles in a soy balsamic vinaigrette.  Herb Crusted Beef Tenderloin $19. A 7oz center cut of beef, double baked mashed potatoes with seasonal veggies, mushroom gravy and topped with onion rings.  Both meals were really good. Had an enjoyable martini too."}
{"text":"top shelf indeed. great ambiance for eating and watching various sporting events on their tv screens. employees are amicable and flexible towards customers. neighborhood also enhances our favorite sports bar and grill in phoenix."}
{"text":"I love this bar! The bartenders are awesome a lot of regulars here and I can see why it's easy to become one everyone is really nice. I went there with my roommate and about three times and they welcome us like we've been going for years.As far as the food I've really only had the fried pickles which are amazing! They have great drink specials and reverse happy hour. I haven't made it to happy hour yet because I'm scared I will stay there until close.The inside is nothing fancy but, enough bar games to keep you entertained."}
{"text":"I am going to give 4 stars for our first time there. The servers were really nice and the food was surprisingly good for a bar. They have the standard burgers and appetizers, but they also had wraps, soups, salads, pasta and deserts. I was shocked with the choices they had.   We went as a large group so food was a little slow coming out, but worth the wait. I will absolutely go back there."}
{"text":"A cool neighborhood hang-out, that one can stop by for a after-work drink, a quick dinner or a night of fun, great service, a non-pretentious place, that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this place with UberEATS and it was such amazing delicious food! I will definitely be dining in at this restaurant in the future... Also get the Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese.... It's to die for!"}
{"text":"The food sucks... don't order the fried pickles, ever!  It's a total dive... don't sit down in the restrooms, ever!  The bartenders are good, the games are fun, and they have pool. What more can you ask for? I've been here a hundred times after work, and there is always something going on. It's definitely an \"industry\" bar if you know what I mean... always full of bartenders, waiters, and hotel people. We go here because it's cheap, a good place to wind down after work, and they have golden tee."}
{"text":"Restaurant was alright, food was very good but they didn't put on the Seahawks game for us that we had asked for numerous times, and were interrupted a number of times while trying to watch the very intense football game, while feeling rushed to pay and leave rather than stay and relax like i thought friendly neighborhood restaurant environments should be, guess I thought wrong."}
{"text":"I suppose I'm biased since I consider this my \"pub\".  It's within stumbling distance from my home. I frequently stumble over there and back several times a week.  I think everyone should have a pub. It's like a living room away from home. The Armadillo has the requisite multiple TV's,, happy hour specials, pool tables, and an interesting assortment of Runyonesque characters who come and go. It's the closest thing to a dive you'll find in that section of the Camelback Corridor, and I mean that in the best and most enthusiastic sense. I love dives.  The munchies menu (discounted during happy hours and all-day Monday) includes several appetizers, including fried pickles, a very decorative hummus plate, and some of the best wings in the valley (try the Armadillo or Honey-Hot). Drink prices are good, and they have specials like \"PBR power hour\" (one dollar Pabst Blue Ribbon beers for you culturally-impoverished sorts).  Again, hard for me to objective, but it' a definite favorite that I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Was looking for a dinner spot with 2 things- wings & baseball. Arrived and sat at the bar, was greeted with great service from Morgan. We really enjoyed the food, particularly the wings! If you like them crispy like me, I'd ask them to cook twice. They come out perfect. Good drinks & lots of tvs for sports games!"}
{"text":"When we hit this bar last Tuesday night, which is a Trivia Night, the whole place was rocking and hopping. Unfortunately we arrived half way through round one so we didn't have much of a chance of winning.   I ordered a vanilla porter on tap from the Breckenridge Brewery and it was phenomenal. If you come here to eat and you like dark beer, you absolutely must try this.  The waiter, whose name was JW, made the overall dining experience a total blast. He anticipated our every wish and was very entertaining as he made our dining experience memorable!  So, we actually went for the food because we were starving. Two of the group ordered the chicken and Brie sandwich, which was very tasty (according to those who ate it), and two of us ordered the sriracha burger, which was scrumptious. The jalape√±o peppers gave the burger the added oomph to render it sublimely tasty as well as spicy.  The sports bar has something for everyone, including two happy hours every day, a pool table, a couple of video game machines, a full bar, outdoor seating, free parking, incredible food and marvelous service. What more could you want? Definitely worth every dollar we spent and earns a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I just ate the biggest man sandwich ever. Picture chicken wings in a burger. Picture a humongous chicken patty with melted cheddar cheese on top of it. Now magnify it to be as big as your face. Yeah, that's basically what the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is! I wish I could put emoji's in my review because dipped in ranch this sandwich is a mouthful of all things that you need when you're watching sports: a large amount of breaded meat doused in cheese, slapped with a few vegetables and ready for sauce dipping and consumption. The onion rings were equally as large and in charge. For the record, I did not eat the entire thing in one sitting, and even a normal sized guy with a large stomach will have to throw down on this Man vs. Food sized sandwich. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great service.  Super nice employees.  TV's for games.  Off track betting.  The only thing that could make this place better are the prices.  A bit expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Was recommended tp me to try by a co-worker.  Had a \"eh\" experience.  An \"eh\" experience is what you say when recommending the establishment to someone else.  And that sums up my experience.  Service had a rocky start...my friend started a tab before I got there and I sat for 15 min waiting for a server before I went to the bar.  Five minutes later a different server came over and had taken over our tab.  So problem solved.  We had a couple of the 1/2 price apps.  They were good - calamari and potato skins.  Pretty standard stuff.    Overall, I'll go back for some HH specials but I'm not going to be the one suggesting it to people.  I'll stay up by 16th and Bethany Home instead."}
{"text":"Went here for a post graduation celebration after making reservations. Everything was ready when we got there, no waiting. Staff was great and service was excellent!!! Everyone loved the food they ordered! Would highly recommend this place for any event!"}
{"text":"Do not let the outside appearance of this place fool you in anyway! It's an older building but I have been coming here for two years now and the people and service are always SPOT ON! It's more of a locals secret I think and here's why: THE FOOD! If you are in the mood for \"something healthy\" go somewhere else...but we are Americans and this food while not the healthiest, it's just damn good! Never had a bad menu item here but like others I have my favs. To start either the fried pickles Cajun style, or the pappadillos (whoever made this invention should get an award for tasty)...hands down the buffalo Mac n Cheese if you want hearty, and as simple as it sounds their grilled cheese and tomato soup will always be my go to! Great atmosphere and food and super reasonable on their prices. I love LOVE love this place!"}
{"text":"Nice slightly divey atmosphere with good music and amazing steak and cheese's. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was dissapointing to me. I was excited based on the reviews but wasn't pleased with the food. I ordered a ceasar salad and the dressing was almost slimy. That is the only way I can describe it.  My date ordered a philly cheese steak sandwich that was awful. It tasted like pure salt. Maybe we got the wrong items? The server was nice but pretty pushy on us getting alcohol. The prices were great on the drinks but the margarita was an awful choice. It was bad. The long island ice tea wasn't terrible but I guess this is just a place to go for cheap drinks and medium food. I would prefer going to Chili's over this place. Sorry Armadillo Grill. I wanted to love you."}
{"text":"So last night I experienced the Armadillo for the first time.  I honestly wasn't impressed from the amount of good and great reviews I've seen.   As a sports bar they have plenty of tv's and the game audio on which is nice.  There is not much good seating around the restaurant so eat at the bar if you can.    The food was just ok.  I had the Louisiana shrimp.  I don't know how they can call them Louisiana shrimp because everytime I've had BBQ shrimp in New Orleans they are good size shrimp.  These were tiny little shrimp drowned in sauce.  The sauce however was good and there is plenty of bread to scoop it up and eat it with.    They have several beer options which is nice and a full bar for mixed drinks and shots.    If you just are looking for a divish type bar to watch the game at with just decent food then this would be a good spot but there are many options of places like that I feel have way better food.   2.5/5"}
{"text":"What a great bar and grill!  Everytime, I would get the Salmon (love the citrus sauce).  It's prepared just right!  The service is always fast and friendly!   A must try!"}
{"text":"First time to Armadillo Grill and I was pleasantly surprised. Based on other people's reviews, I was expecting a dingy, dark dive bar. This is just not the case! I think many people simply have never been to a real dive before. The area surrounding the bar was dimly lit, but that's a good thing! It looked pretty awesome in there actually, and the pool tables were in a separate area in the back. We sat in the other separate area with booths which was brighter and gave it a quieter, more restaurant feel (even the bar area was NOT that loud).  I have to agree with everyone's love of the fried pickles. Went with the original kind. I think they dip them in panko after the batter, super crunchy and delicious. I forced my roommate to try one bite with ranch dressing (he HATES pickles), but he actually couldn't seem to stop taking more bites. Pretty funny! I ordered the salmon in parchment special for $9.99. While it was good, it was not great. It tasted like the salmon I buy (and cook myself) from Costco. A little chewy on the teeth, but hey, it's 9.99! It came with green beans, broccoli and carrots which were really well prepared with garlic. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed cooked veggies so much. There was wild rice pilaf as well. Tasted like the kind I used to buy in small boxes at the store. That's not a complaint, it's good. My roommate ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which he liked very much.  I think we were supposed to get the pickles at half price since we ordered at 6:45, but were charged full price. It didn't matter this time since we were using a Groupon and were a little short using the whole thing anyway, just something to note. Service was a little slow at times, but not enough to make us upset, we weren't in a hurry. Besides, everyone there was VERY friendly, even the servers that we only saw in passing smiled and said hello. That's pretty rare, especially in Phoenix (I'm a native, I can say it)!  Overall, I would definitely come back. I like the atmosphere, people, food and prices. Just wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"The Armadillo Grill on Thursdays.  Great appetizers and drink specials.  And it's kind of nice to sit at a table away from the bar & still get the bar specials! The grilled cheese is SO yummy, especially when you get a small side of their tomato soup to dip it in.  Good food, service and specials.  And they support other local businesses- which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"In my opinion Some of the best bar food in town. They remodeled not too long ago (2017) so it's a little nicer inside now too."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The tomato soup/ grilled cheese combo is delicious, the pasta is very tasty,  the burgers are fabulous. The house merlot is perfect, not too heavy, and very yummy. The iced tea is generous and refershing, and they make a great black and tan. If they would make the fried pickles as discs,  I think they would be better,  but they're good as is,  too. Today i had the spinach artichoke dip. It comes with addictive, crispy pita bread and great tortilla chips. The dip itself is spicy with jalape√±o,  but not too much so (says the girl from Michigan).  It tasted like someone here at Armadillo Grill made it. The appetizer comes with a small portion of chunky, tasty salsa. Yum!  I'm not sure you can go wrong here,  but trust me, do try the tomato soup.  Seriously stellar!!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar food and drink.  But they do have a thing where you can bet on the horse races?  Cash only I think."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots for years. The food is amazing and not what you would expect from a \"sports bar\". Most of the staff has been there for years, some over a decade. I think that alone speaks for Armadillo as a establishment. The owner is often seen serving and helping out which is rare these days.  They have Trivia nights, horse race betting and several TV's going to keep you entertained. Don't be deceived by calling themselves a sports grill. Their food is some of the best in the area. Add them on Facebook and check out their daily drink specials. Hats off to Armadillo Grill for staying great over the years."}
{"text":"I came back to Armadillo a few times and had good service.   The owner or manager took the time to respond to my prior review, and that's pretty cool, unlike most of the fuckheads running bars in the city.  It's not Hanratty's, but whatever."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from outside, but the food is gourmet and delicious. I've tried many things on the menu and liked all of it. My favorite thing by far is the buffalo chicken sandwich. Pay the extra to get it with onion rings. My parents always request to go here when they are in town visiting. Great place to watch games and not get your typical bar food. They would get 5 stars if they had better service. Nothing terrible, but have to wait awhile sometimes."}
{"text":"Solid, repeat: solid. I don't make it here that often, but when I do it's always rewarding. The most recent visit I had the buffalo chicken mac n cheese at the suggestion of our server. It was certainly not a healthy dish, but it was delicious. Every time I eat here I'm pleasantly surprised that it's not run-of-the-mill bar fare. Whoever they've got in the kitchen is putting thought into the product and it shows.   The atmosphere is rad. It's one part bar, one part restaurant from a decade or two ago, and part OTB. To sum it up - unique. And that's what I like. The service has never been an issue and I will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"When you go, get the Thai sticks as an appetizer! What I really love about this place?  The races!  While I don't gamble, it's rare to go to a clean, classy place and see races.   The menu is vast.  I like the hummus platter:  surrounded by slices of cucumber and other fresh veggies.  The hummus has a bit of a kick, which is how I make it when I actually have the time. My servers are always super-friendly and have an awesome sense of humor! Service is quick, too!"}
{"text":"The tuna salad looked sooo delicious in pictures but it tasted HORRIBLE. Wings were badly seasoned and fried pickles were sad. The only things we enjoyed were our drinks and the artichoke dip. Everything else was bland, overpriced, and came in sloppy portions. Definitely not returning. I wanted to give 1 star but they were nice enough to take the salad off the bill since we hated it after one bite."}
{"text":"Good bar food.  We had buffalo wings and they were ok.burger and fries and pulled pork sandwich were very good.  The fries were excellent. Happy Hour on weekends!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had a tasty Philly quesadilla. This bar and grill is well located in a shopping area, and hosts some of the friendliest staff in town. And, the bar is stylish without the aristocratic vibe that permeates Arcadia."}
{"text":"Legit spot.... Tenders here are one of my go to local meals... Ten bucks generous portion and doesn't taste frozen at all because they bread it in house"}
{"text":"I'm so torn about this. I think this place just needs a revamp. Went in for dinner tonight, got seated right away, greeted right away and thought service was fantastic throughout dinner. We had the fried pickles, eh...the Cajun spices pepped them up a little but nothing special. They were in spears so a little harder to eat than chips. Calamari was delicious. Perfectly cooked, sauce was great. Ceaser salad was decent. Server told me they were known for their soup so i tried it and it was very good but nothing to it. I had the special chicken cordon bleu with jalapeno cream sauce. I found the flavors really didn't jibe. Thin chicken breast, ham, Swiss and then drowned in this sauce. Maybe a mustard sauce would be better? Mashed potatoes were bland and the broccoli was bland. The chicken with the mushroom sauce was better. The little guy had chicken strips but were actually overcooked, mostly breaded chicken chunks. He ate all the fruit though. They were out of the brownie so we opted to share the black forest cheesecake which was good but the sauce had marachino cherries on it. You know? The bar cherries. The prices were reasonable and the service was  bomb. This menu needs some help...."}
{"text":"4-stars for this simple reason: it's low key and unpretentious. Whether it's Tuesday or Saturday, there's room for you. It may not be at the bar, but there's room. I prefer this place on a weekday. Sit at the bar, watch the TV, drink the specials and chat with the bartenders. Or, play darts on modern-day dart machines. It's comical to play Cricket in space, or with balloons. If that doesn't fancy you, play it straight. Or meander to the pool tables and hit some balls around. Or, if you need some fresh air, step outside on the patio... Most often you'll see a red/blue flashing light show. Fun times.   It's not the easiest place to find if you don't know what you're looking for. I think the large strip mall across the street distracts you while you're driving. But, turn your gaze to the north side of the street and look closely for this hidden gem. Stopping in for a drink or two is definitely well worth it."}
{"text":"Right down the street from maizies this is a great place to end your Monday night. I haven't experienced the food because I was always stuffed after the burger ar Maizies. But this is a great Monday spot because you don't pay for pool!  There are a lot of locals who frequent here, I would guess more on Monday. That's very much a guess because its the only day I went! You know what happens when you assume though...  Anyhow! It's very low key with great prices on drinks! Bar tenders are happy to give up suggestions when you're ready for something new. This is nice when you're as indecisive as myself.  They have loads of games besides pool. Darts, touch screen, etc. You will NOT be bored! (:  The patio is a tad small and on a main road, but that's ok I was always too busy inside on the games to notice.   I like this place because the people and bar remind me of the east coast in a way. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch today and because of vegegirly C.'s review about the deep fried pickles guess what we ordered??? OMG they were amazing! We ordered the cajun style and man oh man were they goooooood! We have never even heard of them but I am so glad we got them. So crispy and so hot! Mmmmm (and 1/2 priced)!!!  We got greeted and seated quickly. I ordered the chicken brie sandwhich and my husband had the meatloaf sandwhich. I am not sure where the comment about small portions came from because they were good sized and we were both stuffed!  The only change to the chicken brie would be to have the pears sliced thinner rather than having thick pears to bite through. Otherwise it was yummy.  I also ordered the \"Arizona Iced Tea\" for the first time since they didn't have fresh mint to make my mojito. I was pleasantly surprised at how light and refreshing it was.  We had the entertainment card which they didn't punch so we can use it again, and we will :)"}
{"text":"Just what I was looking for! A spot in front of the TV to watch the Kings, a good appetizer and salad, and a nice server that leaves you alone....until you need something!...5 stars on all counts. I was by myself and felt comfortable and felt I got a good meal at a very reasonable cost!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! Typically I go to Armadillo after work for a meal and cold beer. I normally get the Chicken Parmesan and substitute the marinara with the Pesto Cream sauce. I few cents extra but totally worth it.  The Mozzarella appetizer is fantastic too - 1/2 during happy hour. They freshly make these from scratch each time. The service is fantastic too. Normally I sit at the bar and order food and the bartenders have always been great.   It can be a little difficult to get to the parking lot from Camelback during rush hour, but it's not terrible. Highly recommended place to visit!"}
{"text":"We dined here on Friday evening, restaurant was about 40% occupied.  I ordered the beef stroganoff with the garlic bread and my companion had the Chicken and Brie sandwich.  The chicken sandwich was good, the thick steak fries were hot and nicely crispy on the outside. The beef stroganoff was bland, the meat texture was not tender as the dish traditionally should be. The garlic bread sadly made me choke as the chunks of garlic were so overpowering. The service was not attentive.  Had to request refills on our drinks.  100 plus temperatures in Arizona in summer would make you think this would be a priority in restaurants. The waitress did not remove our dinner plates, even when we both indicated we were finished. Not impressed"}
{"text":"We ate here again on 4/20/13- great service again and they have the best fried pickles ever!!!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Hesitated to go here because the Armadillo in Colorado we love serves Mexican food not \"American Grill\". But we gave it a shot and were so happy we did. Our waitress, Virginia, was super nice and helpful. She said she had been there something like 12 of the 17 years they've been open. That's impressive. The food was fabulous... minus the chocolate cherry cheesecake (I just thought it'd be full of sweet black cherries not maraschino cherries- just a personal preference). But Virginia brought the cheesecake out with a special candle for my husbands birthday and that was a nice touch without making a birthday scene!) The buffalo chicken sandwich, Asian slaw and teriyaki chicken kebabs were especially good. Lots of TVs to see whatever sport you'd like and not too dark for a bar with all the windows. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place isn't good. The beer selection is okay, but the food tastes like they just microwave everything. I can't bring myself to try the wings b/c the waitress described them as, \"Some people like them.\" It also smells like it was recently flooded.  I had a salad once, and it was actually good. The steak fries are good (but frozen).  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Eaten there several times, haven't had anything I didn't think was pretty darn good. Somehow we always get the same waitress too, whichi is pretty cool, she is helpful and really friendly!"}
