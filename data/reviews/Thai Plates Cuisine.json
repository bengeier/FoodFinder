{"text":"Been here multiple times now and I can say it is probably the best Thai food in town. Try the massaman curry or pad see ewe. Many other yummy things on the menu too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! Understanding that Thai food can be sweet, it seems that most Thai joints in AZ are overly sweet. We found this spot after an afternoon at a pumpkin patch and found out the owner of this establishment had a shop in Hollywood, CA. Reminded us of home!

As others have stated, it's a hole in the wall, but the food is excellent and well worth the drive.

Stop in and try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had the Basil lunch special and Basil Fried Rice, great flavor, nice family owned restaurant. Will be back"}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent staff, appetizers we're delivered quickly and drinks were never less than half full. Would return again!"}
{"text":"If I could write a whole book about this restaurant I would. To cut it short, I have to say this is the hands down the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to. I have been to many Thai restaurants in different states and cities and this one is #1. I have ordered many different items on the menu and they have all overly exceeded my expectations. I have never left upset or hungry. Their portions are extremely generous and the taste is phenomenal. You get a lot more than what you pay for. Their average prices are on the low side and the quality is amazing. If you get a chance to eat here, I recommend the pan fried noodles with chicken. I have tried this entree in many different restaurants and none have came this close. Also, their orange chicken is the best and most authentic tasting I have ever had. It tastes so fresh and they actually bread their orange chicken the day of. You will not be disappointed coming here to eat especially with a big group of people. If you come in, mention this review to them and you will make them smile."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.its a very home feeling kinda restraunt.there lunch special is awesome. My favs are the Orange chicken and the tum yum soup.and if your looking for something sweet the coconut ice cream is definitely something to try!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai I have found in Mesa.  We had a variety of things off the menu, from appetizers to curry to stir-fry. All were excellent and portions were generous!  Good water (not that awful tasting city water) was a nice bonus.  Friendly service, too.  Will definitely be a repeat customer.  Probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is so Incredible! I drive all the way from Tucson to eat here. The owners are so sweet. I love this place"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor, quality, and presentation!
Dinner for 2 under $20, what else can I say!?  
Get over there as fast as you can!

Best Thai food I have experienced."}
{"text":"Delicious potstickers! Green curry and spicy basil are amazing!! Service is quick and friendly! Best Thai food in Mesa!!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  The Thai food flavors are authentic and the service is great.  The take care to season your order the way you like so even you Mother-in-Law doesn't complain about the spice.  However, if you like it hot...they can deliver.  This is our favorite Thai place.  For sure."}
{"text":"Not sure what the 3 1/2 star post was talking about, regarding expensive.  We have tried every Thai place in the area and this is by far the best value, $7.95 lunch combos and the best flavor in town.  We enjoy eating here 3-4 times a week and are amazed that everything on the menu is fantastic.  Family operated with pride.  We lived in Thailand for a month and find the Thai Plate to be authentic fresh delightful Thai cuisine, it's Bangkok brought fresh to Mesa.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I don't even like Thai food but my brother convinced me to go, and I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This Thai joint is probably one of the best I've been to. Their Pad Thai and Fried Rice are my personal favorites. Their staff members are nice and hard working. The food doesn't take too long to arrive too. Even though the food comes out fast, it's still very delicious. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"Had the pumpkin curry and the pad kee mao.  Soo good.  If you're not a big fan of spicy, get the dishes mild.  They definitely have a bit of heat even when ordered mild.  We also had the mango sticky rice and the custard which were both excellent!!  And don't miss the Thai iced coffee. 
This restaurant may be new but the owner's family has been in the restaurant business for decades and it really shows.  Great food, great service.  Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Thai Plates is the best Thai food restaurant in the east valley.The food is very good, very flavorful and the customer service is great.So far every dish I tried has been on point.If you want great Thai food this is the place"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I have had.  Potstickers were outstanding as was the spicy noodles."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Quaint atmosphere and excellent service.   I had the orange chicken and it was perfect!   Prices are really good as well!  One if my favorite places to eat!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been trying to make it to all of the Thai restaurants in the area, and glad we made it to Thai Plates! The food was great, we ordered pad thai, phad see ew, and yellow curry family style. Food came out quickly and the staff is quite nice! Restaurant itself could use a little bit of updating, but the size is better than others we have been to. 4 stars overall :)"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall immediately adjacent to an Albertsons market, the decor is tastefully neat and clean. The proprietors are welcoming and engaging evidencing an eagerness to be genuinely friendly and appropriately social. The food (mine pad gra prao and hers the Massamun curry) were tasty, nicely presented and filling. Lunch entres came with salad and egg rolls, both excellent. Some of the ingredients were obviously home grown so of great quality and freshness."}
{"text":"Have ordered take-out here a few times...but today was the first time for dining in.

The first thing to note is that no one is overly friendly.  They're not rude...but don't expect any small talk.

We were greeted by \"how many?\"...and then simply waved to a nearby table.  A family came in after us and one of the men was in good spirits and said with a big smile on his face, \"Long time no see.\" The host just intoned, \"How many?\" and acted just like he had to us.

OK...so you're not going to Thai Plates to make friends it seems.

We each ordered our new \"go-to\" Thai meal: Spicy Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) w/ chicken (called Drunken Noodles at many places - with basil and vegetables).

As I've written in many reviews we like hot foods and ordered it Hot...but they offer Extra Hot and several levels of Thai Hot.  Next time we'll both try the Extra Hot...because while the Hot was ok...we like a bit more scorch to our taste buds.  : )

Otherwise everything was fresh and cooked just right.  The chicken was tender and there were many large pieces. I thought there were far fewer vegetables than you'd find at other Thai places and missed that though.

The price is pretty good at $8.50 for the entree...but for that you get a bit of a smaller portion.  I had a Thai tea which was ok...but I like mine a little stronger and sweeter.  Like a lot of smaller Thai restaurants they only offer soda in a can for a dollar.

Over-all we thought it was pretty good and would definitely go back.

BTW...we got there after they just opened at 11am on a Monday...and by 12:30 every seat in the place was filled...so a lot of people must really like it here."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, food looks like it came from a box. Not impressed at all. Food was cold and not fresh. Dont waste your money."}
{"text":"Have eaten there more then a few times now, wife & I always start out with the fresh spring roll:)  food is always very good everything I've tried tasted fresh and came out quick & hot. I'm no expert on Thai cuisine but for my taste and compared to all the other Thai food I've had in the area this one is my favorite. Dinning room is very clean as is the rest room. Although it's time to get the booths re-padded or replaced not to comfortable, but other then that I\"m a fan!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for great Thai food, this is the place. I had the Red Curry, chicken Larb, and Papaya salad. They were all awesome! I've eaten at many Thai restaurants in Arizona, California, and Oregon. This place knows Thai without being over priced or skimpy on portions. Try it, and you'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I have been to every Thai restaurant in this vicinity and this is, without doubt, the best place I have eaten at in a long time, and definitely the best Thai. This is my 3rd time here this week! I'll keep coming back too."}
{"text":"That was awesome! I had the broccoli lovers with beef and it was incredibly good. The oyster sauce is a perfect blend of savory with just the right kick of spice. Also had the Tom Yum, which has a great base with a generous fill of shrimp, mushrooms and more. The staff was very friendly and helpful. 
Great meal with low prices."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Love this place. Does get busy at the usual meal times and the place is small so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai and awesome value! We are vegetarian and our dietary requirements were met with extra tofu and fresh vegetables! Highly recommend the red curry and spicy noodles,'be sure to have them hot!"}
{"text":"This is THE go-to place for Thai food. The Pad Thai and Beef Salad are so freakin good and should not be missed. Say hi to Tommy who runs the place. One of the nicest and most mellow owners around."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Great service very helpful ordering the right entre. The flavor of everything was fabulous. I highly recommend this restaurant. Wish they had alcohol but no big deal the food out ways the drink"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly personable service, clean. Had the chicken Pad See Ew, it was very good, but the noodles were a little longer and more stuck together than I am used to. Didn't stop me from devouring the whole massive portion though. Broccoli was al dente!!! Mmm..."}
{"text":"I've eaten many different dishes and everything was really good. The owner was very nice and helpful on what to order. Definitely found a new place to eat Thai food!"}
{"text":"Hungry for Thai food and found this little quaint restaurant Saturday night. I was thoroughly impressed with the flavorful pineapple fried rice, pad Thai and delicious yellow curry. The owners are very nice and friendly and I definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"Been there three times. The first two, the food was quite good but the service was very slow and mediocre. After the last time I ate there, September 10, 2015, I woke up early the next morning and vomited Massaman Chicken for the next 4 hours. Am I sure it was the food?  Hmmmm, not positive, but pretty sure, and I know I'll never eat there again!"}
{"text":"I loved the lettuce wraps with fried tofu and peanut dipping sauce. I also tried the green curry with fried tofu which was amazing but I wish I asked for them to tone down the spicy a bit because I had to eat it very slow."}
{"text":"I would probably gove this place more like 3.5 stars, but it feels more like 4 than 3.  Strong lineup of Thai and Chinese dishes here, very good.  The Thai iced tea and the Thai coffee were excellent."}
{"text":"We've dined there many times. Food is always excellent and service is great.  It is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm not a Thai kinda guy, but my son goes to school with the owners son.  The dish I got was super flavorful.  I love this place.  Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My reviews are few and far between. I choose carefully where and when to share my experience because frankly, I am not easily impressed. I have a high standard and feel that great experience should be the first stepping stone in any business venture. So, if an establishment exceeds my expectations and reaches the height of excellence, I feel compelled to spend my most precious resource, time, to tell others about it. Thai Plates Cuisine has earned my respect and my business time and time again. Their food quality and selection is superior to all of their competitors in the area. They use their ingredients in colorful and creative ways, which result in great meals that keep me coming back for more. If you have not experienced the Thai Plates Cuisine, then you probably can't imagine what great Thai food tastes like."}
{"text":"I arrived as green to Thai food as anyone. The manager or owner was extremely congenial and helpful. He helped get me a just right plate of food with just enough spicy-ness as needed.
Now for the drink... I love coffee. If you never have tried Thai coffee then I highly recommend this. Before buying it he gave me a generous sample. And I had to have more! 12 or 16 ounces of Java yumminess for $2.00!!! 
This place deserves its 5 stars."}
{"text":"They hit it out of the park tonight for take out.  We loved the food.  Ordered Pad Thai, Orange Chicken, Papaya salad and Potstickers.  We are from NYC. Very good. Just discovered this place tonight. So proud of my Mesa hood new Thai go to restaurant! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Never dissatisfied with this place. They are super friendly and never mess up the order. Ate in and had take out numerous times. Usually get the pad Thai and Thai fried rice-- delicious every time! The flavors are just -KAPOW!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Thai but I let my wife drag me to Thai Plates and I was pleasantly surprised. We had fries wontons to start and they were tasty. I ordered the pad see eiw with beef and it was stellar. I would come here again without being dragged."}
{"text":"I've tried just about everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointing.  Great food, good prices and incredible service.  I'll be back, often."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Party of two. We each ordered appetizers, veg rolls were hot crispy and tasted OK... the other person's appetizer, satay,  appeared 15 minutes later. They were hot and tasted as though they had been marinaded in coconut milk. The peanut sauce was good as was the small serving of cucumber salad which accompanied the chicken satay. One entre appeared... calamari salad, the calamari was reasonably tender, spicy and was a good sized portion. My guest's entre ($6.95 lunch special) appeared about 15 minutes later... I tucked into my salad and was nearly finished before his lunch arrived... sweet and sour chicken,  (pretty much Chinese buffet style stuff...completely unremarkable). If you are going with a group (or more than one) at lunch and want to be served at the same time I suggest sticking to the specials.  One hot tea, one iced tea. Total: $34 plus tip. OK, but not a place I would go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"So good and fast and friendly. Would definitely come back!! Presentation was beautiful also."}
{"text":"The service very nice and the food is authentic
Tom yum soup hot both waystemp and spiceoff the chartsI had the big bowl with glass noodles, appetizers so good fried wontons, coconut soup sweet and sour chicken really good and the price was what it should be!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Had the coconut soup which was great, glass noodle salad had lots of fresh vegetables and the pumpkin in the curry was delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff! Highly recommended! Thank you for a wonderful experience from Charleston SC."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great service!  Great food!

We found this place on Yelp.  It lives up to our expectations.  It is a small mom and pop place.  

With food and service like this, it won't stay small long."}
{"text":"Great food very nice service. Will go back again. Had the orange chicken and my husband had the pad Thai. Yummy"}
{"text":"Best fried rice on the planet. It's a must try, actually everything is amazing I've tried so far. Green curry, fried rice, Tom yum soup and pat Thai"}
{"text":"My sister and I visited a week ago during lunch hour. I looked over and thought man I hope that tv doesn't fall off the wall and then my sister pointed up because I was sitting directly under one. It's not a flat screen but one of those they would strap to a cart and roll into the classroom but bigger! 

Okay so this is yelp I'm suppose to tell you about food. 

I had the green curry with noodles. It was so good. So good that a week later I'm craving it. The coconut and green curry infused broth with chunks of white chicken breast or your choice of protein served in a huge bowl with what I believe is a ramen noodle. 

We also had fried tofu. Supple and soft tofu w a crispy fried crumb exterior. Sooooo good. 

Their service was good at first but then they got busy and were running out of tables to seat customers and I could tell they were frantic. 

There was a group there I'm guessing either from the college or hospital that were sorta rushed out. They bussed the tables before they even were fully standing up but they were using a good 3 tables for their group that was camping out. 

Anyway I still give them 5 stars bc my experience and my food was good. 

What would I change? The tvs need to go."}
{"text":"The food the delicious and the service was great. I was a little disappointed that the only curry that didn't have fish was the yellow but it was savory and just what I craved."}
{"text":"I must say for my first time being here, I was kind of worried due to the location and how small the place is. HOWEVER it is amazing! I tried their orange chicken which was very lean and crunchy, along with various curries and soups which all were amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone including families, as the owners appear to also be highly family oriented.

If you are going here I would try their curries, it's hard to find a good place that offers a variety and that are let alone good, but this place is one of them."}
{"text":"Ok, the hype on this place is right on. It's not a trendy, upscale, posh place but the food is on target. When you can make Pad See Lew this good. You got it going on baby doll. It's a family run business that has the son as a cashier. I kinda like it though. We need more family run businesses out there. Friday night and the place is full which is always a good sign. Sometimes you find hidden gems and this is one of those times. I give it 5 enfuego peppers! Which is a rare thing because very few places get my stamp of approval."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego, so I'm used to amazing Thai food, but Thai Plates had some very nice selections at decent pricing."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the East valley, my wife lived in Thailand and I've went there when I was in the Navy. It's awesome."}
{"text":"BEST Coconut (Tom Kha) soup I've ever had. Affordable, great service. A hidden GEM! We just moved to Mesa, wanted something fast and this was the place! Will definitely be back. Got the Pad Thai mild, perfect choice! This is a must stop if you want some great food! They also have a large variety of healthy options. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"I love it when there is a new Thai restaurant near my house. This place has very generous portions, so much I couldn't over-indulge (and clean my plate) like I normally do, so I get to have some for lunch tomorrow. That makes me happy! Pad Thai is spot on! (I always try a new places Pad Thai, I consider it one of the litmus tests for Thai cuisine). The Spring Rolls in rice paper just like I like with a nice sweet sauce to dip them in and the same for the egg rolls with a good sauce. They gave me 5 egg rolls! I love that! Great flavor. And the spring roll had a couple nice BIG shrimp!

Don't be surprised if you see me here again, I'll be the Duke in no time!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy basil lunch special and it was very tasty.  I asked for hot and it was barely spicy at all.  But other than that, it was very good.   The service was reasonably fast.   The price was ok.   There could have been a bit bigger servings, I was still a bit hungry after lunch.  But I'd go back again and sample a few more dishes."}
{"text":"I've had Thai food all over the valley and this is by far the best! The pumpkin curry is amazing and so is the pad Thai. The service is also impeccable. I love that they remember me when I come in and they are all so personable and helpful. Such a great place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was all excellent, the service was great, staff was all very friendly. We felt bad because we didn't notice we'd been talking a little past closing time but the staff was super nice about it and hadn't tried to push us out. We all enjoyed our food, looking forward to leftovers."}
{"text":"Great place if you love good Thai food. I love the massaman curry they have. It is on par with some of it's more expensive counter parts. Glad to have found this place and to live so close!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Thai food. Really delicious and great prices. Pad woon sen is so good here. Very friendly owners. Peaceful and relaxing vibe. 

The only bad thing is that the servings are rather small, so realistically they match the price of most dishes. You pay less and get less. We still love it. 5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Extremely clean, very friendly people , reasonably priced.   Thing I like about it most deserve flavors are a little different than everybody else, their menu is a little unique."}
{"text":"This place deserves every one of its five stars.  I've been looking for great Thai food and although I've found some decent places, I haven't found any that \"wow\" me... until now.  When I walked in, I was immediately greeted with the homey, welcoming scent of delicious food.  The staff was extremely courteous and friendly, and the place had a nice, cozy atmosphere.  As previous reviewers have mentioned it is small - about 6 booths and a handful of tables, but can still accommodate large groups if needed.  In fact, there was a party of 10 dining while I was there.  Most of the booths were occupied in addition to the large party at the tables and several take-out orders, but despite how busy they were service was prompt and the arrival of my food was timely.  And of course, it was tasty!  I was not disappointed and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had chicken yellow curry. It's my go to dish when I go for Thai. I asked for it got and they got it the level of spicy. I would recommend you check out this place if you're in East Mesa."}
{"text":"We were in the area and tried this place out based on the prior Yelp reviews. Wow!!! Give this place a shot! The atmosphere is friendly, comfortable, and the people are efficient! The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious! The portion size was OK - if you're really hungry - get an appetizer too.

A solid 5 stars! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been to this place a few times we love it. Can't say enough about the food and flavor. Waiters extremely helpful service very fast"}
{"text":"Found Thai Plates on Yelp (5-Stars) when I was in the Superstition Springs area. My wife had the Coconut Soup and really liked it. I had the Spicy Noodles (hot) and was not disappointed! We then shared the Sweet Rice with Custard for dessert which was rich and the perfect amount of sweet after a nice spicy dinner. 

We will definitely be going back and will be bringing our friends and family!

Great Thai food at a great price!"}
{"text":"Amazing as always!!! Best customer service and the best food. I have driven 30 miles just to have lunch here because their food is always good. I have never been disappointed with Thai Plates! 

Lunch specials are a great deal at a very reasonable price! Definitely worth it to try it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here probably 2-3 times a month..which is a lot for us but we just can't stay away. They have the best orange chicken and crab puffs that I have ever had. Their thai tea is incredible. And this little family owned business is to die for. See you all soon!"}
{"text":"Superb service and authentic delicious food.

Would have never expected this quality of food at a small little restaurant next to a grocery store. I loved every bite. The inside was roomy, prices reasonable, & the customers seasoned. Such a nice environment with a very attentive family running things."}
{"text":"My husband & I eat here with our kids at least once or twice a month. Hands down THE best Thai food in the East Valley. The owners are friendly and always provide excellent customer service. Some of our favorite dishes are the drunken noodle, all the curries are fabulous, coconut soup, and I don't know what they put in the salad dressing that comes with lunch specials but omg, I literally lick my bowl clean!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin (squash) curry was pretty good- I'd say 4 stars. Tom Sum salad fairly good. Would like a little more elegant atmosphere and some relaxing music would be nice. Here's a suggestion- some Thai or Asian relaxing music instead of the hard rock and roll, like seriously. Also- here on a night when it's 102 outside and inside the restaurant was like 100 degrees- like not even joking. Um, can you turn on the AC for Christ sake. I would go back for take out, but not again to sit in. My pants were literally sticking to my legs when j got up to leave- does not make for a pleasurable dining experience. The hubby and I were sweating bullets."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! I would eat there any day! It doesnt look like much but it a hole in the wall success!"}
{"text":"A five-star rating on Yelp *and* and 'inexpensive'? I had to try, dragged my parents along, and Thai Plates is indeed a new favorite!

We had an uber-Thai feast:

* Tom Kha soup was truly excellent, meaning the overall flavor was balanced (rare even in the Tom Kha world) and the selection of veggies and prawns were perfect. Friggin' delicious.

* Pad Woon Sen is my favorite Thai dish, a stir fry of glass noodles, eggs, many veggies and protein. I have had better (this tasted just a bit too oily) but wouldn't hesitate to order again.

* Black Bean Shrimp was too watery for my palette but nevertheless full of great flavor, generated not by MSG but the ingredients themselves.

* Green papaya salad - my mom (like me) is a veggie lover and I found it preposterous that she had never enjoyed this potentially nirvana-like experience. Neither of us were disappointed. As good Thai food should be, there was a great balance of individual flavors, such as lime and fish sauce and heat and the slightest sweetness.

The scene in this restaurant is quiet and comfortable ... thank God. Way too many restaurants these days feel it necessary to blast noise at its patrons. However, three very large television are suspended from the ceiling and, thankfully, none of them were turned on during our late afternoon meal - I just might have walked out if any of them were turned on. I am leery of future visits, however, as those teevees aren't there to collect dust.

The owners were very friendly in that most-pleasant way I've come to know after five months in Thailand myself."}
{"text":"Warm intimate atmosphere with wonderful customer service. Their food was delicious. My wife and I have been searching for a good Thai restaurant and now we have found it! We got the Pad Thai and Massaman Curry."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time eating Thai food and we loved it. They were the sweetest people! The food was amazing! We loved the soup, red curry, orange chicken, oh yeah and don't forget the fried banana!!! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and outstanding service.  The portions are large so be prepared for leftovers.  The Thai bbq chicken was a little dry but the curry dish was fantastic.  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"A real 5 star.  Food was excellent, good service and reasonable. Decor and seating in need of upgrade but experience  was so terrific who cares"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in east Mesa. I have been going there at least once a week for a year now and I have never had a dish I didn't love."}
{"text":"This update is long overdue. Oh well, the second experience was disappointing. They brought soups and main dishes at the same time. I do not understand this concept at all. I had to deal with it second time in my life in a span of 2 weeks at two different restaurants serving Thai food. Is it a new thing? We pay money to get hot food, not see how your main course gets cold. They were not even closing anytime soon; it was bizarre. We also had dirty plates piled up on our table during the duration of the lunch. The waitress passed our table on multiple occasions, and she did not make any attempts to clean it. She did refill our ice tea once though. I did not feel that she deserved 18% tip, but I left it anyway because I always try to find excuses for people. Maybe I will try this place one more time, but unless a customer asks to bring 2 courses at the same time they should never do so."}
{"text":"So I'm in town visiting my parents and decided to try some Thai food for lunch. I spent a couple months in Thailand a few years back and I really know my Thai food. I meant to go to tum nak Thai restaurant due to the high star ratings but I ended up here...and I'm very glad I did. I order the Thai basil lunch special which came with a salad, rice, egg roll. I ate every single bite and would have licked the plate clean if I was at home. If you want some Damn good Thai food, try this place out"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend had an awesome experience on this restaurant! food was great. we ordered the spicy green beans and pad see ew, the smell was pretty good and tasty. we just accidentally saw the restaurant   and we decided to try it. we used to go to other thai restaurant before but after trying this we would definitely go back.:)"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here at my in-laws recommendation. I'm so glad we did. Wow! Easily, the best Thai food I've ever eaten. My wife had the Green Curry made with chicken. I had the Pad Thai, also with chicken. In a word...delicate...the food was delicate. It was the perfect blend of prep, quantity, heat, and price. These are the kind of restaurants you wish were near you. (We currently live in SE WY) I will spread the word about this restaurant to my friends. They need to know."}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews--they didn't disappoint. The service was great. They are so friendly and the music was in Thai! I really liked it. 

The food was perfect and they serve Jasmine rice, my fav! We got the orange chicken, the red curry chicken and the sweet sticky rice for dessert. So yummy! 

We will be coming back! They definitely earned the 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"I lived in Bangkok for a couple of years and this is the real deal. Excellent food, super fresh veggies, attentive service. Inconsistent spice levels and I'd love more fresh herbs -I ask for it hot and it's not - dining companion asks for mild and it's Issan hot. 

I wish they would lose the lame Thai soft rock though - I don't like Air Supply-esque music in any language."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and so I haven't actually dined in the restaurant, but the food was very good and the veggies in my dish were a nice variety and cooked perfectly. I will for sure come back!"}
{"text":"Super great! Service is fast even though they were really busy. Spring rolls and won ton appetizers were delicious! I ordered the Thai bbq pork, was so tender and very juicy! Come try this place out :)"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Great value and fantastic service.  I definitely recommend.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place due to the Yelp reviews, and they definitely didn't disappoint!! The food was delicious and the service was excellent. It was also so nice to see servers keeping themselves busy with cleaning, the whole time they weren't helping a guest, rare to see anymore! I had Pad Thai and Fried Bananas for dessert! mmm great! Next time after a recommendation from the server I am going to try the Green Curry!"}
{"text":"I am a thai food aficionado, and tried this retaurant during a recent visit to Mesa. Loved the quality of food! Ordered Red Curry with chicken, thai iced tea and spring rolls. Curry was excellent with a good amount of veggies along with chicken. Owner is very respectful of customers. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and definitely good. Large portions and quick service. Ordered yellow curry with tofu and fresh spring rolls. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is excellent, best in the valley. Actually this is our favorite restaurant in the valley and we eat out 3 to 4 times a week."}
{"text":"A MUST GO! Amazing Food! Amazing Service! Had Red Curry with Tofu. A lot of places don't prepare tofu correctly. The tofu served with my dish was perfect! The curry was so flavorful. The servings were generous. Finished up the Mango Sticky Rice. It was delicious. I savored every bite."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant. We went on a Sat night at 6:30pm, the restaurant was just about full. We were glad we got it then because the place was packed a few minutes later and they had to turn people away! 
The service was excellent. Because the resultant was packed and the servers were starting to get busy, the owner came rushing to us to take he order, that was great. We picked the dumplings, the egg rolls, pad Thai and pad kee eiw, all of which were deliciouS. Food came out quick despite the place being full. Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. I have lately become hesitant to order shrimp dishes because of my fear it won't be fresh, but theirs was perfect. Prices are very reasonable. Most of their noodle entrees for example do not exceed $8! The server who was assigned to us was attentive and checked on us a couple of times to make sure we were doing ok. The restaurant although small is very clean and well taken care of. This is our first time to dine in but we've ordered take out before. Now after two tries, it's our favorite Thai place in Mesa! Going there again soon!"}
{"text":"Great thai food.  We went with spring rolls to start with.   They were nice and refreshing.  For dinner we had pad see eiw with chicken.  It was very good and we got it mild with the chili paste on the side to slice it up as needed.  Noodle was good and the right texture.  

We also got the #26 pad prik king with beef.  It was pretty good also but my wife's dish was better.  

I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We recently checked this place out and got take-out. The food was prepared and ready to go super quick.  We got the Spicy Basil with combo proteins, Chow Mein, Thai iced teas and Mango Sticky Rice for desert.  All were really good but needed some more heat. Come to think of it... they didn't ask, so be prepared to tell them how hot (spicy) you want your meals. Since we didn't eat there, I can't comment on the service, but the restaurant was simple and clean and I wouldn't be afraid to eat there."}
{"text":"Had their $6.95 lunch special Pad Thai with Shrimp and Chicken with medium spice. Came with a spring roll and side salad, all of which was delicious. Noodles were well cooked and seasoned with the right peanut and sweet sauce flavors. Service also very friendly, quick, and efficient. Cheap and generous portions. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us. It's clean, neat, and has great shrimp pati and orange beef.  Servers are very quick and friendly and the prices are modest.  It's small so if you go during dinner time on weekends, plan to wait but worth it."}
{"text":"Love it !      After a day of golfing we were hungry and looking for some flavorful and somewhat healthy.    This Plates fit the bill with a couple of excellent meat and veggie stirfrys.     The veggies were fresh with lots of variety and the flavors were fantastic.   We also had the cold rolls with shrimp, also delightful.    We highly recommend this restaurant, and we'll be returning soon.    P.S.  Price was reasonable, service was fast and friendly.."}
{"text":"This is a small family owned and operated business,  The restaurant is small with maybe six booths and maybe 6 small tables. The tables are a little high for the booth benches and they provide optional pillows for you to sit on. 

The better of the two meals we tried was the Pumpkin Curry with Chicken. They cooked the pumpkin and carrots absolutely perfect I don't see that too often. The sauce was mild and VERY thin. I don't think pumpkin was a part of the sauce. The chicken was on the dry side but not bad and still OK. I asked for brown rice with my meal but didn't receive any. Not a big deal and I used some white rice because we received a GIANT serving of white rice. 

Cucumber Salad was pristine fresh and crispy but was also very sweet.

I did try a small amount of the Pad Gra Pow with Beef. The beef was a little chewy but not bad and tasted sort of like soy sauce. I didn't taste much basil in this dish and this dish is about the basil and should taste like basil.  We also expected it to be spicy and asked very spicy but we received, \"OLD WHITE PERSON FROM SUN CITY SPICY\". 

For me not the best but also not the worst either and A-OK.

Portions are large and prices are very low.

Service is friendly.

Worthy of a try when you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great little place for a quick, tasty, casual meal. The food was delicious, came out quickly, very attentive severs and great prices. Very happy!"}
{"text":"This place has come a long way from its start. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is calm and enjoyable. The food is very authentic and this place is definitely a hole in the wall, a hidden gem. Try this place out if you want to try authentic thai food."}
{"text":"We ordered Larb salad, yellow curry, tom yum hot pot, pad Thai and grilled shrimp salad. It was all pretty good. I enjoyed the tom yum soup and grilled shrimp salad the most. I love how fresh everything tasted."}
{"text":"Always good food, pleasant owners, great prices and speedy service make this my favorite go to restaurant for a healthy bite. I've tried most everything on the menu and have not been disappointed once!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch.  Good food.  OK service.  Tried Green Cury and at 'mild' it was still spicy!  Wide had spicy beef 'med-hot' and liked it.  If your in this part of town it's worth trying."}
{"text":"So good especially for the price. Got the panang curry chicken medium. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was great and even with it being extremely busy we had amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Just ate here with my wife. Absolutely amazing I had the pad thai she had the pineapple curry and we both had the crab puffs (heaven on earth) and fried shrimp(delicious) GO HERE"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious!! My boyfriend and I went one night and he had the orange chicken and I had the yellow curry. I asked to substitute the squash with green beans and was told they usually don't do that but he would check with the cooks! He came back and said that they could do that for me. The food was absolutely delicious and we actually went back the next night. One of our new favorite places!!"}
{"text":"Despite the minor confusion of self seating..
Friendly staff, fast service & inexpensive food delectably proportioned!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a great Thai restaurant since I moved to Mesa, AZ and finally found it! This is a quaint, smaller restaurant with a nice ambience. The booths have this very comfortable rounded design that feels great on your back. The food is amazing! I had a chicken dish with fat rice noodles in a brown gravy sauce and mixed vegetables. I really loved it! My husband had the cashew chicken with a level 4 spiciness and said it was great! This restaurant has great reviews on every site I've seen it on. The manager was very friendly and chatted with us for a bit. He says business is slow during the summer since many people in this area leave ( snowbirds) and come back in October. He said then they are always quite busy. They've been open for 2 years. So happy we found this place! Don't miss it! Try it and spread the word."}
{"text":"Attentive and friendly service. The food was delicious and well priced. We had the panang curry and coconut soup-both were exactly what we were hoping for. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Still the best Thai in Mesa, especially the east-side.  We've been dinning here for almost 3 years and we've never been disappointed. The owner along with his sister are the servers and they always aim to please. Food is wonderfully authentic!"}
{"text":"Came by 8.30pm. They won't even seat us. There was only 2 other patrons. They closed at 9pm. We went to Thai House just down the road. They were packed but found 2 seats for us without hesitation. Food at Thai house is always good, fresh and fast."}
{"text":"This place has the best curry noodle I've ever had, everything was amazing. We had the crab wontons and fresh spring rolls to start and split the entree, it was a perfect amount of food for two and tasted great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nothing special...Well, the reviews sounded good, so my husband and I decided to go.  Honestly the food was ok and the service was just blah.  I had the eggplant was cooked well but was bland.  My husband had the green curry which was on par with so many other Thai restaurants.  The space was clean but the bathroom was dusty.   Perhaps I'm picky but I'm craving something to stand out as special.  This place is not it."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been searching for a good Thai restaurant in the Mesa area for YEARS and this is not just good, ITS GREAT!! I've driven past the intersection of Broadway & Power many times per week for years and had never seen this restaurant tucked I next to Albertsons on the NE corner but after checking out Yelp to find another
Thai restaurant and reading the reviews we decided to give it a try and BOY are we glad we did. The Phad Thai was excellent and so was the Red Curry and the Pineapple Fried Rice. The portions were generous so we have leftovers. YAY!! The restaurant is clean, the service was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable. We will be regulars now that we have found this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Plate-licking worthy. 
Another gem. Truly authentic and wonderfully priced. Lovely family-run restaurant that truly deserves 5 full stars. 
I see why they take reservations because there are maybe 10 tables, and they get filled up quickly.
You can choose your level of hot too. Mild, medium, hot, extra hot, and Thai hot. My husband ordered the Thai hot and it was phenomenal if you like heat! I ordered the extra hot and wished I would have ordered Thai hot, but be aware, I eat hot sauce on everything. 
I will definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple times now, and while I am new to trying Thai food, this is really good, and the staff is very pleasant.  I do not care for hot, spicy food but that's not a concern as you can order it without spice or have spice on the side so you can add it as you like it.  I've had the Pad Thai which is very good.  My friend has yellow curry, and I tasted that but do not care for the flavor.  Other friends had the chow mien which they liked and it looked delicious.  Try to go during the week and have the luncheon specials to get a really good meal at a very good price."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place in the Phoenix Valley! We haven't found anything better and now we don't even try other places. We drive 25 minutes to get here just because it is that good!! The Pad Thai and Massaman Curry is my favorite!! Although the Pangang Curry is pretty great!
The staff is always so nice and they always get the food out really fast no matter how busy it is. I have never had a bad experience there"}
{"text":"We discovered Thai Plates about a year ago.  I regularly bring a group of friends here and they all love it- event he ones who \"don't eat Thai!\"  The freshness and flavors are irresistible.  My favorite is the Pumpkin Curry, but everything I've had here is great. It's a family owned business and they remember us and it's great to support such terrific people. I love their soups.  I order their food medium and it just burns a bit.  The only drawback? It's getting more popular as people catch on so sometimes there's a wait.  But it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Well here I am again at my favorite Thai restaurant.. This time I place a to go order my favorite #33 with chicken also tried the pineapple fried rice absolutely delicious and the hot and sour soup because I have sinus issues and need to clear that up it was absolute torture having to wait to drive home to eat it hands down best Thai restaurant in Arizona"}
{"text":"Have eaten here 3 times so far. The food has always been fresh and tasty. 

They're not shy about heat levels so if you ask for Thai Hot that's what you'll get. Such a nice change from so many places that dull it down!

Still working through the menu, but not a single disappointment yet. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars because food came out hot and delicious. But our three meals came out sequentially over 5-8 minutes. Tip: Look for the entrance behind Wells Fargo."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Thai place I have ever been to! Everyone that works there is so sweet and their food is to die for. Their prices are so cheap too! Definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"OMG! That was good!
We had the Yellow curry noddles and the Pad Thai rice, they didn't disappoint! Good price and good service!
I will even come back next time we come to this side of town."}
{"text":"Great food and they work real hard. They could use another server here so we don't have to feel so sorry for the young man running around trying to keep everyone happy. i will return, which would be my 3rd time"}
{"text":"Yelpers were right, Thai Plate is wonderful! 

I ordered Pad Thai (level 2 spice) and it was a delicious mix of spice and slightly sweet Thai sauce with a hint of peanut. My fiancé ordered yellow curry with shrimp and he loved every bite! 

Service was excellent, prices and portion sizes were reasonable, and the dish arrived hot and fast!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place our family found.  Attentive and quick service.  We had the Pad Thai and Thai fried rice.  Crispy won-tons were delicious .  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best pad thais I've had in awhile. The lunch portion was the perfect amount and came with a spring roll. We got traditional fried rice as well, so yummy! 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Okay, this place is INSANE! My coworker raved about Thai Plates & insisted that the entire office go here for lunch. I was expecting a subpar experience from this small family business, and I was so wrong. Everything from the Thai Tea, to the small lunch Salad, to the Main course was fantastic! All of the produce was fresh, and crispy. I had the Pumpkin Curry, it was incredible! I've never had Curry before, so I'm not sure if it was \"good\" by terms of Curry Connoisseurs but, as a dish, it was out of this world. 

We had a party of five, and our food took about 7-10 minutes to arrive at our table. Everyone at our table was raving about their dishes. Which, included: Pad Thai, Orange Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, and the Green Curry.

This place did not skip a beat. I would recommend Thai Plates to anyone!"}
{"text":"First time here and ordered pad thai which was good, 2nd time here and ordered kung pow chicken!! Which was a scam!! Lots of big carrots and zucchini believe it or not!! I had to search for the shaved chicken which was not much!! My wife ordered the sweet and sour chicken which was same thing, SMALL PORTIONS!, , dont waste your money or time in this switch and bait joint!!"}
{"text":"A really great place tucked in to the right of Albertson's. Excellent management. Wonderful coconut soup, but be sure to pick out the lemongrass, Bayleaf, and ginger root as they are quite tough to chew. These spring rolls and Pad thai were excellent and they even had green jasmine tea! My only suggestion would be since pad Thai sauce is very very sweet, I ask for that on the side next time."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Thai restaurant. The people are always nice and they remember us each time. The place is very clean and the food is incredible. If you like Thai Hot this is the place. I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy noodles with beef. Dish is really yummy. I ordered it a 3 which is what I normally do. 3 wasn't at all spicy. But every Thai place is different. He beef was super chewy but decent flavor. Boyfriend got the same dish with chicken and the chicken was great. 

I would say the fried shrimp are a must. So good! The crab puffs are also amazing. Love that there is onion! Really good overall! Just sad about the beef and the spice but now I know! Also good on price."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent tasting Thai spot in Mesa that is close enough to me!!! I'm from Southern California and took a recent trip to Thailand this summer, so I'm pretty particular about my Thai food! 

Also, this spot is located on the side of Albertsons on Power and Broadway. The troll who dropped the location pin for Thai Plates didn't know how to drop a freakin' pin, caused me to circle around for a while to find the spot when I was sooooooo hungry. No bueno.

Parking: plentiful during lunch time, I don't think this will ever be a problem in AZ LOL

Ambience: non existent, it's a quaint spot, no thrill, no show, just good old food as their only attraction. My friends and I wanted to eat at home so we ordered to-go, I can't quite comment on their service.

FOOD: the only thing that matters here. 
-Chicken satay with peanut sauce (appetizer) 2.5/5: it was a bit dry and not really memorable, the peanut sauce is gooood though!

-Pad see ew with beef: 1/5, the worst item we had that day, the noodles were overcooked, soggy, broken into pieces, just meh.

-Som tum aka papaya salad: 4.5/5 the crunchy texture was perfect, the shrimps were massive, the dressing was on point. Dare I say, it was almost as good as the ones I've had in Thailand!!!!

-Pumpkin curry: 4.5/5 we were feeling a bit #basic, so we wanted some pumpkin things for Fall, it's basically the same as red curry, but with pumpkin instead of potatoes. It was SO GOOD! Definitely recommend

- Eggplants with tofu 4/5: this was also yummy, the eggplants was cooked just right, the sauce was delicious, the tofu was just a little dry, but I would order this again!

I'll will definitely be back for more! Probably next week when I don't have time to cook while studying for exams :P"}
{"text":"Excellent Basil and Pork, Pad Ga-prao Moo, perfectly spiced... I had Hot but they even have Thai Hot.  Excellent, I'll be back for sure.  AND I've spent a LOT of time in Thailand."}
{"text":"My family came here one night and it was really empty. You can tell they've redone the place but it has a very weird vibe (giant TVs with nothing playing, different  chairs at each table, etc) 

We ordered the spicy noodles, pumpkin curry, pad Thai, Thai tea, and the sticky rice dessert. Food came out in a timely manner and service was great.  

The food was pretty good. The noodles were flavorful and the meat was tender. My mom got the pumpkin curry and we all agreed that it was delicious, it was easily our favorite dish. The pad Thai is the reason for four stars. It was extremely sweet to the point that no one ate any of it. The Thai tea was flavorful and delicious as well as the sticky rice. 

The price, ambience, and pad Thai is why Thai plates did not get five stars"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go out to dinner on NYE 2015 and this is where we ended up.  It's a small mom and pop type restaurant -fairly unassuming inside of a strip mall in Mesa.

The food is good, there are a few things I really liked about it:

- Good quantities.  It was refreshing to go someplace where the portion was not overly large, but not too small either.  
- The price matched the quantity - there's nothing worse than paying $12 for a dish that you can only eat half of.  In this case, their prices were spot on - making it easy to get in and out for about $12/person including an appetizer.
- The food was fresh and flavorful.  I had the pad thai, my wife the thai basil (some rice dish with basil and spices.)  Both were good, and freshly made to order.   We had the spring rolls as well, which weren't bad either.

Overall, this is a great place for a cheap date/lunch."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service!!! Highly recommend! The prices -- not too expensive!"}
{"text":"This place has by far surpassed any other thai restaurant I have tried in the valley--yes, even the popular Thai chili. I happened to stumble in after a long shift at the hospital (it's right across from Banner Baywood) with quite a nasty cold. The sweet waitress suggested the tom yum soup. Fantastic!!!! Hot, fresh, with the tang of kaffir lime, large prawns, and a huge kick. My husband, who joined me for dinner, loved this as well. We also ordered the thai spicy noodles with beef. Those luscious flat noodles were just layered with tender beef, sweet peppers, and garlicky spicy goodness. We ate everything and despite being full with runny noses, we ordered dessert! My husband tried the fried bananas, which were tasty but what topped that was my dessert. I'm a huge fan of sticky rice with mango and to my disappointment mango was out of season. The sweet waitress asked the chef who came up with something just as wonderful: sweet sticky rice with coconut icecream topped with plum seeds and peanuts. OMG!! The dessert was heavenly but I was more impressed with whatever genius they have working in the kitchen. Everything was so fresh, beautiful, and delicious! I'm concerned that nobody seems to know about this place. I would stand out in the street and direct traffic just to keep them open!"}
{"text":"Wanted something different for lunch one day while working in the area.  Good reviews and good prices.  Tried it out. Ordered a kung pao chicken lunch special.  Thai spice.  

It was excellent.  Ive been back twice since.  Havent been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Wifey, our son and myself tried their BBQ Chicken, Spice Basil Chicken, Pad Kee Mao and Massaman curry.  Also got an appetizer called Golden Tofu which was fried and served with an awesome dipping sauce.

Overall, I was very impressed with the food.  The flavors were spot on for me.  I would definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu.

All toll, 4 dinner dishes with 1 appetizer came to $40 before tip.

\"Piece\"!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the spring rolls, pad thai, and seafood basil.  We have been here 3 times and great food and service each time. Definitely 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy as far as decor, but nice enough. Right next to albertsons so you can even grocery stop afterward.

We came here based on the excellent reviews so we had high hopes. We ordered the fried spring rolls, chicken pad Thai, red curry, and broccoli lover dishes. 

The spring rolls were ok. I think next time I will be ordering the fresh ones though. So if you're deciding between the two, pick the fresh ones. 

The broccoli lover was amazing. The pad Thai was sweet, and although I'm not a fan of sweet pad Thai, the consistency of the veggies and noodles and the fact it was saucier than most, I was a fan. I added a spoonful of my curry over the pad Thai to cut the sweetness a bit. 

Overall, good food. Nothing super special, but consistent and tasty. And sometimes, that's what Us customers really want."}
{"text":"Wow what a great meal. Tom yum hotpot and pad prik king. Just great food and deserves every star."}
{"text":"Thai plates was fantastic! After spending time in Thailand, I've had a hard time finding authentic Thai food...that was until I found Thai Plates. The food was amazing and the service was impeccable! My party shared the crab puffs, Tom yum soup, Pad Thai with calamari & massaman curry with shrimp, they were all great. The spice was right on and depth of flavor was superb. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"Very nice people. Fast service. Quick seating. Get the pineapple curry! It's so good and they are generous with the amount of food they give. The water there is good too"}
{"text":"Had the Thai Fried Rice with chicken, medium-hot. It was delicious. Also ordered a cucumber salad, and it was crisp, tasty, and refreshing.  The service was incredibly friendly and fast.  I will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Love thai food and was so happy to not only disciver this restaurant but to be easy to get to and have the food be so good.  Service was fabulous, will be eating here quite often."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and since we were traveling through Mesa we decided to stop in. First of all the service was excellent and they were friendly. The menu had a great selection. We ordered the orange chicken, house special and the Pad Thai.  They were all very tasty and were good portions. I will be back next time we are on the side of town."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Thai places. My favorite places back home don't come close to the quality of their food!  Bummer that I'll probably only get here once. Loved the food and the atmosphere. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. The portions are plenty and the service is prompt! Try them out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a little place with yummy stuff!  It must be the location they are in, for they are not as busy as they should.  I have eaten here three times and the third time I brought my hubby.  My hubby explained to the manager that he is celiac and need to avoid wheat products.  The manager checked his ingredients and made recommendations on what my hubby could safely order.  I ordered spicy basil stir-fry with pork and hubby ordered garlic and pepper with chicken.  The food came quickly and hot (just the way I like it.) What I appreciated the most was the manager had the kitchen put my hubby's egg-roll (with wheat flour skin) on my plate because he remembered my hubby's diet restriction.  The food was very good and inexpensive ($6.95 lunch special.) Hubby liked it a lot.  Looks like a place we will come back many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Service was very fast, but the food was easily the best Thai food I've ever eaten. Fantastic experience"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!!!
The food was out of this world and I loved the little \"kush for your tush\". Nice touch! The real \"headliner\" was the food! OMG!!!!!!! I felt guilty at the prices and I can honestly say, \"It was the BEST Thai food I have ever eaten!\" and I wish them many years of success!!!!!!  I will definitely be back, many more times!!!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find a great Thai restaurant in Mesa. We had the chicken yellow curry and beef ginger. Both excellent. Sticky rice with mango for dessert. Terrific service. This is not a large restaurant so come early or be prepared to wait. ( It is worth it). Great value. Great food. This is not your cliche Thai but rather good food."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.  The restaurant is older with seats that lack any kind cushion in booths.  Atmosphere was quiet and restaurant was clean.  We were greeted immediately with great customer service from waitress. 
I ordered chow menu with steak and my husband ordered the yellow curry with shrimp.  
Our food came out quick and it was hot.   The ingredients are fresh and it was delicious.  They have great customer service and check to make sure you enjoyed your meal.  
We loved it!  We will definitely be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Today I had a very pleasant lunch here.  I was expecting a \"walk up and order\" place and was surprised to find this pretty little place. It is small and fancy with tablecloths and we were blessed to get the last available table.  The food was excellant.  I had the Massaman Curry with beef and Mom had the lunch special of Chow Mien with pork. It came with a fresh salad and a spring roll as well.   It was hot and delicious.  Yea.  I found a new gem of a restaurant.  I can't wait to become a regular."}
{"text":"Their crab wontons are amazing! Their costumer service was fabulous. I had their pad see ew and it was also delish, the broccoli even had flavor. Definitely a new favorite place."}
{"text":"The owners are so cute! Their PAD THAI WAS AMAZING. The vegetables were perfectly cooked (not soggy, just the right amount of bite). Lots of bang for your buck. Definitely recommend. They will teach you Thai."}
{"text":"Enjoyed!

Arrived just before 7 PM.

Tommy was our server.

Started with the potstickers, nice presentation & served with a sweet sauce versus the Ponzu Style you tend to be use too!

My daughter had the orange chicken. It's similar to a family style serving and plenty for two to share. It came with a fluffy white jasmine rice.

I had the #54 Yellow Curry Noodle with chicken. The chicken was thinly sliced and tender within the dish. The squash was the perfect consistency somewhat al dente & a better option ( in my opinion) than potato. Creamy coconut milk, Rich flavorful curry that I requested medium. \"Do it\" They will bring extra chili sauce to the table, so it was a perfect offering as you can add more heat if you wish!

In speaking with our server Tommy, the family has 5 locations including - New Mexico & California ( In Hollywood). Each location is family owned &  operated. Everything is made in house. Orange chicken is made from scratch. All the authentic dishes are also made fresh daily! 

My Curry was absolutely delicious! I left there completely satisfied with the portion sizes & price.

We will definitely be repeat customers & I highly recommend that you try this place out."}
{"text":"Real good Service, looks like a family run business. We ordered cashew chicken and pineapple fried rice Thai hot and as expected it hit the spot. 

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I got the pad Thai & basil fried rice, both with beef!The basil fried rice was very good and I would definitely order again! The pad Thai was good, but not my thing...I haven't had it before, but it looked good in the pictures, so I got it! Just wasn't something I personally would order again cause I'm not crazy about the sweetness of it! Overall it's a great dinner with lots of left overs!"}
{"text":"Yelp led me to this place when I was in the mall and not feeling a food court or Cheesecake Factory. It was a great recommendation! I had just the Panang Curry to go, and it came with a small 'pint' of white rice. The actual curry container was enough for two big meals, each with half the curry and a full pint of rice (I made my own rice for the leftovers). It was a very good curry and \"medium\" was just right for me. 

I will say it falls short of a 5-star review only because it isn't worth the 25 minute drive from my house just by itself. But I feel like I will get it if I'm in the area, I will stop in for more takeout!"}
{"text":"The best whole in wall cuisine you can find.  The service you can't beat, staff is super friendly and aim to please. The food is phenomenal. If you go, get the Thai tea it's icing to the cake. The whole menu is under-priced. All around Amazing."}
{"text":"I had a great experience today. I recently moved to the area. Was craving wanton soup to help me kick a stomach bug. I called in my order and my bf picked up. The person who took my order was very nice and helpful. My bf said the restaurant was nice and clean. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment- I love Thai food - I did not care for this place- so there lunch menu is lacking and the savings over dinner plates is negotiable- my son got the lunch orange chicken- for 7.50 - it came with a egg roll and a little salad - the salad dressing was nice and the lunch portion was good - the fried rice was very basic and a bit of a let down - I ordered the yellow curry - not good at all - the portion was fine the price was expected- but the flavor was soooo off - it had a grainy texture and a tart taste - what I love about yellow curry is the lovely sweet coconut milk that it is made with - totally lacking from this dish - the grainy texture was also very off putting, like bits of dirt or sand - and when I asked about it I was told it was how it should be made - now I will never claim to be a Thai food expert - but I have eaten yellow curry in 7 countries and about 22 states - this by far was the most disappointing-"}
{"text":"Unwelcoming. Walked in at 8:10 and was not greeted at all. Acted put off we were there and mentioned kitchen closes at 8:30 despite closing at 9. Walked out."}
{"text":"We eat here once a week, by far the best Thai restaurant we have eaten at in the valley in 15 years we have lived here. The portions are large and everything is always so fresh and delicious. I love the Green Chicken Curry and Thai Basil Chicken but everything we eat there is so good. The Owners and staff are all super friendly."}
{"text":"I would have given it 3 stars but the 4 and a half stars it already has is way to high, I am trying to bring this place down to earth. It's not bad, but they use the lowest quality rice possible. There was very little meat in the meals they gave us and they weren't very good serving sizes. They tasted good, but I don't have any urge to say this is the best food I have ever had. Please if you are going to leave a revue for this place, make sure you know what great food is before hand."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I have to say I am HOOKED! Everything was so so good! They were great and told us what they recommended."}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant. We ordered Potstickers, a cup of Wonton Soup, Orange Chicken and Chicken Pad Prik King. The best dish was the soup. Lots of veggies and flavorful broth. The sauce on the Orange Chicken was good, but it was mostly breading and very little chicken.

I would have given a better rating but the service was so SLOW. There are 10 tables in the restaurant and it was only half full after we arrived.  But we sat for nearly 10 mins before our order was taken and it took another 20 before our soup and potstickers arrived. There was some takeout activity, but not much. The wait was not proportionate to the amount of business. 

If you have time and are in the area, try it.  Don't go out of your way to get here."}
{"text":"Very good Panang curry made here. Colorful veggies and thin curry sauce make this look and taste wonderful.  Other restaurants sometimes make the curry sauce too thick, so it hides the bell peppers. I ordered 2 Star spicy, but it was a bit hotter than expected.

The dining area isn't fancy, but it is very clean and functional, with about 10 tables in a single room.  The owner/manager was very friendly and we chatted a bit while I waited for my order. I did not call in advance, but they had the food ready in about 5 minutes.

Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest and best tasting Thai food I've ever had. I would eat there everyday if I could be sure to try the papaya salad."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in Mesa.  Great food and super reasonable prices.  Service was outstanding too, staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Great customer service and food. We tried a number of dishes and they were all excellent."}
{"text":"I did what I always do when I'm hungry and unfamiliar with an area, I checked out yelp. 

Thai Plates had a 5 star rating with a whole pile of rave reviews, so how could I resist trying this place?  As it turns out, all of the reviews are well deserved.  I had the Pad Prik King, which is the dish I order at every Thai place to compare.  It was awesome. So was my wife's broccoli with peanut sauce. And everyone is right about the amazing service. 

I love this place and only wish it were closer to home. I would definitely eat here again. And again."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place has 5 stars. I judge a Thai restaurant, first by their panang curry. All I gotta say is, this rivals tasty thai and yupha's thai in tempe. Might actually beat them in flavor. That's hard for me to say because I'm such a huge fan of both restaurants. Everything on my plate was cooked perfect! Definitely going back to try more dishes. Woop! Another awesome Thai place to dine! :-D"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! I tried the pad Thai as I always do when I first try a Thai place. It was  very tasty, it is sweeter than any of pad Thai I have ever had before and at first it was very good but about half way through it became a little too sweet. I took the other half home and had it for lunch the next day which ended up being perfect because it's too sweet to eat the entire thing in one sitting. I got it medium (mild, medium, hot, extra hot, Thai hot) which I thought might not have enough spice since I normally order a 3 out of 5 at other Thai restaurants... Nope! It was right on the border of being too hot. So be conservative when ordering on the spice. 
The best part of this restaurant and the reason I gave it a 5 instead of a 4, which I think would reflect the food better, is because of the service. I have only been to one other Thai place where the staff asks you about you meal and is truly curious and has other recommendations and really wants to make sure you enjoyed your meal so you will come back. Because of the service I will be back to try more!!

Went back and tried the pumpkin curry and the basil fried rice. OMG I love pumpkin curry! A must try at this restaurant. The basil fried rice is definitely in the top 5 I have tried and I have tried a lot since that is what my boyfriend always orders."}
{"text":"If you are in the Phoenix area I definitely recommend this place. My dad and I came on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately and the service was super fast!  Right when we chose our seat they came to our table asking for our drinks. But what caught me more off guard was the fact that the food came out maybe less than 10 minutes after we ordered. My dad ordered a house special dish and I ordered the Pad see Eiw. I thought that we ordered our own dish, but when a server came up she put our dishes in the middle and gave us smaller plates to serve ourselves on, but I guess that's just how they run their restaurant! 

Another thing that surprised me was the price of their items. Dishes are generally under $10 and I felt like I found the best hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant in the area considering I was from out of town. I definitely got the bang for my buck"}
{"text":"Thai Plates is such a solid find.  Finally some decent Asian food in Mesa.  I've been staying at a family member's house out here in Mesa while we have been closing on our house in Phoenix and I wish I had tried Thai Plates sooner. It's definitely the best Asian cuisine on this side of town.  

I'll start with what I enjoyed most, the Tom Kha soup.  So delicious, just the right flavors I was looking for.  They only offered it with chicken on their menu, but could make it vegetarian, which is how we ordered it.  We went with the large size and it was the perfect amount for both us.

The beef Pad Thai was good.  I ordered it hot and I could have handled it even hotter.  I always get nervous ordering Thai Hot because I still like to taste the food, but I could have easily cranked it up. It was still really enjoyable, but their hot isn't nearly as hot as other Thai places I frequent.  

The tofu Pad Kee Mao was also really good. We ordered this dish \"hot\" also but we could of handled more spicy.  The noodles were the perfect consistency.

Stoked on a decent Thai spot in Mesa, we will be back."}
{"text":"Staff are super friendly, food is exceptional. I would recommend this little gem to everyone who loves Thai food. By the way everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"Service was good and food was delicious. Plated professionally and the sauces were superb. Enjoyed the meal immensely!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. We came here last night, because we are vacationing through Arizona and New Mexico and Phoenix is our last stop before going back to California. This place was so delicious, that we decided instead of eating our crappy motel breakfast in the morning, we would just eat this instead. Yeah it's that good!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! I subtracted one star because it took a while for the waitress to get our drink order and the booth seats are not very comfortable, but otherwise, the prices are reasonable and food delicious and flavorful."}
{"text":"Really good Thai! Far better than we expected. Great service and cozy atmosphere. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Happy we found this place! Delicious! Best orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken I ever had. We all loved it. Can't wait to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Pad see ew is very tasty but their prices are more than they should be. It's a nice hole in the wall restaurant were you can go to get some fresh Thai food but it is not fancy that's for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Very quaint and personable. The service is awesome as well. I always get the Orange chicken which is amazing. By far the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and authentic Thai flavors which, being Australian, I really appreciate as I am spoiled by growing up in a country filled with many great Thai (and all Asian) restaurants... THis makes me kinda picky when it comes to eating Asian /Thai food in America as so many restaurants try to westernize the dishes to suit the local palates. The dishes here were great - clean, tasty, fresh. Ordered the fresh spring rolls (rice paper) with shrimp - excellent: then the chicken potstickers - delicious. Thai beef salad - tasty and good but not my favorite dish. And the spicy basil with salmon - excellent. Plus rice: all up bill was under $36 + tip. Outstanding value, lovely decor, warm and friendly service and excellent food. Family owned business - they have another restaurant in Hollywood and been in Thai restaurant biz in USA for over 30 years. Highly recommend: we will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken plate from here is was decent alittle bland but not bad I think next time I'll
Try something different"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I's absolute favorite go to! We go here so much, they know our order by heart and get thrown off when we want to try something new. Theyre always so welcoming.
Our orders are made fast every time and always as delicious as the last. Their pad Thai is the best I've tried out here so far and compare all others to theirs. They never ever skimp, especially on meat orders like other restaurants do. And make sure you order their sticky rice & custard for dessert!"}
{"text":"Best place to get Thai food! This is mine and my boyfriends go-to place for thai. I know he eats here a couple times a week because he works so close, and he brings me lunch from here about weekly. I almost always get their green curry because it is so good! But sometimes I branch out and get spicy basil, chicken fried rice, or their shrimp soup (forgot the name). Everything is always very fresh made to order. I love spicy so I always get the 4.5 and its just hot enough that my mouth is on fire but I can still handle it.There is always a good crowd when we go in to eat, but never have to wait for a seat. We love Thai plates and will continue coming here when we want to satisfy that craving."}
{"text":"The reviews were spot on accurate for this place.  The owners and staff are very friendly and the flavors of the levels of spice were good, although we didn't try higher than the 3.  The booths were a little old, but honestly the atmosphere and attitude of the staff made up for it and the food was excellent.  Definitely will be coming back here when we are in the area."}
