{"text":"It is not big deal about this coffee shop, not comfortable seating, food just OK, very terrible service"}
{"text":"Drop by for lunch time, clean place and the food is ok but the portion is enough for blunch.
The only problem will be the the parking, really no place to park."}
{"text":"first time visiting. Friendly service. ordered eggs Benedict with bacon, spinach, avocado. hollandaise sauce was nice and light. would have been better if English muffin was toasted and if more avocado was on it (only thin slices). matcha latte was just ok-was watery and didn't have full matcha flavour. seating is limited."}
{"text":"Brewed coffee was smooth medium roast wayyyy better than Timmies or Starbucks. Got a shot of Ghirardelli chocolate syrup to make it a mocha coffee."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever in Toronto. Waited for more than 15 mins with no one coming help us. Went to ask for seats, the waiter was so rude saying\" I already told ur friend (which he didn't) why u still asking? It's selfserve. Go serve urself!\"
Literally WTF. It's a small restaurant which I understand and not expecting much customer service from them. But this is way too much. So I highly recommend to only go to this restaurant when it's not brunch time so they can take time serving you"}
{"text":"The place is pretty small. Rmb to come early or avoid the peak time. It's self seat situation and really doesn't have any spaces to accommodate big groups. I ordered the mocha latte but was given a chai latte towards the very end of my meal. I need to leave really soon so didn't even bring it up. Waiters were so busy they don't even have time to refill water in the self serve area.  

We found ourselves a seat first then ordered and paid before we can sit down and waited for our food. The waiting time was a bit too long for a breakfast. Or maybe just the day I go? I don't know. I waited almost an hour. I would go somewhere else if in the rush for a quick bite. 

The meal tasted average for me, the eggs were pretty nice and runny tho."}
{"text":"This place is a little overrated. My friend had the chicken & waffle with the chicken too dry and over done. I had the blueberry pancake: fluffy and cute. The food is alright, what I would expect with such a  price. However, the place is way too crowded on Saturday morning at 9:30AM. 

If you are looking for somewhere to chitchat and catch up with friend. This is not the place."}
{"text":"Finally came to this place with my friend this afternoon, mostly sunny with the high as 30 degree Celsius. We had ordered the must-try item of matcha latte cookie and it was so delicious that you won't feel disappointed :)  Also, we ordered one cappuccino (with lactose free milk as per my request) and one Espresso macchiato and they all came out so perfect. We really enjoyed our coffee and cookie with a delightful ambiance and beautiful background music. We are so happy now to find such a nice place whenever we want to hang out with friends with nice coffee..."}
{"text":"Finally a good coffee shop in Markham. The price is a little expensive for a cappuccino, over $4, but the quality is good. They use pilot coffee. If your a pilot fan then you will be happy here. Nice atmosphere and the guy making my capp was nice."}
{"text":"Short and sweet: 5 stars for the pork belly open faced omelette. It's braised pork that tastes like pork adobo. All the rest are okay food. Overall 3 stars for the long wait being a tiny place and people overstaying after their meal, and quite pricey for the portion. Buy take out if you just want to try the food."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch place in Markham. I got the Eggs Benny with peameal bacon and the buttermilk pancake to share. The Eggs Benny was good, pretty standard. I really liked the buttermilk pancake, it was fluffy and it came with condensed milk instead of your regular maple syrup. There were also cornflakes on the the pancakes which gave it a good crunch. 

We got the Matcha latte, flat white and chai tea latte. I wasn't a fan of the chai tea latte. But the flat white and matcha latte was really good. 

If you come make sure to get here early or be ready to wait. This place isn't very big and it fills up pretty quickly on the weekends."}
{"text":"Food is expensive for what you get.  Coffee is good(not amazing)

We ordered:

-Crispy shrimp, avocado, roast carrots omelette ($14) served with house salad:  Omelette is served in a small skillet.  The omelette is quite small(looks like 3 small eggs).  The side salad was small too.  Didn't feel like the ingredients go well together.  This is very expensive for what you are getting.    Rating: 2/5

-Classic Brekkie ($8): 3 eggs(small ones), your choice of bacon or sausage, home fries, toast. This is just your standard breakfast.  Nothing special.  The house fries were above average. Rating 3/5

-Cappuccino (6oz; $3.80): Nice smooth texture. Rating: 3.5/5

-Iced latte (10oz; 4.50): good mixture of milk and coffee. Rating: 3.5/5


Just come here for the coffee not the food."}
{"text":"This is my first brunch choice?everything is delicious.If you go there on weekends?you may need to wait for table."}
{"text":"This place is tiny. But the brunch is awesome. Chicken and waffles are great. Classic breakfast for $9. I love the breakfast potatoes.

You just go straight to the cashier to order & pay first. Then seat yourself and they will serve you!

Been here for brunch twice now on Sunday morning. It's getting to be pretty popular so If you want Sunday brunch come before 10. We have shown up at 11 both times. The first time we got lucky with a couple leaving just as we arrived, but the second time we had to wait 10 minutes to sit down.

Because the place is so small there's really no place where people can wait for a table so they tend to just crowd around the door since it's cold outside. This morning they even left the door open way too long so that really sucks if your sitting at the small table beside the door. So that soured my experience a bit. My waffles got cold awfully quick."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time on a Sunday afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed my espresso macchiato, the friendly staff and decor that we decided to come back for breakfast the very next day. 

So after a morning run on Victoria Day, we dropped by for a hard earned breakfast. I ordered an open faced omelette with bacon and a dry cappuccino. Eggs were done to perfection though I personally would have liked the bacon to be a little crispier. None the less, the omelette was still very very good! The cappuccino was definitely one of the better ones I've had in a long time! Not just a cup of hot dairy you so often find.

Friend had the eggs benny and found eggs yolks a little overdone and not quite enough hollandaise, but the flavours made up for it!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time on a Friday morning, thinking that there'd be almost no one there but it was a full house. It was slightly confusing at first as to whether someone will take my order or I should go up to the cashier to place my order. So, the menu is on the wall and you place the order at the cashier. Still not sure why we got paper coffee cups while other customers had ceramic cups but that's just a minor issue. 

The coffee was great, hot and strong. I ordered the peameal bacon benny, the portion was surprisingly big with a salad and mini potatoes. The benny was perfect, salivating as I am remembering it. The potatoes were a little oily but well cooked through and through. 

I will definitely go back again but if I go with more than 2 people, then maybe I will call ahead to see how busy they're first. Last thing I want is to go sans coffee and breakfast but have to stand there, smell the coffee and watch other people eat."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Alchemy Coffee for breakfast. Quaint place with urban decor and great food. We had the pancakes and the open face bacon and goat cheese omelette and both were delicious and full of flavour. The food will surely not disappoint."}
{"text":"Amazing little place! The most delicious pancakes ever! The coffee is great too! Been here twice and will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Love small business!  Pork berry melts into your mouth and coffee was perfect.  We were managed to find a seat after ordering becuz the place is find your own seat."}
{"text":"honestly.  Great place.  The only bad thing about this place is the amount of seating available, as it gets packed quickly.  Also, its not the type of place where you sit, eat, and go.  You probably want to kick back and relax a bit, while you enjoy the amazing food you get. 

I'm not a coffee person, but my brother who is says its good, and hes picky, so theres that.

I had the tea, which was good. imo.

The waffle chicken was awesome.  For chicken lovers, its good.  No issues.

The other food they serve looks great, family and friends had no issues.

I recommend you going earlier, like 11 for brunch.  Any later, you might end up waiting a long time."}
{"text":"Kinda like a cafe style here where you serve yourself and find your own seat. Since it gets really busy here, especially on weekends, plan accordingly! I wouldn't recommend coming here with a big group, parking is also limited... Food is amazing though. Brunch here is sooo good! I would come here more often if there was more parking and the seating isn't so hectic."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday morning and they were fairly busy. The owner advised us that they just opened officially yesterday, so they were still getting a hang of things. 

While we were waiting for our food about 15 mins in, they offered us free coffee on the house and apologized for the wait. And we weren't even waiting that long! Super nice staff. 

We ordered the classic brekkie which was just your typical eggs/bacon breakfast. Pretty standard. Really good potatoes. 

We also got the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. I am super picky about how my eggs are cooked but the poached eggs were cooked perfectly! My only complaint is that the Hollandaise sauce was a little bit too lemony. 

Overall, I think once they get things going, this place will be a go-to place for coffee and breakfast."}
{"text":"Lovely place to get a coffee. The baristas are very talented and the drinks are high quality. Their breakfast and brunch menus are excellent. They will go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied with your order. If you don't see your drink on the menu ask the barista if they can make one for you."}
{"text":"Tried their eggs benedict with peameal bacon, spinach, etc. and chicken & waffle.... Big fan of the chicken and waffle! They make their own special spicy syrup which is to die for! I would recommend their London fog latte as well! Two thumbs up. Only thing is... limited seating!"}
{"text":"Well... I came here in the winter day. After fight thru the terrible traffic at Hwy 7, and arrived, hoping to get a hot brunch. Then they told me, kitchen close already!!!!! They didn't mention anywhere on the website that they don't severe hot food after 3!!!! I'm very very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon for my friends birthday and it was still pretty packed. Seating is very tight, my friends and I had to wait a while to find a seat. The food came out fairly quickly. I got the salmon eggs benny and it was delicious!l!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I love the food and coffee at Alchemy but the location and seating isn't the most ideal.

At Alchemy, you go up to the counter and make your order then you find a seat in the confined area and the barista brings it over to you once it's ready. Service is always great here but with the limited seating, sometimes it is hard to find a place to sit or even stand around so you're just hovering over other diners hoping they'll leave soon. I'd advise coming really early or on a weekday.

In terms of brunch, it is one of the best you can get in Markham. You can't go wrong with the eggs benedict here. I usually get the smoked salmon. The eggs are always cooked right and the house fries are nice and crispy. I'd also recommend the pork belly omelette."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and tried enough items to give it a proper review. 

This place gets high marks for technique and hype. There's plenty of room for improvement but their core is solid. They make really good coffee and, for the most part, can execute in the kitchen. They seem to have quite the Asian following here as well. 

Where they lack is creativity. With \"alchemy\" in the name, you'd think the opposite. Their coffee is from Pilots downtown, which is a really good coffee. Having a special bean from time to time would be nice. All their menu items are taken directly from popular brunch spots downtown. They can execute it for the most part but they do lack in the details. For one, they're overpriced: all items seem to be 5-10% more expensive than downtown price. Shouldn't it be the opposite here in the suburbs? The food selection is a bit disproportioned: their chicken and waffles comes with 3 drumsticks, no white meat. Compare that to a place like Stockyards or School and you're left disappointed. Also, those places have better chicken and waffles. Their roasted potatoes comes on a lot of dishes is decent in texture and flavour, but is cold when it comes out. My guess is they batch cook it and leave it out. 

Lastly, the space is small and tiny. Forget about bringing kids or a group size larger than 2."}
{"text":"Great new brunch place in Markham.  It's located in a small strip plaza with limited parking.  Nice cozy cafe that gives a very causal and relaxing vibe.  

Food: 
Came with a few friends and tried out the eggs Benedict, chicken waffle, london fog and the regular coffee.  My friend liked the food but thought the regular coffee wasn't strong enough compared to other places.  I liked my eggs benedict and london fog a lot.  I tried a bit of the chicken waffle and liked it even better than my own eggs Benedict. The chicken was nice and crispy and tender on the inside.  The waffle was fresh and good.  The eggs benedict was also very nice, looks as great as it tastes.  Both were yummy.  Will definitely come back again.  

Service/Atmosphere: 
Nice casual atmosphere with high turnover of tables.  The decor of the cafe is very comfortable with its chalk board menu on the wall.  They don't rush you even if there's lots of people.  However, it is small with limited tables.  I believe there is only 2 four-people tables.  Not recommended for big groups."}
{"text":"Big fan of brunch. Got my fix here! Had the Eggs Benny and it was delicious, those potatoes! mmmmm."}
{"text":"We came here for one fine Sunday for our brunch. It's a tiny coffee shop with amazing food and drink. That I would say. They have quite a few items on their menu that would worth a try. We ordered chicken and waffle for myself and eggs Benedict with peameal bacon for my bf. Oh boy. The food is so so so good. I am very picky when it comes down to waffle and pancakes. The waffle batter is light and the outside is crispy. The egg hollandaise sauce is to die for. Creamy and full of flavour. I would recommend for anyone who would like coffee to try their ice coffee. Overall it's was amazing experience. I would suggest to go in when it's not too busy. Good thing to do is call ahead and see how busy they are or actually better yet go to google and type in alchemy coffee and see their graph where is show their busiest hour! ;) you are welcome."}
{"text":"Alchemy is one of the only independent coffee shops in Markham. They make great lattes, cappuccinos, espressos, and cortados. They use coffee beans from Pilot Coffee Roasters. 

They also serve brunch and have a variety of benedicts and open face omelettes ."}
{"text":"Discovered this place by fluke (thanks to Yelp) and my friend and I were pleasantly surprised.  The (small) place is situated in a rather busy plaza so parking is pretty limited.  Of course with its location and size, seating is also quite limited, but diners tend to just have a quick bite.  My friend and I walked in assuming that our orders would be taken until I had to ask one of the workers how to actually place an order.  Even when placing an order, they asked what we were going to drink, which was just water, and they failed to mention that we could also get that ourselves.  So tip to the manager, perhaps have your staff approach customers and ask if this is their first time or just quickly let them know how ordering works.  Would save a lot of time.  As for the food, it was delicious.  Took some time to get it but it was well worth the wait.  

Chicken and Waffles - You get served 3 pieces of drumsticks which were perfectly battered, seasoned and fried.  Came with a side of salad and of course your waffles which were all very good.  One thing I do have to say is that for the price of the dish, would've been nice to have a thigh and drumstick, rather than 3 drumsticks.  We all know drumsticks don't cost very much.  Other than that though, it was very good and I would personally go back for it. 5/5.

Eggs Benedict - After discovering this place on Yelp and seeing all the pictures of their eggs benny, I just had to try it.  If you were to maybe look at the portion and the minimum amount of hollandaise sauce, you may think it was a little overpriced.  They did however also add some cooked spinach and also some avocado which gave it that extra butteriness.  The dish also came with its delicious green salad and also some potatoes (also a little limited).  I'd still come back for it, though.  4/5 (needs more hollandaise sauce!)."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday and ordered the classic brekkie and the braided pork belly open face omelette. Terrific flavours and well seasoned. My girlfriend knows her coffee and was very impressed. It's a rather small dining area so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Definitely my fave brunch spot. Gets busy on weekends (rightfully so). Been here several time with my husband and toddler for brunch we seems to always get the bar seats but That's ok. 
Pilot coffee beans - awesome. 
Had Americanos and lattes and they were great. 
Their london latte and other tea lattes worth trying. 
Brunch food - delicious as always. Can't go wrong with their menu. 
Parking can be tough when it gets busy as some are resevered spots for othet stores."}
{"text":"Food were pretty good. But OMG there's like no seats. Super crowded! Took us ages to find seats. So packed. Not gonna go back to eat because it's way too packed, took my appetite away."}
{"text":"Heard many good things about this place and this was our first time going. We got there Sunday at about 11am and were lucky enough to come in just as a group was leaving. It's a small place with about 6 tables and bar tables along a wall and window. It's a cozy (tight and cramped) restaurant. There's a coat rack at the back which is nice during the winter when you got your winter coat on. There's signage on the door saying you seat yourself. Once you find a seat, you order and pay at the cashier and pour your own water and they bring your food to you. The menu is written on a chalkboard wall. We sat at the bar table on stools. 

For 3 people, the bill with tip came to about $50 which is decent and reasonable for the quality and amount we got. The whole dining experience was about 40mins so this place isn't good for lounging and chatting with a queue starting to form at the door. 

I got the peameal bacon eggs benedict which is good but nothing special, and a matcha latte which was the best part actually. Fiancé got the pork belly open faced omelette which was fine but he thought needed a bit more seasoning on the pork. I thought it lacked acidity because the fatty pork is a little heavy. Perhaps more dressing on the salad would've made up for that. His father ordered the classic brekkie which is 3 eggs with sausages and potatoes which had no complaints. 

Overall this place is okay, and I would come back if there is no wait. Just not sure if the food is worth a half hour wait. There is good family-run brunch place right across the street that's just as good. Food here is okay, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"This is definitely amongst my favourite brunch places. The food was so good, I am planning to go back to try out more of the menu. I had pancake with blueberries and cornflakes - forgot the name with an amazing hazelnut latte. The place itself was quite busy when we went so we considered ourselves lucky when we found some seats. It's a bit cramped but aside from that it was a worth while experience."}
{"text":"Superb ambiance, fantastic coffee, wifi available, just off the highway seven. Found it on Yelp as many other great locations. Love the coffee."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a self-seated, order at the counter and the food is delivered to your table. Despite the low-key spot of the restaurant and the looks of its surroundings, the interior is quite modern and definitely a relaxing spot you could bring a date. The staff are patient, pleasant and take the initiative to making your stay as smooth as possible. The food was not only delivered in speed, but in flavour. I liked that the tipping option isn't shoved in your face when you pay (the machine goes directly to the payment step of the process), allowing you to take in the whole experience before you make that decision. The option of lemon water on the side was also a nice touch. Overall, definitely a place to go if you want to grab a nice brunch that's not going break your wallet."}
{"text":"This is a new coffee joint that opened up recently in Markham. It's located in a small plaza strip on Kennedy Ave by Subway. The parking in this plaza is VERY limited and there's signs everywhere that you're not allowed to park at Subway or they tow your car. There's no parking in the back and when I arrived I actually just made my own parking spot because there was no where to park. The restaurant seating is also very limited. There's 2 tables that seat 4 people, 4 small tables that seat 2 people, and a bar strip seating along the wall that seats 8 individuals.They do not take reservations, it's a first come first serve, grab a table and order your food and sit down kinda place. They do bring out your food to the table, but ketchup, milk, cream, lids, water, and napkins are all on the side for self service. I would recommend just take out if you're in a hurry. 

I'm not a fan of breakfast food, but it was amazing here. I ordered a mocha latte for $4.25. They weighed the coffee beans before brewing my coffee. It was made to perfection. Highly recommended. For food I ordered the buttermilk pancakes for $11 and added a side of house fries for $3. The pancakes were fantastic! It was served with blueberries, cereal, and (watered down) condense milk. My friends ordered the classic breakfast and pork belly open faced omelette and it was enjoyable as well. 

To go I ordered a matcha white chocolate chip cookie. The total cost of it was $2.80 and was totally worth it! Probably one of the best cookies I've ever had!

I would have given this place a 5 star, but the parking and seating is just too poor to give a 5 star overall. I sat at a table of 4 for 3 people and because it was so busy i felt very pressured to leave as well. I would recommend take out!"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert when it comes to Latte and coffee. But I can definitely say that I've had enough cups in my life to say that this place is one of my favourite spot to get my warm drink. The service is always prompt and kind and the latte is always smooth, light and tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious , nice presentation and friendly service. It's like a gem for the community. I ordered a smoked salmon egg Benedict and it was Amazing : ) will come again"}
{"text":"They serve Pilot coffee - a big plus!  Solid food, too. -1 star for limited seating & parking.  A nice find in this area.  Please expand!"}
{"text":"Favourite brunch place in Markham. 4 stars only because it is ALWAYS packed. Seating is limited, be warned that you will need to wait anywhere from 15-40 minutes. They need to upgrade to somewhere more spacious. Every time I have to consider if I would want to wait, but the food is just soooo good!! everything on the menu is good. 

Highly recommend the smoked salmon benedict and the matcha affogato. When I first tried the matcha affogato, I thought it was a drink and got upset cause it was ice cream- it's a dessert (ice cream with liquid matcha), but it was so good!"}
{"text":"Love their coffee and their breakfast, but I wish they offered a couple of vegan choices. It would probably be fantastic."}
{"text":"Came here around 12 on Saturday, the place was busy and you would probably have to wait 10-15minutes for the next seat/table to be free. I came in for coffee so didn't have to wait at all. 

The mocha was pretty good as most chain cafes mocha tend to be very sweet and tastes like chocolate syrup in coffee even though I request less sweet. This mocha wasn't like that at all, maybe because I requested less sweet so it was on the bitter end which I love. 

Saw on Yelp that the matcha cookie was good so decided to order it and give it a try. Oh lord, it was gooooood....so good that i almost finished my cookie before the barista handed me over my drink. I ended up buying another one before leaving lol. 


This is actually my second time coming, last time I tried their brunch which was decent but because the place is quite small and packed, it gets pretty uncomfortable eating while people are hovering around you waiting for you to leave. Also the food gets cold fast because of the constant cold air flow coming from the doors. (Came during winter times) Definitely won't come here to catch up with friends on the weekends as it gets busy. Lost one star because of this."}
{"text":"Food is quite good, not sure if it's worth the wait. Especially the case they don't serve tables, you might run into issues with someone whom doesn't use the honour system."}
{"text":"Love it, will come back.

Pros
- best Benedict I have had so far. (Peameal bacon, avocado, cheddar) I normally don't finish the salad but for theirs I did :)
- great atmosphere, just perfect for brunch
- nice coffee drink selection

Cons
- unlimited parking spots
- $$
- small place/ a bit crowded"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and waffles. The meal suggests I eat chicken and waffles together... My plate comes 15 mins after I order. Chicken tastes amazing. The waffles are overcooked, dry as the desert and hard as bricks. If fact the desert had more moisture than these waffles. I asked for replacement waffles and it's currently 30 mins wait and still no waffles. Chicken is cold now and I've eaten chicken with no waffles. Waffles finally come they are a little bit better... I guess i can say I had chicken with a side order of waffles."}
{"text":"Ordered the decently high stack of buttermilk pancakes with mixed berries, cereal flakes, and side of condensed milk.  Hadn't thought to serve pancakes with condensed milk before, but it turned out to be a pretty tasty mix!  The chai latte was strongly chai flavoured. Downsides: The insane rush of people at around 11:30am on Saturday morning meant a very tight crowd of people waiting at the door, which meant hungry, waiting people basically hovering over the tables in an already-tiny, cramped dining space.  The ordering process/service was a bit confusing: You order at the front til, and if you order food, they'll serve it to you at whatever table you manage to grab - but aside from dropping food off at your table, there's no actual service.  For a brunch of three people with tips, the total came up to about $70."}
{"text":"I never got coffee at Alchemy Coffee... but I did get the smoked salmon eggs benny and it was great!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice and cozy, warm and pretty hip. Perfect for Instagram photos. 

The waiting however is at least 30 mins, there are only about 30 spots in the restaurant and it's always packed. They don't take reservations. The restaurant is selfseating so if you see a spot just grab it. You also have to go up yourself to place your orders so don't just keep waiting around to be served. 

$14 - Eggs Benny Smoke salmon (RECOMMEND)
pretty good benedict, quite standard and average though.

$13 - Eggs Benny Peameal, avacado (RECOMMEND) 
I liked this a bit more than the salmon actually, nice crunchy taste which adds to a nice sensation. 

$4.25 - Hot Matcha Tea Latte. Would not recommend. It needs more flavour and I think they skimped out on the matcha. I actually think the green tea latte from second cup is better."}
{"text":"Come here every week, love the atmosphere. Food is amazing, try their buttermilk pancake"}
{"text":"Alchemy is a tiny place, so at 2:00pm there's a little line up for brunch. Very cramped seating. The tables are so close together... it's like your sharing your space with strangers. Otherwise you sit at the
counter along the wall. 

The Chicken and Waffles $15 are always good here. The chicken legs were hot and crunchy. The waffles were moist & crispy on the outside My Eggs Beny $14 with peameal bacon, Spinach and Guac spread was just OK today. The food came not hot... seems they waited for the Chicken and Waffles to come out together. So the English muffin was a little soggy and I bearly tasted the guacamole spread on the bread. I think it would have been nice to see a big gallop of Guac on the side. Although the eggs came out runny which is how I like it. 

I found the menu is overpriced for this type of place and service. Most of the entrees were in the $13 to $15 price range. Expensive for a menu that's not that special to me. 

I would go back here for brunch only because there's not a lot of choices in Markham."}
{"text":"First brunch place in Markham from what I know of! I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict every time I've went - been there twice. VOID THE SALAD AT ALL COSTS. The spring salad tasted greasy despite asking for sauce on the side - it just left my lips feel icky and coated with something. Costs about $20 for breakfast and coffee. Service was alright, decent amount of tables. All in all, I've had better at other places but it is okay for \"Markham\" standards due to the lack of Western brunch places available. If you had brunch downtown then you will be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I had a latte at the coffee shop and it was really good.  There aren't too many seats and parking is a bit limited.  Lighting is dim but for me it's more an \"order your coffee and go\" kinda place. I also bought a bag coffee beans there ( pilot coffee) and the quality is quite good."}
{"text":"I was here for breakfast at 9 on a Saturday. Parking was no problem but there was no seats available. Waited about 10-15 minutes until I finally got a table. You can't order ahead of time while you're waiting for a table.. which I guess makes sense. After finally grabbing a seat, I waited EXACTLY 30 minutes for my food to come out and 15 minutes for my drink. I mean.. if you have that time to waste, then no problem. 

I've tried the Mocha($4.25) and both the Eggs Benny Peameal Bacon with Avocado($14?) and the Eggs Benny with Smoked Salmon. The eggs benny comes with a side of salad and home fries. Both were great but I would prefer the smoked salmon more. The peameal bacon was too.. much work. It was difficult to cut. Mocha, no complaints. Like every other mocha. The portions are pretty big.

Service was okay. 
Waiting time took too long.
Food is good."}
{"text":"While I was looking Starbucks, I passed by this new cafe.  The outside look made me wanna try their coffee.  So I gave it a shot and ordered two flat white.  It turned out to be very nicely done with a little latte art on the top.  First sip was smooth and not too roasted like the big box store.  I haven't got a chance to try food not sure what the quality is.  From a coffee store perspective, I think you really did a good job.  Like the environment, small and cozy."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what all the hype is about with this place. Sure, it is Instagram worthy but that's about it. I came in here with my sister today (Saturday 9:45 am) and there were a few seats left on the long tables. We ordered the salmon benny and the peameal bacon benny, along with two lattes. The lattes came quickly and tasted great. The bennies on the other hand took forever to arrive. I saw them serve the couple next to us, who came in 15 mins after us, benny dishes and their lattes (exact order as us!) before our food arrived. Then I saw this table of about 4+ people, who also came in after us, got served their benny dishes before us! 

I turned back to see the employees confused and holding one benny dish. What do ya know? It was the benny for me. They said my sister's dish was on its way but we waited about 10 mins before I went up to the counter to ask if they had given our orders to another table in which he replied yes but my sister's order is coming. When we finally got my sister's order, my peameal bacon and English muffin was already chewy. Overall, I don't think it was worth $40+ for this breakfast experience."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to have a coffee and lunch.  Friendly service, fairly priced, and food is amazing.  What else can you ask for?

{"text":"Not much to say lol, this is a place with a solid rep for good quality brunch. I had the pork belly omelette and boy it was amazing!! only down side is that the place is tiny and that you'll have a hard time finding the basically non existent parking spots, most people just park on the side of the strip plaza. But definitely don't let that turn you away from trying this place."}
{"text":"Firstly, the food was about $2-3 more expensive than you would expect, but in my support of local, non-chained businesses, I overlooked this and found the rest of my experience enjoyable.  

Alchemy Coffee is at the end of a somewhat ignored plaza along Highway 7 and you likely have driven by this same plaza without even glancing.  Lots of parking since the plaza is not busy at all.  Once you step inside, you are welcomed by homey/hipster decor of wooden tables and edison light bulbs hanging overhead.  There's no service - rather, you order at the counter and the food/drinks gets brought to you.  The menu is written by hand on a chalk board to your right which lists less than 10 options for food and quite a few more drinks.  

My eggs benedict came with a side of home fries and salad.  The portions are not big, and while I can see that this might not be enough for people with a bigger appetite, but it's just right for me.  I actually enjoyed their drink more than the food and really liked their matcha latte.

While seating is somewhat limited and probably not a good place for a big party, this seems like a good place for someone to go (even alone) and sit for a while.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been full since early morning all the time. I took advantage of the ice storm to drop by to see if I would be at any luck. I ordered an Egg Benedict with Smoked Salmon and Portabella mushrooms and a cup of matcha latte. 

Matcha Latte came shortly after I had placed my order. The latte art was elegant. The drink is sweet even though no sugar was added. I believe the sweetness came from the milk. The latte tastes awesome!

Then the Egg Benedict arrived. The waiter was smart to bring an extra plate to the table for me to share the course with my husband. It came with salad and potatoes. The greens for the salad are fresh and the potatoes are sweet, not artificially sweet by adding sugar but the natural sweetness came from the vegetable. They are crispy and hoThe eggs were just right, as you slid your knife on top of the egg white, the york overflew. The chef is quite generous with the portabella mushrooms. The combination of all ingredients tasted just right in harmony. Only one minor negative thing to say that I was hoping the Benedict could be a bit warmer, perhaps it's just my personal preference, it may be just perfect to others."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, amazing food, amazing service! The perfect place for brunch uptown!

If you have the patience, it's totally worth the wait. Everyone is friendly and the food keeps us coming back! Great prices for generous portions. Definitely way better than Cora's or Eggsmart

Chicken and Waffle, Pork Belly Omelette and Peameal
Bacon Eggs Benedict are all highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I live for aesthetically pleasing cafes, just take all my money!!! Alchemy Coffee is one of them, tucked in a little plaza just a little west of Main Street Unionville & Highway 7. It's very representative of those bougie cafe joints you'd find in Toronto, which is great for those who wanna save the trip of going all the way downtown. 

Upon arrival, it was a lot smaller than my friends and I expected and the lighting was quite dim (FYI Alchemy, we need good lighting out here to take pics!!!). Yet, the interior was designed to fit a modern style cafe, which was cute - wooden tables and chairs, black & grey walls...

The food and drinks itself were also quite pricey - I ended up paying around $20 for a matcha latte and smoked salmon eggs benny. However, the presentation of the food was on par and I loved their hollandaise sauce they used for their eggs Benedict. I also liked how they added some greens to make it look healthier LOL. Not to mention, I love when they serve up my lattes with some latte art (I got a heart heheh) 

I'll definitely want to come back here to try the other dishes that have been recommended by many friends and fellow Yelpers - such as the chicken & waffle or the iced version of the matcha latte, as well as their coffee!!!"}
{"text":"This is the only place for brunch in Markham that I go to. It's your best option for brunch besides Coras, Eggsmart and Eggs for Life. They serve Pilot beans which is great! They also sell their beans in bags well. I ordered the eggs benny which is their speciality. I've gotten their pancakes before which were pretty good, but I would say the eggs benny were better. The problem is how small the place is and the limited amount of parking in the parking lot. It's a self serve type of restaurant where you order at the counter, pay first and they serve you at your table. But water and etc is all done by yourself."}
{"text":"Alchemy Coffee serves good food but has very limited seating.

Pros: really enjoyed the smoked salmon eggs benny and open face pork belly omlette.  Tasty and came with salad and homefries.  Good portion size and food was served promptly.

Cons: the line up to pay and line up to get a seat is very confusing.  There's no real order to this process, especially with the seating.  Would suggest the following for the company: order food first, get a bill with ticket #.  Have a line up for seating after food ticket is obtained.  Serve food once client is seated.

I would come back again, but probably during a less busy time of day."}
{"text":"Cute brunch spot in the Markham area located in a strip plaza off highway 7.

Came by for brunch on the weekend and ordered the smoked salmon benny while he got the classic breakfast. I really enjoyed the benny and my cappuccino and him, his breakfast. I wanted to try their chicken and waffle but heard that the chicken is a little dry.. 

I'm unsure if I'll return just for the benny. The cafe is small and can be difficult to get a seat and the parking lot is even smaller so not sure if it's worth the trip for eggs benny."}
{"text":"Top notch pilot coffee. Had the braised pork belly omelette and a flat white. Really really good.  The beet salad was also really good."}
{"text":"My best friend wanted to try out this place so I said sure, why not since I like going out for breakfast. 

When I got there, there was very few parking spots available since the plaza is very small with limited parking spots. I guess during peak hours you gotta wait or make your own parking space? Thankfully I found one. When we walked in, we noticed the sign that said the place is self seating. So we went ahead and found a spot. Mind you, if it's busy, you have to stand around and wait (unless if you do take out), which is pretty awkward since this place is REALLY small. 

The menu is on the wall which was kind of awkward for us to look at since we were sitting literally below the menu. Once we figured out what we wanted, we went up to the cashier to order and pay. I ordered the eggs benny with smoked salmon and a matcha tea latte to drink. My friend ordered the same but an eggs benny with peameal bacon. It didn't take too long for the food to come. 

The food was REALLY good. No complaints whatsoever. The eggs benny came with home fries and a salad. I actually couldn't finish everything so I saved one of my eggs benny and brought it home for my boyfriend to try since he was jealous lol. 

I will definitely be back here! My friend even said she wants to go there and order to go before she heads to work every once in awhile."}
{"text":"So let's get the negatives out of the way right off the hop - it's cozy (aka tiny) so your odds of getting a seat during busier times (especially once this place becomes THE cool spot to be) will be limited. Also, as this is a small shop located in smaller strip mall, the parking is even more limited.

Now that we got all that out of the way, let's get to the reasons you're reading this review! As others have mentioned, it's great to see an indie coffee shop open in Markham - I really don't think I could deal with and BBT spot - sorry, not sorry. And it's good! These guys are basically coffee geeks and I love it! Top of the line brewing machines and methods and they even take great care to ensure that their ratios (water to bean) are perfect - they were weighing the coffee and water before making my latte!

I ordered a latte with an extra shot of espresso - so it had a serious jolt to it! Usually I find Lattes to be more focused on drowning out the coffee with excessive milk, wacky flavours and designs in an effort to distract you from how shitty what you're drinking is (ahem - starbucks take note). This latte was the real deal, bold coffee flavour, perfect level of bitter balanced with milk and no flavours needed! 

They're apparently famous for their matcha white chocolate chip cookies and given that match is all da rage... I raged and got one. Matcha isn't my fave but this was actually really really good. The white chocolate and the cookie base combined to level out that chalkiness that matcha can sometimes create in your mouth. This was defo more cookie flavour than green tea powder.

After sipping and snacking I knew I was gonna need a lunch... so I ordered breakfast. Yep, this place also doubles as an all day breakie/brunch spot. I went with their open faced pork belly omelette and let me tell you, wow just wow. The pork belly and cheese were cooked perfectly and served atop an open omelette in a tiny black skilled very cool. I do have to say though, the omelette portion was undercooked and still runny and as an expert home omelette maker - that's a disgusting no-no for me and something the staff should be aware of. It can also be a health risk if part of the uncooked egg has something wrong with it. 

Great spot though with free wifi and a lot of passion behind the counter. You'll find me here regularly now when I'm in need of a stiff caffeinated beverage and some keyboard time!

{"text":"Woot I love their flat white coffee! Stumbled upon this random cafe while driving by it. I tried their eggs benny and I really didn't like it. Probably because I was spoiled by my favourite brunch places from downtown Toronto. Went again and tried their open face omelettes, and was really impressed. My fiance ordered the pork belly omelette, while I got the bacon goat cheese one. Really good! Although I couldn't finish it because it was a bit too much for me to D: I suggest coming early, cause it does get busy here and you have to find a spot to sit before ordering food."}
{"text":"Probably the only place that has eggs bennies available on a weekday in Markham (that I know of). Really delicious! Their salmon eggs benny is simple but filling enough for me. Comes with yummy potatos and salad on the side. Matcha latte could be better though, not enough matcha flavour. Their chicken&waffles were not bad, I noticed a lot of people order it. The waffle itself was crispy and soft, and the fried chicken is juicy and crispy. Overall not bad of a breakfast/brunch place other than the fact that there's literally little to no parking. Place is also very small and usually packed. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Finally got to try alchemy coffee, and boy was it a mission. Only after FOUR times coming here were we able to snag a table. Usually we come in, see that all tables are full, and then head down the road to Smash Kitchen for brunch because I'm too hangry to wait for a table before I've eaten my first meal of the day. But not this time! This time my boyfriend and I woke up early, got there before 10:30 AND there was a snow storm. And hurrah, due to all these factors we managed to grab the last table. 

Seriously. If you want a table for brunch and don't want to awkwardly wait for one in the corner right next to someone's table (the place is so small), then you have to wake up early :( (sucks, I know). Also, if you didn't know you have to seat yourselves like a cafe and you just wait in the front awkwardly, the guys working there won't tell you anything. They just stare at you and then keep working. 

Anyway on to the food... I got the smoked salmon eggs benny and it was delicious! I hate capers and this one didn't have any so even better. The potatoes are tasty and the salad is a nice contrast.

My boyfriend had the open faced omelette with pork belly and that was amazing too. Usually I'm not a big fan of pork belly but this one was done right. 

I would definitely come back if I do end up waking up early one day. I'm eyeing those pancakes everyone else on Yelp posts pictures ..."}
{"text":"It's about time Markham got a joint like this.

I was very impressed by all the pictures of the food here, definitely ig-worthy but the true test was if the taste could stand up to some of the top brunch places you typically find downtown.  I can say with confidence that you will not be disappointed.

Don't let the self-seating, ordering/paying at the counter, and menu on the wall fool you, this place is legit. I enjoyed quality ingredients used for classic dishes with the chef's own creative concoctions. The smoked salmon egg benny was perfectly paired with portobello mushroom, kale and of course hollandaise sauce.  I hear the braised pork belly open faced omelette skillet and chicken n waffles are also a must-try (damn this belly for not being able to fit more food).  But the champ of the morning was the blueberry & cereal buttermilk pancakes served with a milk sauce dressing (i'm drooling as I'm typing this).  The coffee is not your run of the mill brew either.  They use pilot coffee beans and the cortado was a nice compliment to the matcha white chocolate cookie (ask for it to be warmed up).  

The place is small, and seats are close together but who cares. It's worth the lineup during peak hours as table become available quickly. The service is top notch too.  My friend has a lot of dietary restrictions which weren't a problem for them, they were able to customize the order.  4.5 'nom nom' stars."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today at around 12 30 ish. The cafe is located at a small store on highway 7 ( close to kennedy). Parking was kind of tough, there wasn't a lot of parking spots available.

We walked in to the cafe, it's kind of like a self served seating- You find your own seat and then place your order at the counter.

The menu is pretty good with lots of options.
Egg bennys, omelettes, pancakes, chicken & waffles, coffee, tea etc.

We had the smoke salmon egg benny with house salad and potatoes. The benny is better here because they added portabello mushrooms!! Soo yummy!
We also ordered the buttermilk pancakes with mixed berries. The pancakes are super fluffy and it's a pretty big portion.

Overall the food is great! Nice to have this type of cafe in markham. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Location/Service:
Small parking lot as it is located within a small plaza.  It's on Hwy #7, between Birchmount/Kennedy (close to the railway tracks).  Big header sign, so you can't really miss it.

Inside has a very nice ambient feeling - a mix of wooden and modern furniture.  Free-wifi (and strong) is available, along with plugs by the wall if you need to bring a laptop.

The owners were very friendly and knowledgeable on what kind of food/drinks they offer.  
Pricing is reasonable as this is a more of a local coffee shop, it makes it a little special/different.  

I went on a Friday for brunch, so there were less people.  It is often more busy during weekends - and since it's newly opened, service can range; but I can see they are doing their best.


Food:
Cappuccino - smooth and not too heavy.  It's good for my tasting - even to the bottom, where it's usually a little more bitter.  The owners try doing some latte art, pretty cute - but I know they're not great experts on it.

Salmon Eggs Benedict - portion size is perfect for quick lunch/brunch.  I personally like Benedict and this one doesn't fail.  Runny eggs and fresh salmon.  The salad on the side is with a vinaigrette dressing.  Roasted potato wedges were a little salty for me - I think they added a little too much salt.


Overall, I really enjoy this place and would love to come again to try their other drinks/food.
They do have a wide selection of food if you want to come here for a brunch.

Seating is a little limited cause it's not a big coffee place - but small = cozy!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon with my boyfriend and we absolutely loved it! It was cozy and comforting. We got the chicken and waffles and open face shrimp omelette. The spicy sauce that came with the chicken and waffles was the perfect combination! We will definitely return very soon!"}
{"text":"Came here in the morning on a week day. 

Pros 

Looks nice on the inside 
Employees are polite. 

Cons 
Everything is fairly overpriced given there are other breakfast places in the area for half the cost."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere, innovative menus. Easy to find. Ordered pork belly omelette and brekki."}
{"text":"Both the food and coffee are pretty good, but I would probably not return for brunch again.  The dining experience was subpar. Before coming here I had no idea that this was a coffee shop but not a diner/restaurant. There are no waiters, so customers have to find their own table and go to the counter to order. The coffee shop was over-crowded when we got there due to limited seating. We sat close to the door, and we felt rushed because there were people standing right next to us the whole time. Personally I think the dining experience is just as important as the food itself. I will go to a restaurant for brunch next time."}
{"text":"This place offers pretty decent latte and food. It's a gem in the Markham neighborhood.  However, the self service seating is an issue sometimes given how busy this place is. For example, my hubby and I went there on Sunday, there were two ladies occupied the middle two seats of the four seats in the bar seatings. Guess what she claimed one of the empty seats to put her coat and the table for her purse ( really, her purse is that expensive that it needs a spot on the table to be displayed) . Those two other seats could have served two other customers that were in line. I don't understand why the staff there didn't make a comment on that.  The staff could have managed the seating issue in a better way."}
{"text":"For $10 standard breakfast I was satisfied. Their potatoes are well-seasoned and blew me away with the flavour. We waited a few minutes - say 10, before finding a seat and decided to order. Service was standard, ambiance was loud, and actually wished they had a bigger space. Parking was tricky but hopefully they open up another location soon to alleviate the problem. My only suggestion would be to come early."}
{"text":"Get yourself and your dining company here for
Right at the Opening time to get yourself a seat! 

This place is tiny, I kid you not. The food is delicious . The coffee is perfect. It is your quintessential brunch place perfectly situated in Markham. 

The chicken and waffles? GOOD. The sauce comes in cute mini mason jars. The eggs benny? YUM!

The downside? Limited seating. I'm serious if it opens at 9? Try to get there for 9. Otherwise you'll awkwardly wait in line. On that note, as a diner, I do feel a little bit awkward sitting comfortably to catch up with friends and have have long conversations during my meal."}
{"text":"Food was okay...my veggie bennie was warm and not hot..coffee was good...environment was nice ..great place for coffee and studying"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --

When I noticed there was a new brunch cafe in Markham, I was super excited because I am a sucker for brunch. The cafe had a modern dark rustic theme and most of their furniture was made of wood. When I walked in I was immediately greeted by the store associate. I asked him for recommendations and he told me the egg benedict was a bestseller. I ordered a Smoked salmon, portabello mushroom and kale Eggs Benny (which came with a house fries and salad) and a hot mocha. 

-- Food and Drink --

1. Smoked salmon, portabello mushroom and kale Eggs Benny (which came with a house fries and salad) $14 - Love it! It's one of the better ones in town for sure! The English muffin was toasted perfectly. When I cut through the poached eggs, the hollandaise sauce combined with the runny egg yolk soaked up the muffin. Their smoked salmon and salad tasted very fresh. The potato wedges were very crunchy and was seasoned perfectly. The portabello mushroom had a strong aroma and tasted so good! 

2. Hot Mocha (12ounces) $4.25 + $0.75 for soy milk -  Very hot and the coffee taste wasn't too bitter. I liked how they had the option to switch to soy milk.  

-- Overall --

I was very impressed with their service. The store associate (actually I believed he might be the owner) remembered their return customers. I overheard him greeting an old couple and he was telling them he remembered them visiting the cafe before. He even remembered what they ordered before. This personalized and welcoming service allows customers to have a unique experience.  I would give them a 5-star for my overall experience. 1-star off because the egg benny was quite pricey. After knowing about this brunch place in Markham, with quality as good as the ones around Liberty Village, I will definitely revisit this cafe for sure!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday morning around 11 am and expected a wait because of the small seating area available at Alchemy. However, we were lucky to be seated at a table by the wall for two in about 10 mins. 

While waiting for a seat we looked at the menu and knew exactly what we wanted to order, so once we sat down one of us got up to the counter and put in our food and drink orders. 

I opted for the classic breakfast with sausage, over easy eggs and whole wheat toast along with a brewed coffee in a to go cup. Overall I really enjoyed the breakfast and thought that the portion was very reasonable for the price. The coffee was strong and hit the spot. I was quite surprised to see that they served Pilot coffee and was quite excited about this because I've tried Pilot coffee from the little shop in union station and loved their brews. I'm happy that I can grab some pilot coffee brew uptown on weekends :)

My friend opted for the smoked salmon Benny and a cappuccino which she quite enjoyed as well. She couldn't finish the potatoes and salad though as it was quite a bit of food. 

Overall a great brunch spot but I gave it 4 stars because of the location and the seating available. Will come back sometime to try other items and their lattes."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5 

A cute little coffee shop that's opened up in Unionville with growing popularity meant I had to check it out. I visited Alchemy Coffee on a Wednesday afternoon for brunch. Right on entering, I noticed how tiny this place was, with the menu on the wall on the left and the cash right in front .

We ordered the roasted veggie eggs Benny and the buttermilk pancakes. You order at the front and then take a seat wherever you'd like and they bring out the food for you. You also pay when you order so it gets a bit confusing with tipping. There's lemon water available at the side where people can help themselves as well.

The food came out fairly quickly and you could tell it was made fresh based on how it tastes. The pancakes were hot and fluffy and the creamy condensed milk sauce added the perfect amount of sweetness to the dish. The blueberry sauce cut the sweetness as they were quite tarte and the cereal added texture to the dish. Overall, really good! The eggs Benny was also hot and fresh and quite a big portion, you got two eggs and a side salad and a large helping of roasted potatoes. 

I would visit Alchemy Coffee again, for the drinks especially. I was peeping over at the other tables and could tell the drinks were made with care and patience; the latte art was so cute! They also had an array of pastries at the front including green tea cookies and croissants."}
{"text":"It's a nice change to the Markham brunch scene. 

One of the newer additions to Markham's amazing food selection is Alchemy Coffee. It's a cute, small restaurant that only holds about 10 tables. The wait is quite long, so be prepared to wait if you come in prime hours. 

Seats are self served so go ahead and pick a spot. Once you're settled in, head to the front to place the order. They'll bring the food to your table once it's ready. 

We ordered the classic breakfast and the pea-meal bacon eggs Benedict. Both were delicious and reasonably priced. The potatoes in particular were very tasty. 

It wasn't the best brunch I've ever had, but it really was quite good. Planning to come back soon to try the other offerings, especially the pancakes and chicken + waffles. 

Will update this review."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

Definitely a great place for brunch and coffee for those in the Markham area. Been here when they had their initial soft opening a while back but did not try their brunch until recently.

Lattes - Texture and frothing is on point. Almost porcelain-like which is the proper way to serve it. These guys do take their coffees and lattes seriously which is greatly appreciated. Flavour and depth is decent though I would prefer it to be a bit more intense as the taste is slightly more towards the milkier end of the spectrum though still better than most independent coffee shops.

Smoked Salmon Benedict - Decent offering accompanied with a nicely prepared salad that is lightly dressed as well as a side of baked new potatoes that is lightly crisp and well seasoned on the outside. I also liked how they used portobello mushrooms along with the smoke salmon. Egg was on perfectly prepared with a nice and runny yolk. One negative was the English muffin base which could have been crispier on the edges. I found it to be a bit soft and under toasted."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe for brunch w friends. Great decor and cozy atmosphere, though during weekend hours it gets really busy so be prepared to do some waiting for tables to free up (the place is really small with few tables)! Coffee was well priced. Eggs benny was good (eggs cooked to that runny yolk goodness) but a bit pricey...tried both the peameal bacon and smoked salmon. The flavours of the toppings (avocado/portobello mushroom/kale etc) kind of got drowned out by the egg, so would've liked more texture in the food. Potatoes were well seasoned but some were too soft, and some undercooked. Would like to update review after trying their other food!"}
{"text":"Good place to go to if you into latte art but it is a hit or miss with their latte arts. Not always 100%. Also offer food item here but to get a seat is pretty hard at this place, always seem to have line up when I go. Just a FYI they only serve food until 3pm after that only drinks available until 6pm. 
Price wise it's a bit on the higher end"}

{"text":"General experience: Good vibe. Nice place for coffee and brunch.

What I had: Eggs Benny with roasted veggies with espresso machiato. 

The Benny came with salad and potato. Loved the potato, moist and slightly crispy on the outside. You can tell it wasn't kept heated for a long time. Salad was underdressed. The egg Benny was poached with a cup. :( Otherwise, it was poached perfectly. The vegetable and brie with the egg was a great idea. Maybe veggie can be a bit sweeter to balance out that mild bitter undertone of the brie. 

Food is 3/5. The atmosphere is relaxing and casual which bumped the rating up to 4/5."}
{"text":"I love this place minus the lack of space and wait if you come after 11am (even on a Monday). 

My partner and I have been here before and we have had the eggs bennies (both the pea meal bacon and smoke salmon ones) as well as the pancakes. I HIGHLY recommend the pea meal bacon eggs benny one of THE BEST I've ever had (the saltiness of the peameal bacon against the creamy yolk and the seasoned avocado spread is divine). The pancakes are not as good as Mildred Temple but if you're not willing to go down that far for superior pancakes these pancakes could reign supreme in Markham at least to my knowledge. 

Menu Alert !!!: They now have pasta in modest size serving for your female dining companion that insist on sharing a plate as a single meal for lunch, when  you could clearly eat one just for yourself. 

My partner got the carbonara after having flipped a coin (because she couldn't decide). The pasta is little past Al Dente is lightly enough sauced and is topped with a poached egg, so that as you cut into it you get the creaminess you expect out of a carbonara. The bacon is one the saltier side but balances out the creamy and milder taste of the rest of the dish. 

I got the chicken and waffles and I must say not bad (slight applause for Alchemy). This is not a mind blowing dish by any means but just a well cooked version of what you would expect of chicken and waffles. The chicken has a nice crispy flaky crust that seals in the fatty juiciness of the chicken drumstick. The seasoning is on the slight side so those that are used to a heavier handed seasoning may not detect it (usually that's me but I've been trying to cut back on my salt intake ). The waffles have that crispy enough exterior that they offer a crunch while also providing you a soft interior. The spicy sauce accompanying is on the sweet side, not like maple syrup sweet but sweeter than the name suggest. There is almost no hint of spiciness until you get those little tickles of it and then it's gone again. Confusing this sauce is (as Yoda might say). I also appreciate that little bit of a salad they add because it's well dressed not too much and too little, and it helps to contrast against the sweetness of the waffle and syrup and the fattiness of the chicken. (Btw I am not a huge fan of chicken and waffles as I like them both but don't quite see the need to eat them together but I'll try them occasionally whenever I see them.)

Another solid visit, a new discovery and if you are looking for my partner's review of our first visit please search for Robecca Ma, you can't miss her with her unique name. 

Service is closer to a regular coffee cafe where you order and the servers doesn't necessarily come to serve your table but the barista remembers your order and brings out you food and drinks. Also if you could help them with bussing your own dishes. Although if you don't they also do that after you've left your mess at their tables. I don't know just friendly advice from a server."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a bite to eat but there's limited seating and you kind of have to find your own seat, then stand up to go order. Not a bad system but it is a tight space. 

The cereal pancakes is top notch and definitely the only thing I liked from the breakfast menu --everything else seemed pretty standard to any regular breakfast. The coffee was good but not as amazing as I would have expected from a joint that specializes in coffee. 

Overall, I would come again just for the cereal pancakes and maybe a coffee."}
{"text":"Very small cafe.... self seating...had to wait 20min+ for a seat. Less than 50 seats and limited parking
Food is amazing! Pork omelette...yumm... 
Definitely would come back again!!"}
{"text":"Never had chicken and waffles before. This was great. They make they own sauce to have with the dish which was a treat. Never really bother with maple syrup at all. It is a small quaint location. I think this would be great for breakfast or brunch dishes. It can get busy around lunchtime. But it adds to the atmosphere. The staff were very courteous and helpful. The menu can be view as lacking variety but a small place like this you concentrate on the dishes that you do best. I would suggest trying it out because it is a very welcoming atmosphere. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch as I was in Markham area and damn this is THE BEST brunch spot by far, especially for hangovers. 

Their coffee (americano) is a 5/5; says my friend who ordered it as I don't do coffee hahahah (Also didn't try it).

I ordered the Buttermilk Pancakes topped w/ mixed berries & cereals and homg 11/7 they were SO FLUFFY, CLOUDLIKE BITES OF HEAVEN. Like okay just come here and try them. You top them off with diluted condensed milk (go easy on the sugar in the morning okay lmao) and have those sweet yet tart berries with the crispy cereal flakes and cloud like pancakes in one bite... BAM. KO this early in the morning? Oh man this is a must try brekky moreso than brunch.

My friend ordered the Chicken & Waffles w/ Spicy Sauce. The chicken was SO JUICY like I'm talking real Korean Chicken Crispy on the outside and just SPILLING with Juices on the inside. The waffle was also nice and fluffy and crispy and the spicy sauce that you dip it in was a whole different flavour conbination that I've never tried before. Like it was a great kinda WOAW THATS WIERD BUT GOOD WEird you know? Great for brunch and hangovers.

Will definately come back anytime I'm in Markham for brekky/lunch! Thank you so much guus for having us :)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to visit this place for some time now and did it live up to the hype?  Well, let's take a dive.

Parking
If parking at Pacific Mall is a nightmare, then please multiply this experience x 10 lols.  There are so few parking spots, I attempted to park where no lines were placed and realized I could have been given a ticket.  Much to my surprise, I had the best luck that day and quickly found a legit parking spot.  I don't think this restaurant knew it would be this popular, because this location is every Asian's enemy.

Service
I wish the restaurant actually posted a sign that says \"Self-Serve\".  I don't think Ontario has followed this trend for most shops/restaurants.  Therefore, letting people know that it's first come first serve, and that you are expected to grab your own table would be beneficial.  I think it's quite misleading and is something that can be solved easily.  Please, do something lols.

Food
Amazing.  This is why the restaurant deserves recognition.  The omelette with pork belly is to die for.  I love the presentation, its taste, the temperature, everything.  Two double thumbs up.  My friends were happy with their food as well.  Gosh, I want to hire their chef and put him/her in a bigger restaurant lols.

I'd come back, but only if I don't need to line up lols.  The average wait time on a Sunday morning is like 30-50 minutes."}
{"text":"Located in the middle of markham, this cute, down-to-earth cafe is quite pact for the most part yet decently quiet. It is kept tidy and you go up and order rather than being served at your seat. Food and drinks are average with friendly staffs."}
{"text":"The pork belly brunch was amazing! We loved the small place but the waiting and line up was worth it!

Overall, great food but it's busy on the weekend, so spare some time before you go in!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here for Saturday brunch. You need to pay for your order first before eating, pretty much like how you order in the fast-food restaurant. 

I had peameal bacon eggs benny. The eggs were perfectly poached, with two chunky pieces of bacons, spinach and avocado underneath, healthy and delicious. My friend had smoked salmon eggs benny, and she loved it too.

As for drinks, we both ordered matcha latte, beautiful and tasty. The server/cashier guy was very nice too. Like this tiny but cozy place."}
{"text":"This place is located conveniently near hwy 7 area close to markville mall. The eggs Benedict and salmon breakfast dish was definately the top dish! This place is always packed so be ready to wait for a spot especially on weekends. The salmon was super fresh and the salad was delicious. It is a casual environment so you pay before you eat and than you just leave. There are drinks and water on the side for anyone who is thirsty with refills."}
{"text":"What a hidden little hipster coffee shop. :) Simple menu but great taste. Had the eggs benny with peameal bacon, spinach, avocado and cheddar and it was absolutely delicious. But my favourite thing on thay plate was the potatoes! I'd love to try the chicken and waffles next."}
{"text":"So happy to find a new, local coffee shop that has the coffee and food to back it up! Just down the street from my house, this coffee shop is definitely in a great spot to get some attention!

The location seems to be in a nice spot, though a little harder to notice if you aren't paying attention. Parking does seem to be limited here, so you may want to take that into consideration when coming.
The small space inside is masked by the beautifully modern decor and excellent use of space. With a good 6 tables and 2 high-top bar areas, you can definitely find yourself a seat. As mentioned, the decor was great, with a wood plank wall and filament lights, everything was simple yet stunning. 

The coffee here was absolutely amazing and the food was creative and delicious. The Iced Coffee was great, and came in a cute mason jar as well. The Espresso Macchiato was strong and had a kick, but still very good!
The Eggs Benny's all sounded amazing, but the Peameal Bacon one definitely lived up to 'eggs-pectation'! The Classic Brekkie was quite good as well.

The staff there were amazing, informative, and very friendly. Made sure everything was good, and tried to get to know you as well!

Definitely a worthwhile visit and I will definitely be back for more! Great eggs and coffee, what more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"This place is in a bit of a tough spot. There is very little foot traffic going to their shop, but they are so worth going out of your way for. Today I popped in for the first time in months and they had this Matcha White Chocolate cookie. It was a tad on the sweet side, so it's best if you have your coffee without sugar, but the flavours just blend together so well. It was also soft and delicious. I was really impressed.

I saw a ton of people eating the breakfasts, which looked great, but I haven't tried them out yet.

I went in my pjs and they didn't give me any weird looks."}
{"text":"Their chicken and waffles ($15) are great, and less expensive than what I considered to be the reigning Markham chicken and waffles spot, Inspire Restaurant ($17), 10 minutes away.  There were only two pieces of chicken though, both drumsticks, which I found to be too little. While I wish it came with syrup in addition to their spicy sauce (or maybe a new sauce that incorporates syrup), the taste is a home run.

The open-faced omelette with braised pork belly, grilled onions, and swiss chard is frankly too small of a portion for any regular-sized human, but they do a good job with the classic eggs benny. 

My only issue with the place is the limited seating. It's incredibly busy during brunch, so if you're sitting near the door, you pretty much eat with people hovering over you. They're doing the best with the space they have, but it's not exactly a comfortable atmosphere when it's so crowded. 

If you don't mind a little more crowded spot, the food is good."}
{"text":"Alchemy is amazing !!! They serve breakfast/ brunch until 3:00 Pm daily! I worked right across the street at Markham Infiniti so this was my go to lunch spot every day! The service - impeccable!! No complaints. The food - same thing !!! Druel worthy  I recommend their matcha latte (as pictured below) or their chicken and waffles !!! But what's also good on the menu is their spinach and goat cheese salad, the house made dressing is my fave!! Or their Florentine eggs Benny . My only issue with Alchemy was their lack of seating space. The place is small and REALLYYY good so often times they're full and there's no where to sit (especially for 2) I would usually go alone so I'd find somewhere along the window with a stool but even that was sometimes difficult."}
{"text":"Favourite place in Markham to get breakfast. Customer service is always great and the food is really good"}
{"text":"My experience at Alchemy Coffee was very good. I read a lot of reviews about this restaurant and so I was very excited to try their food!! Especially the Chicken and Waffles! 

Once we got there, parking was not too bad and we found a spot in a minute or two. The set up of seating yourself then ordering is quite unorganized and could be improved. We had to wait beside a table of people who were still eating and just had to wait till they were done (which was pretty awkward haha) This aspect of the experience was why I did not give a 5 star.

After sitting down, I ordered and got the Chicken and Waffles and my boyfriend got the Salmon Eggs Benny. Both dishes came out and looked so good! There was a fly on my boyfriends salad and the worker immediately asked us if we wanted a new one. He gave us a new salad and we began to eat. The sauce for the Chicken and Waffles was SO good and I usually don't like salmon but after trying the Salmon Eggs Benny, I fell in love!! 

Overall, the food was amazing and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Its packed majority of the time and the seating is pretty bad. Not a place I would pick to chill with friends. The food makes up for the poor seating, especially those egg bennies, mouth watering and flavourful. The beverages in general feel washed out, matcha tastes more milky than matcha-ful, coffee is bland, but I can see why. Overall, its a great place to drop by for a quick brunch."}
{"text":"Good egg benny, with liquid egg. Waffle is so so. The Matcha soy latte is nice. Worth to go"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to grab brunch with friends or get my fried chicken fix. I love everything on their menu, especially the fried chicken waffle and egg Benedict (with anything), and any drinks. All in all, I'm a big fan and would definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience to visit this restaurant. The food is so so, but it's not worth to wait 30 mins for it. The system of restaurant is totally wrong, there's a messy lineup that stuff doesn't care about who come first. They also can't remember customers order, and refuse to take a note of where the customer seat. Anyway, I won't come back and won't advise my friends to come here."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! from the couple of times I have been here, I have always had a pleasant experience. I wish it was a little bit bigger so that the wait times didn't have to be so long. the baristas are always friendly, and the food is excellent. I usually get the smoked salmon eggs benny, but the chicken and waffles are super good as well! The drinks are also amazing. it's better to come on a weekday so that you don't have to wait too long to be seated, or you can always takeout which would be a lot faster!! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good coffee way better than overrated Starbucks 
Food is ok
Long wait times for sitting down"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today, been meaning to try this place for a long time.   Unfortunately they close early (but i get it, not a dinner spot), wish it was though.

The food at this place is phenomenal.   I had a pork belly omelette, the wife had chicken and waffles.   Their flavours are unique and on point.   I looked over at other tables, going to have to go back for eggs benedict as well.

The place is a bit small, hope they get a bigger location, the number of customers they get on a weekday during the daytime tells me they are quite popular and would have bo trouble filling the space.

Will definately be going back."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch! Quite small so groups larger than 4 will probably have trouble finding seating."}
{"text":"The shrimp omelete was awesome. The food decor is so cute. I like the place but there was a long line to be seated."}
{"text":"Good coffee , worth to give a try 
If u like spacious coffee shop , it is not for a big group. 

Their breakfasts are great and freshly made. I would highly recommend this place for coffee lovers and for small group brunch"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in Markham. Small place but fast service. They serve Pilot coffee which is one of my favorites. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Cute brunch and coffee spot in markham. Food is served until 3pm i believe. Decent food overall with good appeal. Price point is average brunch spot ranging 11-15 a plate approx. have been here a few times and will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

It's a restaurant where you placed an order and pay first at the cashier and then the dishes and drinks will come to your table.

Pros - In uptown, besides Red Bulb, this would be the other place I would come for coffee/Latte/Mocha that are in certain level of quality. Also, they have hot dishes that's good for brunch! So a brunch and a nice cup of coffee, it's the best combination I want for brunch and this place has both that are in decent quality.

I went there several and I tried the Egg Benny and the regular breakfast. The dish cost more than the kind of dish you would get from those HK style restaurant but it's not the same quality you are getting. This place is alot better from my point of view. Just take a look at the pictures posted by other reviewer and you will see. So I am ok for this price range. I cannot remember exactly the price but it's like $12 to $15 dollars per main dish.

Cons - limited dish. I guess it's a good thing in a way so the kitchen can focus and control the consistent quality. But hope they will change the menu in the near future as I started to get tire of the dish. :)  Another point I want to make, if you ever pick the breakfast dish where you select sausage (it's the pork sausage) as the side, just a note, based on the two times I tried, it's not cook in the way I expected it to. It tasted like the sausage is first poached ahead of time and then quickly placed on the grill or hot pan for some grilled marks. So it doesn't have the pan fried taste/aroma that I normally expect from the pork sausage. And its only luke warm when it is served to me. But thats  probably the only not so positive things I can mentioned.

One more thing, the place can get crowded at times so good luck.. :)  I once arrived around Sunday 10:30am and they are almost full. And by noon, there are line ups...

Dont know why, the dishes served in this restaurant reminds me of PaPa George, dont ask me why.. lol ..."}
{"text":"Finally, brunch has found its way to Markham! Coming here on a weekend you should be prepared for lineups. Alchemy works on a first come first serve system where you seat yourself once a table opens up and order up at the front. I probably had to wait about 15-20 minutes to be seated. 

I would definitely recommend the chicken and waffles because the chicken was extremely moist and tender with a good crunch on the batter. I also order a smoked salmon benedict which had a nice balance of flavours and the home fries were nice and crisp! 

If you plan to visit be sure to come early to grab a parking spot and avoid the lines."}
{"text":"I'm happy a new brunch place opened in Markham since it seems that we don't have that many other than the HK style cafes. It is a small but cozy place, a good place to work or study (free wifi). 

I ordered a cup of coffee and the peameal bacon benedict. The peameal bacon benedict had avocados, spinach and cheddar. The benedict was good, creamy hollandaise sauce, and perfectly poached eggs. Their benedict comes with their fries and lightly dressed salad. For $15, I would have to say the portion was quite small but I don't have a big appetite so it was a good serving size for me.
I'm not a coffee expert so I can't comment on it but they use Pilot Coffee.

My friend ordered the Buttermilk Pancakes ($11). It was fluffy and good, topped with cereal and mixed berries. 
I also ordered their Classic Brekkie ($8) to go, which was decent, nothing special about it. 

Downside I would say is that the portion is quite small for the price being paid and not ideal for those who have big appetite. 
The staff was friendly and was opened to suggestions for improvements.
This isn't the place to go if you have a big appetite but it's a place to go if you're looking for a study/working spot or grab some coffee with a friend."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick breakfast on a Sunday morning. The food was good and very filling. Had the chicken and waffles and a benny. The only con was the chicken lacked a little taste. Otherwise it was good. 

We felt welcome even with a baby in tow but it's a small place so I wouldn't want to come here with the baby later on in the day when the place gets busy."}
{"text":"The smoked salmon sandwiched between the beautifully poached egg and portobello mushroom and English muffin was so delicate and tasted so good. The portobello mushroom actually didn't complement very well with the smoked salmon, but on its own, tasted great. The poached egg was very well done and the yolk that oozed out from the egg was appetizing. I really liked the house fries too. They weren't too dry at all and very soft and slightly seasoned. The salad was a good touch to the brunch but didn't contain much dressing as far as I could tell. This was a really great Eggs Benny meal (the only tiny thing was that I found the poached eggs to be on the cold side; did they leave it on the counter to wait for both orders to be served together?)

I tried a bite of my friend's peameal bacon, avocado, spinach, and cheddar Eggs Benny and absolutely loved how the flavours of each ingredient married together very well!  I have to say that the peameal bacon option of the Eggs Benny tasted better than the smoked salmon version by far."}
{"text":"Currently one of my favorite brunch spots in Markham. I love their Salmon Eggs Benedict & their potatoes always hit the spot! Lattes are very good as well.  Get here early on the weekends as there is limited seating."}
{"text":"I love small business and was thrilled to see this coffee shop open up in Unionville.  I really want to like it considering it is a 2 minute drive from home.  We came here on a Saturday and was pleasantly happy to see how packed this place was afternoon.  

I love coffee and of course had to order their coffee to see how it was.  I was terribly disappointed that it was sour.  I expected nothing less than a fantastic cup of joe coming from this place.  Other than that, another point to mention was that it was not hot enough but just above warm.  Shamelessly to say that McDonald's coffee tastes far superior :(

Perhaps it was a one off so I would revisit in the near future and give it another chance.  Please don't disappoint and I hope management reads this and takes into consideration this review to improve the coffee. 

On the positive side, staff was very friendly and I appreciate that especially when it comes to a place to enjoy a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Great cozy place for brunch!! It's self-seat so if there's a spot available you don't need to wait for a staff member to seat you. You order everything up front and they will bring your food and drinks to you, which is pretty nice. 
I got the matcha latte and the salmon eggs benny. The latte tasted interesting since I've never had a tea latte before, and I quite liked it. 
The eggs were cooked perfectly in the eggs benny and had a rich, creamy hollandaise sauce! It comes with salad and house fries (more like potato chunks) and they were both very good. I really liked the dressing for the salad! 
Overall, the atmosphere and food were great! Minus one star for the lack of space (I came here during a not so busy time I think, but I would assume it would fill up very quickly during peak hours) but it's nothing to fret about I suppose. Will be back again to try the open face omelettes :)"}
{"text":"Cute and cozy little place. Busy times you will be waiting a short while for a seat yourself table. Overall the salmon benny was pretty good. The pancakes were good very blueberryish if thats a word. Almond cappuccino was not good perhaps it was a bad choice to pick almond milk. The regular brewed coffee was enjoyable. Nice experience, although annoying with people hovering around for your spot when your done eating."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best breakfast/brunch place I've ever been too, although it is quite small and not a lot of parking, it is worth the wait. This restaurant is self seated, so choose where ever you'd like to sit, if you can because it's usually packed. If your going with more than one person, have someone get seats while the other person orders so you won't be left standing and waiting for a place to sit. There are no waiters/waitresses walking around to take orders, all orders are taken up at the front. 

As from the small cozy environment, the food was amazing! Their pancakes were my favourite, so light and fluffy! The omelette was cooked just right and well accompanied with braised pork belly, onions and Swiss chard. As for the \"salad\" that came with it, it was assort greens, not a huge fan but helped balance out the meal. Can't wait to go back and try some more things in their menu!!"}
{"text":"Came here bc of recommendation.. but unfortunately did not live up to the 4* review... it was WAY over hyped.... came on Sunday for brunch, it was a very small and quaint place...it gets busy quickly however, I'm not sure why...   Staff was amazing, but coffee and food were lacklustre..."}
{"text":"Another cute coffee joint uptown - yes! 

I came to this place during the winter holidays and it was quite busy. 
The decor of the place was nice but as most people started already, the seating was limited. If you need a table for 2 it's okay buy anything more will take some time to find a table as it is self seating and there's only 2 tables that can seat 4, 4 tables that seat 2, and about 8-10 bar stools against the wall. It's also likely that you end up sharing a table with other customers. 
Onto the food:
We ordered cappuccinos which were quite good but not the best we've ever had. Their drink menu was very intriguing and I am definitely down for trying some of their other beverages. 
They also had a good amount of breakfast/brunch items on their menu in my opinion. I was able to try a few different dishes. First was the smoked salmon benny.. Yum. No complaints. Their potatoes look very appealing to the eyes but I personally found them having a sweet note to them and I was really hopping they would be savoury. They had a great texture to them though! Next I got to try the peameal  bacon benny and it was okay. We were mostly disappointed by the lack of avocado that was supposed to be in it. There was maybe one chunk which I was lucky to get. The smoked salmon was much better. Lastly, I was able to try their buttermilk pancakes which needless to say, were a good attempt at the infamous Mildred buttermilk pancakes..But much smaller. The down side was they were quite dry and for me personally, the berry compote/sauce was very tarte. Perhaps I'll try it again during berry season.

Overall, this place is a great place to go to for those in the area as some of us will travel downtown for a good brunch joint. This is pretty good for uptown but it does have it's cons. I would definitely pop in here to grab a drink to-go but I don't think I'll line up again for 45 mins just to get a table."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favourite brunch spots in Markham. Located in a tiny plaza  on Hwy 7, this place is fairly small inside. There are only seats available so I can imagine it can get packed pretty quickly when they are busy. 

My friend and I came early (around 8:30am) on a weekend and luckily they were not busy. On another occasion I came at around 10am and the line was out the door. Unlike other brunch spots, you place and pay for your order at cash first. Their entire menu is written on their wall by the entrance. The service is great and the staff are super friendly. 

I order the eggs benny with smoked salmon which was quite delicious! Not to mention that the the plating is beautifully crafted as well. Though the portions are not huge, it was still a satisfying meal overall! It did not feel heavy unlike other brunch places I have been to before. 

Highly recommend if you're looking for a brunch spot up in Markham. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I got the Eggs Benedict and pancakes because I was hungry... both were delish!!! It's a cute atmosphere and everything else on the menu looked bomb."}
{"text":"If I didn't read the reviews here, I wouldn't have known that you need to seat yoursel first, order at the front and water is self-serve.

Luckily, I knew exactly what to do when we arrived lol. I was craving fried chicken and a lot of people here seemed to love it and so that's what my bf and I both ordered - the chicken and waffles. I also ordered a matcha tea latte. 

We sat by the window because the very few tables that were there were full. So be sure to come early if you want an actual table, although sitting by the window ain't too bad either because you get good lighting for your Instagram pics ;).

Our food arrived in a timely manner, and I noticed they gave us 3 pieces of drumsticks. The meat it self was juicy and tender and the skin was crispy! The waffles were good too but I do recommend you eat that asap because it's not as tasty when it cools down. The matcha tea latte was just ok, nothing special. 

Overall, really satisfied with our brunch that day and will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We went there to have brunch on Saturday. Menu is on the wall. Cordaro is really really good and coffee is good too, worth 5 stars. My husband ordered the classic breakfast. He said they tasted OK. He gave 3 star for it.  I liked these small potatos:) I ordered Shrimp Omelette. It came with salad, which is good. It's my first time to try Omelette. A little bit different from what I thought Omelette should look like...3 stars for the Omelette."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Very random trip in the morning but wanted to try it since I pass by everyday on my way to work and on my way home. Ordered the Latte, salted chocolate chip cookie, croissant and the classic Brekki. Great good, friendly staff ... nothing to complain about. Food a bit on the pricy side but what do you expect for a Caucasian style breakfast. Food was good but I probably only come back for coffee and tea. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Had shrimp omelet and chicken waffle. Really love the waffle. Waffle is crispy outside and soft inside. It's amazing to eat with fried chicken and sauce. 
Will go again to try Benedict egg. Looks delicious on other tables."}
{"text":"Cozy little cafe. Passed by at around 12 and it was crazy packed, came back at 2ish and it still took 10 min for a table. Its a very small place but once it's less packed, a good place to chat. I had the chicken and waffles and matcha latte. Both were very good!

Matcha latte: 5/5 I had it with soy and it still tasted creamy and had a good matcha flavour. It was not too sweet which I really liked, hate when drinks are unnecessarily sweet.

Chicken and waffles: 4.5/5 so good! The chicken was very crispy and not overly greasy, matched the waffles very well. I'm used to having maple syrup with chicken and waffles but they offered a spicy and sweet sauce that was not overly sweet and it really complemented everything well. The only complaint is that the salad was a bit bland.

Overall, super solid cafe with unique food. I wish they can expand so they can accommodate more people at once."}
{"text":"Cool little coffee shop near main street unionville.  The place is hipster city and it's perfect that way!  Great chalk menu with the wifi conveniently on there!  Wait times are worth it if there is a line up, and it does open up pretty fast even on a brunch weekend.  We had the eggs bennys with smoked salmon and the other with bacon.  Both are great and well worth trying.  The Green tea matcha latte is also very well done! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Since its opening 4 months ago, I cannot believe the amount of rep this Markham indie coffee shop has gained for itself. With 130+ reviews already, I feel mine won't make much of a difference. I finally had the chance to visit, and I am here to reinforce the fact that it's SOLID!

For my first visit, I came here early morning 8:30am, they had just opened. I had time to spare, so I sat down and ordered for myself Eggs Benny and a cup of coffee. Food was well-presented, the eggs were beautiful. The caffeine in this java is RELIABLE!!

The coffee is served black. There is a self-serve bar where you tailor the drink to your liking. I like the fact that they offer cane sugar. Less calories and definitely a smoother mix. 

Slowly, more customers began walking in for their morning coffee. To my surprise, 99% of them seemed to be regulars because the moment they walked in, the server and customer both greeted each other intimately (including a police officer!). I heard them having genuine conversations, then they would briskly be on their way \"See ya on Friday!\" as if their schedules are fixed. It's comforting to hear this type of conversation, because it shows there is a community being built here and it's amazing to see.

Space is not an issue in the early morning. I spent a good hour here on my laptop, hearing friendly conversations, just a very cheerful way to spend the morning. I will definitely come back here, it looks like there is so much more to try, drinks and all!~"}
{"text":"Great brunch place :) would highly recommend their eggs benedict. Only complaint is their pancakes taste a bit doughy, not sure if it's a one off or if that's how they usually make it."}
{"text":"Finally gotten the chance to check this place out. Got to the parking lot and it was packed. Then I opened the door to the place, line ups. Must be good or else people won't line up. So I found an empty table quickly, placed the order for my drink and my buddies literally stepped right in the door. (the line up grew steadily after).

I really like the mocha that I ordered. The flavour isn't overpowering and I like the coffee beans they used: it's aromatic and yet not over pungent. My buddies ordered a flat white and apple juice.

As for venue, gotta come early or else no seats. That's my only comment. Aside from that, yes I need to come back to try their food."}
{"text":"I will definitely never visit again. The service is sucks.  The waiter doesn't care about you. I don't think the food is good enough to let me come back again. If there has zero star, I will rate it to zero!!! Bad experience!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a friend. Really cute small brunch place, that was on my list of places to try. We went around 11 and it definitely got packed by 12pm. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my meal! I'm a sucker for brunch and they are a good spot for it. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benny, and my friend ordered the open faced omelette. We also got the green tea latte and a hot chocolate. I think we both thought our food, drinks, and environment were awesome. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've heard a few good things about this coffee place in Markham and decided to try their coffee on a Sunday afternoon. It was packed when I went there and there weren't any spot for us to sit down. So I just ordered one of their coffee to go. I've realized that their coffee beans are from Pilot (located in downtown Toronto). I've tried Pilot's coffee in dt Toronto and a cup of coffee at Alchemy is cheaper than the actual Pilot store in downtown. 

My friend had their latte but I am not a big fan of their latte. I found it too milky and wish that they have a stronger taste of the coffee itself. 

The staff are all very nice and very knowledge about the types of coffee. Will like to come back some day to try their hot food."}
{"text":"First, the parking lot is a little bit of a inconvenience, pretty much half the parking lot is reserved so it depends how lucky you are. You order at the cashier and they bring the food to you. We had the Salmon Eggs Benedict and chicken & waffles. It was SO GOOD! It's also quite filling as well. I also had a London fog and it was really creamy and delicious. Can't really comment on the service since it was quite minimal. Would definitely come again if we can find a parking in less than 10 mins"}
{"text":"Alchemy Coffee is a new cafe/coffee shop that has opened up in a plaza on Hwy 7, near Main St. Unionville. Menu selection consists of breakfast/brunch items, as well as your typical coffee blends (americanos, lattes, etc.). One thing to be aware of; the kitchen is only open till 3pm.

Food: 4.5/5
Ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with Portobello Mushroom and Kale ($14), and the Chicken and Waffles ($15). Both came with a house salad (swiss chard/collard greens with dressing, I believe) and the Eggs Benny came with potato wedges. 

To start, the food was delicious. 
For the Eggs Benedict: the hollandaise was creamy, eggs beautifully poached, dressing on the salad was tasty, and the ingredients were fresh. I can't stress it enough, how fresh the ingredients tasted and what a huge difference it makes. The seasoning was great throughout and the portobellos really came through. The smoked salmon was ordinary, probably store-bought, but gave an overall smoky flavour which was nice. As well, savoury potatoes on the side to balance out the salad.

For the Chicken and Waffles: I was left speechless. The waffles were amazingly soft and warm, pairing well with the chicken. The chicken had the most crispy breading I have ever had. It was seasoned well and the inside was moist. The spicy sauce (tasted like a sweet chili thai sauce) was a decent addition and elevated  the dish to be that much better.

Decor:
It's a pretty small place, and feels kind of cramped. The tables are wooden and nice, giving it the trendy and hipster coffee shop look. The huge chalkboard menu is easy to read and really sells the look of the place. There were people doing schoolwork/studying, however the space really isn't that big or quiet and it didn't feel like the ideal place to set up. Overall, a very casual atmosphere where you can eat brunch with a group of friends.

Is it worth it?
Yes. It is worth experiencing at least once. A lot of people will say the menu is overpriced and I will have to agree with them. The quality of the food is exceptional. It's cooked well, seasoned well, and the freshness can be tasted. However, even after all that, I find that the steep prices are only slightly justified. If you're craving something gourmet and your wallet is feeling prosperous, it definitely won't hurt to try this place."}
{"text":"When your first breakfast in Canada after returning from Asia makes you feel like you never left. That's Markham for ya! Despite the majority Chinese clientele, this place whips up a very Westernized hipster breakfast. Yes, avocado is on the menu. And quinoa, kale, matcha...

And I gotta say, I'm thoroughly impressed! Good brunch places in the burbs are few and far apart. I wouldn't call this the most comfortable brunch experience, given its tiny space and limited seating, but it certainly falls into the category of comfort food. Like a fast food place, you order your food from a board up front. Unlike a fast food place, it is then brought out to where you're sitting. Lemon water is self serve.

And the food. Well. Let's break it down. 

- Pan-Fried Shrimp, Avocado, Roasted Carrots Open Faced Omelette: Divine. I got it without cheddar because I was trying to be \"healthy\", and it still tasted great (though probably better with some cheese). Even the accompanying salad was good. 

- Blueberry Pancakes: Nothing better than surprise pancakes ordered to share by the person footing the bill. These came fluffy, full of blueberries, topped with corn flakes, and with a little bottle of condensed milk to drizzle.

- Smoked Salmon, Portobello, Kale Eggs Benny: Got these on my return trip to Alchemy 3 days after my initial visit and said \"screw trying to be healthy, I'm on vacation\". I'm patting myself on the back for this decision. Everything worked together in a savoury explosion. Then you take a bite of the side of roasted potatoes and just wooooow!

- London Fog: Sweet and milky earl grey heaven. 

Verdict, I want to return. I NEED to return. But unless you go on an off day, I don't imagine this being a very easy place to get into. To me, that defeats the idea of a relaxing weekend brunch. But that smoked salmon eggs benny...maybe I'll fight the crowds just for you. 

NOTE: A friend of my fiancé's left her jacket here and found it again 3 months later. It was just hanging on the rack and no one threw it out or anything. I don't know if this is good service or just really good luck.

{"text":"I think Alchemy Coffee has become one of my goto spots for eggs benny! I tried their classic peameal bacon one as well as their smoked salmon one, and the flavours were well balanced and enjoyable. Every time I've ordered their eggs benny, their eggs have been perfectly poached, giving me the oozing egg that an eggs benedict should have! Their side potatoes are also delicious, and their spring mix salad has a nice sesame dressing that I enjoy. 

Their macchiato has strong espresso flavours while their flat white is light, smooth and creamy. Latte art is just a bonus ;)

I was a bit disappointed with their pancakes, though. When I had it, the pancakes were dense, but the pot de creme was delish. The open face omelette with pork belly was a bit greasy, but the flavours were there nonetheless.

Overall, I would go back on a regular basis, but my wallet will definitely suffer if I do."}
{"text":"My family and I were here on Mother's Day and I was pleasantly surprised. I've past by this restaurants on numerous occassions and always thought it was a coffee shop based on the name. they are open from 8am to 3pm daily. You seat yourself and then order at the counter. They server then brings you the food.  We got there on Sunday morning around 8:15am and there were a few people in the restaurant. It's a very tiny place with 6 tables (2 which can fit 4 ppl) and the rest were bar stools along the wall - probably around 10 in total.  Make sure you come before 9am if you want a seat, otherwise, you have to wait. There is a good selection to choose from and the prices are fairly reasonable for what you get. The portions are good.  My hubby ordered the Eggs Benny with Peameal beacon, cheddar, spinach and avocado spread with house fries and salad for $14.00, I had the Eggs Benny with smoked salmon, portobello mushroom and kale with housefries and salad for$14.00. Both tasted really good but I prefer the Peameal option. My 8 year old son had the Classic Brekke with 2 large eggs, bacon (other option is sausage), house fries and toast with butter. I ordered the Chai Latte and my hubby had the Americano. The latte was just hot enough. I could see the Americano was very hot with lots of steam. Both my kids ordered apple juice which comes in a big mason jar with a handle.  We were all very satisfied at the end. I would recommend this place over your typical Canadian breakfast joints like Sunset Grill and Cora's. The restaurant is clean and the service is pretty quick. It's definitely a good breakfast option in Markham, ON which there isn't a lot of besides the HK style diners."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed Alchemy Coffee before!
I usually come here for their breakfast menu, and I haven't for a while, but this time, I realized that they changed up their menu!

(Food:)
Their PASTA WITH SPINACH PUREE, BEECH MUSHROOM and CHILI was a god-send!  The sauce tasted almost like a pesto and had the perfect amount of olive oil to make the pasta savoury, yet not too oily and heavy.  It also came with a nice over-easy egg.  I wish the portion was a tiny bit bigger though!

(Price:)
PASTA WITH SPINACH PUREE, BEECH MUSHROOM and CHILI: $15

(Service:)
Standard

(Overall:)
Either for breakfast, lunch, brunch or just a coffee, Alchemy is the place to go!"}
{"text":"SERVICE: Alchemy is self-seated, on a first come first serve basis. The restaurant is small, has limited seating, and it doesn't accept reservations so I would advise arriving early to avoid a wait. You order at the front your dish is brought to you once it's ready. The servers are always friendly and the brunch comes out pretty quickly.

FOOD: 
The smoked salmon eggs benny is my favourite! This has to be one of my favourite brunch places with the best eggs benny. The poached egg is cooked perfectly with the right amount of running egg, on an English muffin. It's also served with a kale salad which was fresh adds a nice healthy/light element to the dish. There are also roasted mini potatos which was nicely cooked/crispy and slightly seasoned to add favour. 

I got the matcha latte which had the right amount of sweetness and you can really taste the matcha. The latte art was in a feather shape to elevate the presentation.

The blueberry pancakes are light and fluffy, one of the better ones - delicious!

AMBIENCE: the restaurant is in a small, cozy space with a rustic/industrial vibe with wooden counter tops, concrete walls, and metal stools. Great spot for a perfect Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing eggs bene and good coffee. Only downside is that because it's so hyped right now there's always a line on the weekends."}
{"text":"Decent interior design, with friendly service! I love to see the latte art and the Barrister did great job every time! Food are delicious and well present? Definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Cute place!

First you pick your seat, then order and they'll bring your order right over. 

I ordered the smoked salmon Benny that includes home fries and a salad. 

- The English muffin was soft but lightly toasted. 
- The poached egg was runny yet not too raw tasting
- The salad was pre-dressed with a really nice sesame dressing ( I might be wrong but I think not )
- The home fries were nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection. 

For ketchup freaks like me, it's available on the side table where coffee cup lids are. 

Iced lemon water also available for everyone.

I made it just in time for kitchen closing time, 3:00pm. 

I'll come back to try their coffees soon (wish I didn't already have one an hour before coming). 

There wasn't much service involved, so can't really comment on that."}
{"text":"It's a nice place for breakfast. Waiting for a seat is a little bit awkward, you end up getting confused with whose waiting to order, waiting to be seated and getting take out. I waited in line for 20 mins, while 4 people left before me. Once we placed our order the food came pretty quick but it's what I expected it to be, a smoked salmon eggs benny."}
{"text":"The food is really good. But as with most brunch places, expect to pay $15-20 per person. We've tried the smoke salmon eggs Benedict and the blueberry pancakes. Both were delicious. The pancakes were very fluffy and light, they definitely did a good job on that. However I wish they gave more blueberry sauce as near the end it was dry with no syrup. There was no enough of the sauce for the three pancakes. Also I didn't care for the cornflakes sprinkled on top. Didn't add to my experience. As for the drinks, no complaints. Just like any other coffee place you would find downtown. With the lattes and the cappuccino you would get latte art which made for nice photos. 
It is really small and very tight seating so do expect a line up. The kitchen is only open till 3 I think. Which is disappointing, as they open till 6."}
{"text":"So glad to have a decent brunch place uptown! The pancakes are fluffy and the eggs benny are solid. The coffee also tastes great with beautiful latte art."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: I went on a weekday and loved that there was no lineup. You are supposed to seat yourself when you get in. We just saw the first available stools and table by the wall and got seated there. It is a small restaurant with a few tables of 4's and 2's in the center of the restaurant and the wall and window we're lined with stools and higher seating. You order at the cashier/bar and pay for your meal and then they will serve it to your table. 

Food: very rare you get all day breakfast/brunch item food in Markham. This is not the Chinese breakfast that I'm referring to.... this is the eggs Benny, omelet, chicken and Waffle kind of breakfast. The kind breakfast you normally order from downtown Restaurants on weekends. When I looked at the menu online, I knew I wanted to order the chicken and waffles... But when I saw other people's chicken and waffles order, I didn't like that it is not boneless, so I decided to get the smoked salmon eggs Benny instead. 
Eggs Benny was ok ... The home fries were actually slices of mini potatoes which we really good. The salad served was fresh and the dressing was light. Perfect breakfast combo. I also ordered the matcha green tea since it was so pretty.... Sweet flavor and not as heavy/bitter matcha taste but I still enjoyed it. 

I got to try the chicken and Waffle because my husband ordered it.... But if I had to compare, I like the smash kitchen's chicken and Waffle better. The way the chicken is here, is very tasty on its own.... Because you have to keep in mind that the  drumsticks still have bone... I rather have bite size, small battered chicken to each together in each slice of waffle. 
The waffle is very tasty and crispy on its own as well.... I love that the Waffle is so light in texture and crispy enough ( best eaten when you dip a tiny piece into the citrus dressing). The dressing makes it Delicious. 
But I do not order to eat it together. Seems like the flavors and texture do not go together as well as it should. 

Parking: eeewww hate the parking. Since the restaurant is located in a super tiny strip plaza, parking is limited. Good thing that there were not alot of people at the restaurant that day... Otherwise, we would have a hard time finding spot. 

I may go back again but for now, if I'm craving chicken and Waffle, I rather each at smash, which is pretty much next to it. But if I'm really craving breakfast food, it's nice to have a place to go to in Markham anytime of the week!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast there are really good, made with attention to detail and fresh ingredients. I had similar gourmet breakfast in Montreal before and they were quite expensive. Alchemy's price point for their food and drinks are very reasonable and affordable. Their green tea latte is just as good as Starbucks. My hubby and I really enjoyed our brunch there yesterday. The only thing I didn't like too much about them was the small space and limited seating. If you get there after 10am, be prepared to wait for around 15 to 20 min for your seats."}
{"text":"Despite the limited seating, it was really worth the wait! Got great service and great quality food. This was my second time going, and I'd love to go again! Prices were reasonable, and I love the atmosphere. Although the location is hard to reach due to traffic and a small building, it is still convenient and close to main st Unionville for a nice walk after your meal! I recommend the chicken and waffles, and buttermilk pancakes. I will love to go back to try the popular eggs Benny!"}
{"text":"My first 4 stars. This is how every restaurant food should taste like. The food is really fresh and delicious unlike all the other restaurants I reviewed. The environment is clean and quiet, everything is just very soothing I didn't give a 5 stars because there's room for improvement. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The name, Alchemy Coffee, is very misleading. With such a name, one expects grand transmutations and elixirs that grant immortality. Neither were demonstrated while I visited.

Pragmatics aside, Alchemy Coffee offered a pleasant brunch experience.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, space is a rare commodity in this establishment. Upon arrival, my companion and I scanned the room and there were exactly 2 vacant seats. Perfect!  But not really, because the 2 seats were part of a 4-seater table with 2 other patrons. No worries though, it's the 21st century and Markham is fairly progressive, so surely, these 2 patrons are well-socialized. But nope!  They proceeded to talk colourfully about various lewd topics, but I digress.

We decided to order the Classic Brekkie, Buttermilk Pancakes, a cappuccino, and a coffee.  In my opinion, all of these items were pretty standard except for the Buttermilk Pancakes.  The pancakes were stacked elegantly with a dollop of blueberry paste placed atop and a garnish of cornflakes.  The pancakes were fluffy and sweet; each bite enveloping you in bliss while enveloping your organs in a layer of fat (cemented by the condensed milk served on the side).

The brunch was a bit awkward, to be honest. You have to seat yourself, read the menu on the chalk wall, go up to the counter, order food, and then they bring food to you.  None of this was spelled out, and so most patrons entered with puzzled looks on their faces.  \"Do I seat myself or do I wait for a host?  Do I wait by the counter for my food or will they bring it to me?\"  A simple fix would be to add some signage.

My experience at Alchemy wasn't perfect, but still pleasant.  These types of cafes are rare in Markham, and so I've given them more leeway.  

Suggestions for improvement: 
1) Lease that whole abandoned strip plaza and knock down some walls, increase seating, profit. 
2) Post some signage indicating that patrons should seat themselves.  Better yet, hire a host to seat patrons and provide menus.  They could capitalize on the tips and provide a better service.

Just as alchemists in the ancient medieval and Renaissance periods strived to perfect their chemistry, so too should Alchemy Coffee in their serving of brunch."}
{"text":"???????????????Waffle ???????????????????waffle?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Been a few weeks since we were at there. I really enjoyed my breakfast. 

Had the veggie eggs benny with salad. Loved it. Partner had eggs. Had to pay extra to sub out bacon for avo. And he didn't enjoy his potatoes. Not well done enough. 

Cappuccino was good but felt it was way overpriced for small size. Place is small. If you want to eat in get there early or be prepared to wait. Or get take out. Saw someone do this."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to come here for the first time so we woke up insanely early. 

Definitely recommend the eggs benny and the matcha latte! Although it is on the pricier side, it's definitely worth it. I love their potatoes because it's both crispy and soft. The potatoes are also flavourful with seasoning! Eggs benny with smoked salmon and their salad tastes very scrumptious. 

Things to remember: there's not a lot of seats and parking! So plan accordingly for your visit!"}
{"text":"Great little small brunch coffee sit down place at downtown markham.  It is located in a strip mall across from Infiniti dealership.  

The menu is written on the chalk board on one side of the restaurant, seating is limited there, with two walls of bar seating and some about 6 tables in the middle.  

We went during lunch and it was pretty busy, luckily someone just left from a section of the bar seating, so we went over. 
There's a coat hanger to hang your coat during the wintery months, and you seat yourself, order up for front, but someone brings your food to you. 

There is water at the front that you could fill for yourself if you don't have their coffee or tea.  

I got an eggs Benedict with peameal bacon, spinach and avocado.  The portion sizes are pretty big, with a side of home potatoes and salad. 
It's very refreshing, the salad was lightly dressed and perfect. 
The Eggs Benedict was filled with flavour that married perfect with each other. The egg yolk was nice and runny, avocado adds a nice creaminess. 

Overall a great cozy restaurant to come to, great atmosphere and yummy food!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! However, there is barely any room to sit. They need to move to a bigger location. The worst thing is having a plate of food with no where to sit."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I have been here. The first time I came was when the store just opened,everything was amazing except for the long wait. This time, I ordered the matcha latte and the pancake. The pancake just wasn't as good as the first couple times I have been here, but it's still okay. Staff was friendly as usual. Quite busy for a Wednesday morning - no tables available except a couple seats at the long tables on the side. Took about 5 min to get a parking spot as there was no spot reserved for the customers. Not bad overall."}
{"text":"The decor is so comfy!! However, I went there on a Sunday morning so it was packed with people. I waited for almost 40 mins before getting a 2 people table with an extra chair sticking out the hallway just because we didn't want to wait any longer for a big table. The price is decent considering the amount you'll be getting and the service is great. However, this restaurant is self-serve therefore we had to get our own water and order our food at the front. The food is pretty good, better than your average little breakfast cafe but I would recommend coming here only if you're not in a rush because it can get REALLY busy and the parking lot is super small. Takeout is also an option if you want to eat on the go."}
{"text":"Amazing and super delish. Ate the smoked salmon eggs benny with a salad and potatoes. I have never enjoyed chicken and waffles as much as I did here.

Soy latte was wonderful. Free wifi, great vibe, fast service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch place in Markham. The chicken and waffles are superb and eggs benny was fantastic. Have been to this place multiple times and the food has always been consistent. Would highly recommend... perfect place to bring a date. Would love to see them expand in the GTA as seating and parking can be limited."}
{"text":"Decided to try this little local place after my bro posted pics of their eggs benny. Nice decor with chalkboard menu. We also ordered it and it was delicious!  Eggs were cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were inconsistent as some were crunchy (like an apple = under cooked) while others were fine. It came with a salad too.  In addition, we tried the apple muffin which was alright, a bit on the oily side and heavy so glad we shared. Their flat white was ok too."}
{"text":"Seen many reviews and wanted to see what all the hype was.   This was my fourth time here and finally decided to wait in line and try to eat here.   The previous three times I gave up since there was too many people waiting and parking was tight as well.  There are only 26 seats and the lineup was out the door (10+ people) at 130pm!   You have to lineup at the cash and hope a table becomes available (I definitely did not like the fact the people behind me were asking if I wanted the open table??  What do you think!).   Service was efficient and friendly (once we got a seat).

We got a Eggs Benny (one with bacon and one with salmon) and also a Chicken and Waffle.   The food and coffee were both excellent.  The salad was fresh, English muffin was not burnt, fried chicken was not oily or burnt.  Lastly the eggs were very well done-not too hard and not too runny.   Food was definitely good but nothing to die for.  Over hyped in my opinion. 

Why the three stars when the service and food is excellent?  Cafeteria seating and ambiance (stand in long line at cash), small portions (no one was full), not cheap."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a day off. Despite it being a weekday, the place was virtually packed with only a couple of seats at the bar top seating along the wall. The place seats about 25 people and has a cool coffee shop vibe with shiny black subway tiles and distressed wood finishes.

We ordered the classic brekkie ($8) and the open faced omelette with bacon, corn, tomatoes, and goat cheese ($12). The omelette had a wonderful creamy and fresh taste from the tomatoes and goat cheese. It was served with a simple salad on the side. 

The classic brekkie was a reasonably good deal as it came with 2 slices of buttered toast, bacon, potatoes, and 3 eggs.  Unfortunately by 10:30am, they had run out of sausages and thus bacon was the only meat available with the brekkie but it was pretty fatty even for bacon.

We also ordered their famous matcha latte cookie to go. It was delicious. They are giving away one free small brewed coffee per customer during their grand opening the weekend of August 5-7. A great time to check them out!"}
{"text":"When you go in, it's pretty much the size of a matchbox. I'm really curious how they deal with winter jackets and boots and all that slush. 

I wanted to try here because I was popping by the Unionville Festival (which rocked!!!!) so this was close enough to get there without needing to deal with crowds. However, this place was so small I think it would violate the building code if there were more people than chairs present. Literally no standing room.

I ordered the smoked salmon on portabello mushroom eggs benny with a side of home fries. The Hollandaise sauce was light but with a nice kick. It had a tinge of ... I don't know what it was, alcohol? Anyway it definitely didn't smell like vinegar. Regardless, it was tasty and complimented the egg well. I didn't feel like a hot air balloon after (let's admit it... eggs can make us gassy and gas is a natural human function). 

My human didn't think the smoked salmon and mushroom went well together, but I thought it did. Smoked salmon tends to be dry (which is good), and mushrooms tend to be juicy when you bite into them. I thought they went well together because their moisture level balanced each other out, and it was able to trick my brain into thinking there was a lot of smoked salmon (because it's so chewy and juicy from the mushroom). It's a smart trick. Also, smoked salmon is pricey so I get it. They have stomachs to feed, people to serve, etc. Moreover, the taste of the portabello balanced well with the smoked salmon. Usually mushrooms overwhelm almost everything else in the same dish, but I guess since the smoked salmon was flavourful, it was equal in strength with the mushroom.

This is starting to sound like a StreetFighter Twitch commentary. Which you could totally watch because they have free WiFi and it's strong.

I haven't tried any of their drinks, but peeking over to the table next to me, it seems legitimate. I loved how this spot had so many culturally diverse people. Hipsters, families, seniors, teenagers, and people of different ethnic backgrounds all gather here. 

I'd def like to come back here again."}
{"text":"Best spot in markham for brunch and coffee! If you come during weekends, go earlier as the wait time can be between 30-60 minutes. 

Food: always consistent and everything on the menu tastes amazing; believe me i've tried everything 

Drinks: i always get the cold latte and its always good unlike other coffee shops where taste can differ each time you go 

Price: can be pricey if you want to come here every week 

Atmosphere: definitely a cute little spot for instagram foodies but again come early or during the weekdays! 

Service: always nice and friendly and will bring your food over to your table"}
{"text":"I usually come here before heading off to the airport.  I always get the eggs benny and those never disappoint. It's a great place for breakfast and lunch with excellent staff and services.  Also good for those with peanut allergies."}
{"text":"We had such an enjoyable time here, even though we elected to get our orders taken to go due to time restrictions and wait.

The place is small, but not cramped and when we arrived on a Sunday around 10:00am, it was already a packed full house. I'd say that the place seats at most 40 people, so if dining in is an absolute must for you, definitely arrive before then, as they open at 8:00am.

Husband got the Peameal Bacon Eggs Benny ($13), while I got the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benny ($14). Each comes with house fries and a delicious salad. Both options were delicious in their own way, but I'd say their Peameal Bacon option was a hair better than my Smoked Salmon one. A nice fresh slice of the bacon that wasn't too skimpy in texture and size adorned the English muffin. Perfectly poached eggs adorned the tops of it, and they nailed it to the T.

If it's anything that I have a huge amount of respect for, it's the consistency and execution in poaching eggs. It's not rocket science, but man, getting it just right so that the yolk slightly oozes out is a science.

But I digress.... :)

For the Peameal Bacon version, the addition of avocado and spinach rounded out the texture and flavors of the meal without being heavy. The home fries were a tad under seasoned, but not terribly so. The house salad had a solid variety of mixed greens that were fresh and springy; something enjoyable and refreshing to nosh on during a cool winter morning.

My Smoked Salmon Eggs Benny was very well executed, and the portobello mushrooms really elevated the dish to the next level. Nicely sauteed and well seasoned, the surprise addition of kale was very nice and balanced.

Service was friendly and quick even though we ordered to go. They packed the items carefully and I appreciated the neatness of it all. We also tried their cappuccino which was equally as good and nutty.

Overall, we had wonderful food and look forward to going back next time to dine in. If our to-go orders were this good, I can't imagine how much better dining in would be. Value, freshness, and execution were all excellent.

The location is easy to get to, but parking can be a bit cramped depending on the hour you arrive, so be sure to check around the back of the storefront to find additional spaces. Signage is bright and clear.

So if you're looking for a solid brunch place in Markham, this one is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Came here for Labour day brunch with my boyfriend. We got there just before 1 and the place was packed! There was a line out the door, but we were quickly whisked in (lucked out on being a couple as others with larger parties had to wait). 
This place is hipster haven, but located in the heart of an Asian community 

They have a menu for you, and you go up to the counter to order. 
I got the salmon eggs benny and the boyfriend got chicken and waffles, which were delicious! NB: I may end up writing more about his fluffy waffles and crispy light chicken.

Salmon benny was scrumptious, and most definitely sinful. I really enjoyed their potatoes which were seasoned to perfection :) The eggs are served on a bed of argula, topped with a perfectly poached egg and a generous portion of smoked salmon mmm...who could forget their hollandaise sauce, done just right 

Boyfriend's chicken and waffles had the right amount of batter, but they were small pieces of chicken ): i'd suggest adding a third piece of chicken - especially for the price point.
the waffles are not your run of the mill 'leggo my eggo' type - they're REAL and enormous! made in a waffle maker! home to your syrup pockets! and super scrumptious!

We also had a latte and a flat white, which was the second highlight of our visit to Alchemy. Will be back for their pancakes (maybe when I'm carb loading for a marathon)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite go-to spots for brunch in Markham. I only wish that the place (and parking lot) was bigger because it fills up quickly in the morning. For parking, there's more space to the right of the strip mall on grass and gravel but avoid the mud from rainy days and come early to find a proper spot. 
Note: kitchen closes at 3pm - only drinks (and pastries if there are any left) after 3!

Some stand-outs: this place offers cortados (espresso with an equal-ish amount of warm milk - the milk is denser, not as frothy as in a latte or cappuccino) which I don't find in many cafes, there are three eggs bennies to choose from, chicken & waffles (which I have yet to try!), and pancakes that are topped with mixed berries and cereal. 

Although the place is cozy and small and their menu specializes in a few things, they still have a lot to offer. From a few visits, my friends, fam, and I have tried their:
Cortado ($3.50), pancakes ($11), , eggs benny - roasted vegs ($12), eggs benny - peameal bacon ($14), classic brekkie ($9), brewed coffee - Pilot coffee (S $1.80; M $2; L $2.20), fresh chai latte - iced ($4.75; available hot for $4.25), hot London Fog latte (earl grey tea; $4.25), and a couple of their cookies (oatmeal cranberry and matcha white chocolate chip). 

My favourite item has got to be their eggs benny - my first time at Alchemy, I ordered a cortado and a roasted veggies eggs benny which includes beets, carrots, onions, and brie and is served with house fries and a salad. As a meat-lover, I wasn't sure that I'd be all into an all-veg dish but the combination of vegetables, egg, and hollandaise sauce was more flavourful and rich than I thought would be possible. The side salad is also lightly dressed so the meal didn't feel heavy although the side of yummy potatoes helps fill you up for sure.

Sweet tooth? Alchemy's pancakes are a good pick. Rather than syrup, the sweetness is brought out from the mixed berries combined with the cereal and the milk that you pour over it. This one was a bit hard for me to finish because it's 3-4 stacked pancakes and, towards the end, I was really feeling the sugar but I have no regrets.

More sweet things? Their cookies make a good snack - not chewy (which I prefer) but not too hard and crumbly. Their flavours blend well with that cookie dough taste.

Their drinks are really good here - the cold fresh chai latte gives you a bit of a kick - it's not your typical sugary chai latte. The spice is definitely there. I really like London Fogs so Alchemy's was spot on. Their Pilot brew is also really good. And...if you haven't had a cortado yet, please check it out.  

This place has become a regular for me and if you happen to be in the neighbourhood, definitely stop by - it might become a regular for you too!"}
{"text":"I was around the area for work and found this place through Yelp. I came in on a Wednesday at 8:30am and ordered a coffee and smoked salmon eggs benedict which came with home fries and spring mix salad with vinaigrette dressing. 

I found the portion of the dish to be perfect and the quality of the food to be almost above what I expected after reading a couple of reviews online.

I'd definitely come back for both the food and coffee whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Alchemy Coffee serves up some great brunch in Markham, the only problem was the lack of service. But in the end, good food typically prevails and I really did enjoy this place greatly. 

I'll just talk about the food first. I was initially skeptical about the fried chicken and waffles at first because it didn't seem all that harmonious (the components seemed like separate entities) but the dish still worked out wonderfully. The fried chicken was the main star here; scrumptiously crunchy and crispy crust while being juicy on the inside. The best part? The chicken wasn't oily at all. That chicken skin and crust is to die for, I was still fishing for the morsels of crispy crumbs on my plate! The chicken was also neutral in terms of flavoring; a classical southern fried chicken flavor profile - nothing too overpowering. The waffles were excellent but I definitely did feel that it was on the overdone side; it was a tad hard and somewhat on the burnt side (you can just tell from the colour and the overly toasty taste). The special sauce was slightly tangy, sweet yet had a tinge of a spice; it brought the waffles and chicken together (it reminded me of sweet thai chili sauce). 

The eggs benedict was also excellent. The eggs were perfectly done with just the right amount of runniness and the portabello mushrooms added another dimension to the dish, The homestyle fries were also tasty; perfectly ovened, skin-on potatoes, with a luscious starchy interior. I have to add that I really appreciated the salad on the plates. You can never have too many greens. 

My only minor complaint: Just a heads up this is not a full service restaurant or cafe. It's supposed to be more of a self serve cafe with a counter. That means it was a bit confusing trying to manage a table. We walked in and expected staff to manage the tables but you have to do it yourselves in a somewhat first come, first serve manner. But it may not always work like that. For example, there was a couple of two in front of us and a party of three, and two behind us and a table of four opened up. We initially sat down at the table of four and then a table of two opened up right beside us. We ended up moving to the next table  and exchanging the table with the group behind us. The staff there was trying to fit all 7 of us into two tables. It's not a big deal but it was a lot more complicated than it should be and it was an unpleasant start to the dining experience. But since there was hardly any service there weren't any tips/service charges."}
{"text":"Want to grab a bite before I start my day and so went to Alchemy Coffee, a restaurant that I used to like to visit but haven't been there for a while. Arrived before 9:00 am on a Saturday and it's not as crowded as it usually is on Sunday.

Matcha Tea Latte (score 5/5)
It is warm and is slightly sweet. It has a rich taste of matcha and milk. It tastes delicious and keeps my body warm. 


Eggs Benny - Smoked Salmon (score 5/5)
It comes with green salad and potatoes on the side. The green salad is so refreshing and sweet. The outside of the potato is very crispy and yet the inside is soft. Have no idea how they could cook it this way but it's really yummy !! The eggs are perfectly done. The egg white is soft and the egg york bursts out when I poked it with my fork. There are thin slices of mushroom and slices of smoked salmon between the egg and the bun which added texture and sensation when chewing. 


Matcha Affogato (score 5/5)
Mmmmm!!! It's fantastic!! It has milk at the bottom with vanilla ice cream on top and showered with matcha sauce. It is an excellent dessert after breakfast. This is a new item on the menu and I highly recommended."}
{"text":"Consistent, standard, mediocre, uninspired brunch menu. 

Had chicken and waffles, was mildly insulted by the averageness of flavours, and that it was served with two pieces of value priced chicken drumsticks as opposed to atleast the thighs if not a whole leg. Waffles were just shy of an eggo experience. Served with a generic and modest salad.

 Good coffee, super chill vibe with service at the counter."}
{"text":"Sorry no pics everyone posted the same ones!
What can I say, the place fills up quickly. Open face omelette pork belly my wife says its like Filipino style and was impressed. Had a hot mocha with the breakfast. The side salad matched well.

Great stuff from one dish."}
{"text":"Showed up around 9 AM on a Sunday morning and it wasn't too busy, the service was quick and the food fresh. Their system reminds me of Ikea in some ways, you order the food, pick a table, and clean up after yourselves when done. 

My friend and I ordered the roasted veggie eggs benny and pancakes to share, it was plenty of food for the both of us. 

I thought the veggies could have been roasted longer, and a bit more flavourful, and the salad that it came with was way overdressed. Some other reviews mentioned that the potatoes were undercooked, but I really liked them! The pancakes were super fluffy, but nothing overly special. To be honest, for the prices that we paid, I don't really think the food was worth it. 

They do have amazing coffee though, would definitely recommend the cortado, it is the perfect milk to espresso ratio! 

Cute place to catch up with friends over coffee, I don't know if I would try the food again."}
{"text":"Cute  little place in Markham for brunch very small place but cozy everything is self-serve which is pretty efficient you find a seat order and pay upfront they deliver to you then you clean up for the next guest the food is good had smoke salmon Benny comes with potatoes and the little Green's"}
{"text":"Food is great. Too bad the restaurant doesn't seat comfortably and wait tines are often long."}
{"text":"Love this little place in one of the smaller plazas in Markham.  This place is hard to find, so I recommend using a GPS and slowing down once you are near, because you would never expect to find this place in a plaza like this.

Anyways, the interior of this place is super cute, very modern and coffee shop like which fits the concept.  Of course Alchemy Coffee offers fantastic coffees, they also offer salads, a few small dishes for lunch and some desserts.  Came here twice and tried their iced and hot latte and their salad.

Coffee for sure it's one of the better/premium ones in Markham and I really enjoyed my latte and the latte art!  Great strong espresso flavour! Food wise, my friend's salad looked decent and I tried some too and it is fresh. However, I am still giving this place 4 stars only because of the slightly steep price for food, but if you are here just for a coffee and chat with a friend, this place is a great option if you can find a seat."}
{"text":"The best eggs benny I've ever had. Seriously. Get the bacon benny you won't regret it. 
The venue is small but definitely worth the wait. Get there early!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to find a good cafe for some coffee on a Saturday afternoon. We read good reviews on Yelp and decided to try it out. We are both avid coffee and espresso drinkers but this is NOT comparable to Starbucks nor aroma even though the pricing are the same. It was hugely disappointing based on the good yelp reviews though we did not try their food. The store was busy and all the tables were filled."}
{"text":"Came here from a friend recommendation. Ordered the Smoke Salmon Egg Benedict. Taste good. Very easy to eat. Not too heavy on anything. But the potatoes was a bit raw. Still hard. 
Also ordered Matcha Tea Latte, cold one.. Too much ice, made the drink very watery.
Nice place. Masculine ambiance. Good setting to maximize the space."}
{"text":"Incredible food, and great coffee, all at a very good price. I ordered the eggs benny with pea meal bacon, and it was absolutely phenomenal - the hollandaise sauce was light and fresh; the eggs were cooked perfectly; and the fresh greens with arugula and goat cheese were a perfect addition. My latte was also very well done. My only complaint would be the seating - it is very limited, having only maybe a total of 9 tables at most, and two areas with bar stools. I noticed that many people actually decided not to come in because it was so full (which is too bad for them, since this was a great spot)! 

All in all, though the place is called Alchemy Coffee, I would say that it's the food that really brings it home for this place. The ingredients are always fresh, the portions are hearty, and every dish I saw come out of that kitchen looked simply amazing. Way to go Alchemy!"}
{"text":"I was literally just here over the weekend and when I came back for breakfast five days later, the prices on the menu went up! I also noticed that they include pasta in their menu now too. 

I enjoyed my first visit very much (hence I came back in less than a week) and the food is still delicious. However, I'm giving Alchemy Coffee a lower rating for this visit because of the fresh brewed chai tea that I ordered. 

I expected the tea to be high quality since they use Pilot Coffee. However, my tea came without a tea bag and tasted awful. Chai tea is typically a brewed black tea with spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and cloves. I love chai because of its spiciness but the brewed tea that I had from Alchemy Coffee was anything but spicy. In fact, it tasted like a super watered down version of chai that even I had to remind myself what I ordered because the flavour had no resemblance of a chai tea. 

Needless to say, I will not be ordering that drink again."}
{"text":"Got here at 9:50am on a Thursday and the place was packed. We were fortunate to snag a table for two when I spotted a couple stand to leave; I hovered nearby while perusing the menu on the wall and swooped in the minute they left.

You self seat, order and pay at the cashier and they delivered your food to your table. Talk about multi-tasking: the cashier is also the barista, server and bus boy. Make sure to tip him well for his hard work and skillful coffee art. Ordered my first Matcha Green Tea Latte, it was so pretty! Very milky and creamy, hubby was not fond of it though. Lemon water is self serve.

We ordered the Chicken and Waffles with a side of house fries and the Smoked Salmon Benny. You have to ask for syrup for the waffles because the chicken and waffles comes with a sweet chili sauce. Eat the waffles quick because they cool down really fast and don't taste good cold. The chicken had a crispy Southern spiced breading while the meat was juicy and tender. The house fries were actually potato chunks: tasty, soft but a bit oily. The salad was good but had too much olive oil, salmon benny was ok.

It's a crowded, noisy, busy restaurant. Best for take out in my opinion."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

There was quite a bit of a wait to sit down (self-seating). Also, you go up to the counter to place your order but they do bring it to your table for you. Parking was difficult as many of the spots are reserved for the other local businesses in the plaza.

The food was delicious. Try the pork belly omelette and smoked salmon eggs benedict. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Markham! Such a small cafe, but everything about it is done great! Food, ambiance, and service are all fantastic!

Chicken and waffles was delicious! Flavour wise, it was on point! Unfortunately it came out warm instead of hot, so it took away from the experience. The price was also a bit high ($15).

Great place for a date or just a simple brunch with a friend. Just keep in mind it is very busy, so you might not be able to get a seat!"}
{"text":"It's famously busy here all the time, probably because it is one of a few places in Markham for the kind of food Alchemy Coffee makes. Heck, it kinda feels like this is Unionville's version of Leslieville's (Toronto) popular brunch spot Lady Marmalade.

It's a seat-yourself, order at the front after kind of place. But this is hard to know if it's your first visit and you come in to an overcrowded diner and you see a lineup,and nothing to indicate what's up. Really though, the line is just for folks waiting for a cleared table they can fit their party at. You'd really don't want to spend more time here than you have to. No reservations, ha.

Given the relative chaos, it is amazing the servers can even find you and bring your food to you. But they do. Alongside Pilot coffee beans, the enticing brunch grub options is an awful lot to mull over. I picked the smoked salmon eggs Benedict--not big on eggs Benny but this was a good choice that I enjoyed with its medley of nicely prepared ingredients, the rich salmon and the nicely cooked egg, decent home fries to the side.

On the south side of east Highway 7, the plaza it's in is literally the first driveway you see past the GO railway line as you drive east towards the Unionville area. Parking though is a bit much to desire."}
{"text":"Cozy independent coffee house in an unassuming plaza in a sleepy part of Markham?

Sign me up!

Alchemy is a modern, warm inviting brunch/cafe that opened 2 months ago. They serve strictly breakfast items on the menu and drinks of the caffeinated variety.  While it's table served you have to order it at the counter. There's no waitstaff here.  

I had a classic breakfast comprised of three eggs to order, sausages, small potatoe wedges and buttered toasts. Topped off with a ice brewed coffee.  Delicious and really hits the spot, generous portions too. 

The cafe also definitely has the laptop goer in mind as there were ample availability of outlets along the wall seating.  While the space itself is small, Alchemy has that intimate feel. Great place to meet up with a small group of friends to hang out and chat.  

I enjoyed my time here at Alchemy and look forward to returning to try their other drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Get the Eggs Benedict here - Alchemy remains one of my premier picks for a Sunday brunch but it does tend to be quite packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Markham hands down. Check out my video on Youtube called \"Alchemy Coffee for Brunch\""}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest. I've been here twice now and both times, the service was not great. I even brought my parents the second time just to give it another chance. 

Let's start with walking in. You can tell this place is super small and when I mean small, I mean it can only fit max 24 people. The parking lot is extra small so good luck finding space. 

Then I come up to the till to look at the menu as it's on the left side of the wall when walking in. There's people sitting left and right of you while you're looking at the menu. Quite inconvenient if you want the truth. I had to shimmy when people were trying to get by and order ahead of me. 

Then you get the service....... I finish ordering and he finishes typing it in the system and he tells me that \"it's better if you have a seat and table already. Do you have one??!\" Are you kidding me? You won't serve me because your place is too small and  it's impossible for me to get a seat?! 

Anyway we can talk food now. 

We have tried pork belly omelette and it was great. I had the chicken and waffles and I really liked the spicy syrup. This time we got the pancakes and peameal egg Benny. Not too shabby .

Would I come back: I don't know"}
{"text":"Came here since they serve brunch late. I was disappointed that they were out of eggs Benedict when I wanted to order that. I ended up getting the chicken and waffles instead and still enjoyed it. My friend got the pancakes and she said it was very fluffy and she liked it. 

Overall a decent place for coffee and brunch."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite place for eggs benny! This place is a self seat restaurant but worth the wait (order and pay at the counter first). 

Ordered the peameal bacon, avocado, spinach and cheddar cheese and smoked salmon, portobello mushroom and kale to share with a nice cup of flat white. Each order of eggs benny came with house fries and side salad. The house fries was crispy and side salad wasn't drenched in dressing.  

I would recommend coming here early in the morning on weekends as it gets quite busy! But on weekdays the wait isn't that bad."}
{"text":"This place would be a very average brunch place if it were in Toronto. But because it's in Markham, and our only brunch options are Coras, Milestones and Dim Sum it is always busy on the weekends.

The menu and food are ok...pretty safe, but i would want to see something more exciting than Chicken and Waffles (is this fad over yet?)

The arrangement of the whole restaurant is just weird and awkward. Is it a cafe or is it a restaurant? People get confused, and you can't order food unless you get a table first...so you just hover until people leave. Service is....mediocre. Not sure, we didn't really get a lot of it. But they have the hipster working behind the counter down pat - just like a typical brunch place DT toronto.

Not worth the hassle in my opinion, but nice to see a bit of variety in Markham....hoping for more places to pop up to disperse the crowds."}
{"text":"Great coffee and brekkie was $8 which was a great deal for 3 eggs, choice of sausage or bacon (bacon always), roasted potatoes and toast.
Very busy in the morning so be prepared."}
{"text":"I visited Alchemy Coffee twice for brunch and loved it! The service and food quality were great but it was really hard to find a parking spot, especially during prime brunch/lunch hours. Most people created their own parking spot at the empty lot on the right of the cafe. There were only 5-6 parking spots that were \"legitimate\", every other spot is reserved for another store at the plaza. This coffee shop is not for large groups!! I'd say 4 people max. It's a boutique-sized shop so it's hard to accommodate for a large group of people.

DRINKS:

* Cappuccino - My boyfriend got the cappuccino, he really liked it until he saw my latte coffee size difference. I guess next time he's sticking with the latte haha. 
* Latte - It's a bigger cup than the cappuccino! I liked it :) Not too bitter and not overly sweet - just the way I like it.

I'd recommend coming here during odd hours or else you'd be expected to wait 30 mins for a seat. Seats are first come first served!

I'd recommend:

* EGGS BENNY - served with house fries and salad (4/5)
(Smoked salmon, portobello mushroom, kale)

Loved this! This is VERY filling - come here for brunch and expect yourself not wanting to eat anything until dinner. The portions are big! It's a good idea to share this with someone (and the other person can order another thing on the menu - try a bit of everything!).

* OPEN FACED OMELETTE - served with house salad (3/5)
(Pan fry shrimp, avocado, cheddar, roasted carrots)

By open faced, it means that the egg isn't covering the ingredients. It looks better for photos haha. The shrimps looked more boiled than pan-fried but it tastes great with the avocados. I'd want to try the braised pork belly next time. This lacked just a tad a bit of flavour."}
{"text":"Finally came for a brunch date with my friend :) Food was amazing but I would give the restaurant itself a 3 star. I would highly recommend this spot for take out!!!

Basically you order at the counter and self seat.. sometimes people walk in to order at the counter and it's \"take out\" but my table was stolen 2 times by people who walked ahead of me and grabbed take out but decided to sit. (as in with their take out box and baggies). I would suggest staff monitor this and set a time limit.

Well luckily I got a spot along the bench with my friend and we ordered our food. She got the pancakes which looked pretty amazing! I got the eggs benny with pea-meal bacon, spinach and avocado spread. The accompanying salad and potatoes were great! I loved the avocado spread with the bacon and spinach. My only complaint was that my two eggs were over cooked. The yolk wasn't hard, but it wasn't runny either so I didn't get that satisfying poached egg cut. 

Everything else was great though :) I don't know that I would really visit again though. Maybe just for take out!"}
{"text":"In search of a top notch brunch go-to in york region and based on many Yelp reviewed, decided to make the trek to Alchemy (Fri Aug 10 @10:30am). 

Parking situation: there's very limited parking in the plaza and not a lot of additional parking options. 

Seating -  limited to a few four and two seater tables with a one seater bar along the wall. Not suitable for groups of 8-10+. Also if you have small children (under 3yrs) I didn't see any available high chairs and strollers will be a challenge to maneuver. So it's an eat and dash or take out kind of place. We came mid morning and the only available seating was the bar table. 

Service - orders were taken promptly at the front and we waited for about 5 minutes for our food to be served. 

The main attraction - I had the smoked salmon, mushrooms and kale benny which came with a small house salad (mix greens) and house fries (potato chunks). It was decent and priced well for the burbs but the hollandaise sauce was... sweet!? I've had my share of benny's but this sauce just didn't hit the spot (good thing I asked for it on the side). My sister had the chicken and waffles which were tasty and portioned right for brunch. Their waffles had a touch of sweetness and the chicken legs had a nice crunchy and savoury coating which went well with the thai sauce. 

Overall impression - the food is decent and priced right given it's in the burbs but you can't compare the quality of food to downtown brunch eateries. I'd go again if Im looking for a local fix but id probably take-out and enjoy the meal at toogood pond."}
{"text":"This unassuming place located in a strip mall on Highway 7 in Markham served up the best brunch I've had in a very long time.

Although there isn't a ton of seating and you can hear the conversations of others around you, the food and coffee definitely made up for that.  

I chose to have the eggs benny with roasted veggies served with house fries and mixed greens.  I decided to skip the hollandaise sauce so really my meal was poached eggs on a bed of roasted beets, carrots, grilled onions and Brie on top of a English muffin.  The house fries were delicious and the vinaigrette on the salad was tangy and fresh.

The cafe latte was made perfectly and had some latte art-extra points there! 

If you're ever in Markham, this place is a must-try.  Just get there early to avoid disappointment in not getting a seat!"}
{"text":"One of my faviourit place es for breakfast the place is unique and fancy. I really like how they donot have menu but they write it on wall. They water is self serve and you donot get much service but the workers are so nice and friendly. The place is well organized fancy and clean although it's small. The food was great it has special taste like the home fried potatoes and tiny potatoes and for the eggs they were good and sausages tasted good as well. My friend got the egg Benedict which was good as well. They coffee is strong so it has much caffeine in it. Will definetly come back here and will recoment friends to check the place as well."}
{"text":"Solid brunch. I got the Eggs Benedict which was perfectly cooked. My only complaint is that there were only a few home fries on the plate. The wait is worth it, dont go in starving on a weekend."}
{"text":"Love the food , aesthetics and atmosphere BUT this place is too busy and crowded especially on a weekend . Wish they expanded a bit to fill in more space for customers and comfort . 
Overall I enjoyed the latte and food for brunch . 
I recommend this place if you are looking for that Instagram photo or are in the area . Tip ! Come earlier to ensure you get a seat !"}
{"text":"This is a self serve restaurant canteen style. Arrived around 2pm and a couple of small tables opened up. Got lucky.  Fascinating as it was a snowstorm day yet they were full house on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered the eggs Benny with salmon dish and a buttermilk pancake dish. Both were very delicious. The eggs benny's yolk gushed out as the knife went thru, very appealing to watch. The buttermilk was perfect when adding a little touch of condensed milk.  All in all a very yummy lunch."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5 (half self service - a bit awkward when I first arrived and didn't know what to do)
Environment: 4/5
Value: 3/5

Cute brunch spot! A friend recommended this place and I was not disappointed. We arrived at 1pm on a Monday and we found a seat right away. It is sort of a self-serve restaurant as you seat yourself and order at the counter. We ordered the open face shrimp omelette and eggs benny - both were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Markham coffee lovers, rejoice! A new addition to the neighborhood serving up Pilot coffee, baked goods and brunch. I like the interior, friendly manager/barista and of course the coffee. 

I had a cappuccino and a brewed coffee. Great, although it wasn't as strong as I expected. Butter scone was good too; could consider adding more baked goods selection or offering to serve warm.

Smoked Salmon Eggs Benny - really like the combination of salmon, portebello and kale. Could be served warmer. Potatoes were delicious!

Classic Brekkie - over easy eggs were a little over cooked and can be improved presentation wise with less burnt marks for a cleaner, whiter appearance 

I'm happy to have a coffee & brunch option in Markham. I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"The HYPE is not real. Iunno about all these 4 and 5s but this place is not the go to destination for brunch. Could it be? Definitely! As long as they up their game and up the quality of their brunch. 

First off the coffee was perfect. With slight sour finish that reminds me of Kenyan coffee from my childhood lmao. You see they have good coffee. They know how to brew a cup or two. But that is only half a restaurant ergo half the stars.

The food was mediocre. I get that you run out of supplies on your soft opening. But it's important to at least change the chalkboard menu so customers don't get heart broken when there is no chicken and waffles. According to my girlfriend it's all my fault now so thanks. But honestly it's not hard to erase two words.

The eggs Benedict was meh. Came out luke warm. The eggs were slightly overlooked and the salmon was so poverty osap would give them money. The salad was not bad although it was pretty standard. The menu has about 11 items it's important to do do all these items well. Not a bad place for brunch, but you could find better ."}
{"text":"The food was decent but not amazing and there is very little room for seating.  It's also a little bit on the expensive side for cafe/breakfast food.  Although the servers and cooks are nice, they can get overwhelmed causing the service to be slow."}
{"text":"This place is great. Friendly staff, great food and delicious sounding menu. 

Opted for the Eggs Benny. Served with Avocado, I was a bit hesitant at first but the combination worked very well. The home fries were absolutely amazing. The only thing I could suggest is that the provide a bit more holland size sauce for the eggs. 

They had a great selection of beverages. I was feeling under the weather so I ordered the earl grey tea. I asked if they had honey and they did to my surprise. The only other thing that I was a bit critical is that their ketchup was served in those plastic packages. I would recommend that they serve them in ramekins which would be more in line with the restaurants quality. 

All in all though - 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE
This tiny, self-serve style cafe seats approximately 25 people at a time. Patrons line up at the door to find a seat before they can order at the counter. Parking is super limited - there's probably 8 spots in the lot that's not reserved; after that, you're parking on gravel. 

SERVICE
Not much service to speak of really - you seat yourself, pay at the counter, and they'll clear your table and bring over your food. When we asked a staff member to clear the table after a couple left, he was polite and returned quickly. 

FOOD
We ordered a braised pork belly open-faced omelette and the peameal bacon eggs benny. Braised pork belly was super tender and seasoned well, but we found that there's something inherently too heavy about eating it for brunch. The portion is smaller than expected and I note most of their meals do not come with toast like other brunch joints. 

The eggs benny was instantly a favorite. From the fresh avocado spread to the salty cheddar and the perfectly poached egg, we enjoyed the dish immensely. I would definitely come back and try other eggs benny dishes they have. The salad and potatoes on the side are done well. I liked the Asian style dressing which refreshed the palette after the pork belly and bacon. 

The coffee was good but nothing remarkable. No complaints here.

QUALITY/VALUE
The two plates and two coffees we ordered put us back just over $30. It's more expensive that brunch places in the area considering the smaller portions and minimal service.

OVERALL
Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Sunday morning. Be prepared to wait a bit because there are only a few tables and they only let you order after you've secured one. The décor is pretty hip and the full menu is on the wall. Ordered the chicken and waffles and a iced brew coffee. My girlfriend got the smoked salmon, Portobello and kale Eggs Benny.

The drinks come out quick in cute Mason jars. For the iced coffee you put the sugar and milk yourself. The food came shortly afterwards. The fried chicken was nice and crispy with a light well seasoned batter and it comes with a sweet and a little spicy sauce that goes well with the waffle.

I will definitely return some time to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and vibe! Almost couldn't finish the eggs benny because it was too fatty, but the flavour was good (fatty because the salad had an oil dressing, the potatoes were cover in oil, and etc. but the portions were good!)"}
{"text":"Loved the food and ambiance of this place. Parking was a bit difficult because there are reserved signs for other stores. However; the restaurant and the food looked very aesthetically pleasing. Also they had great service !! 

Personal Notes:  I recommend coming here for take out or with 1-2 friends. Not enough table seating to seat there with a large group of people."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 eggs benny (salmon), the chicken & waffles, and the salmon salad/green bowl plus two apple juices. The bill was around $60. Pros: Great hours- we went on a Monday morning at 9am! Food wasn't disappointing: eggs benny was delicious, home fries perfectly seasoned and some bits crispy just the way I like them. The waffles were some of the best in town & quinoa bowl with salmon was crispy & light . The only con would be parking and the small space inside, so its not great for larger groups."}
{"text":"Good place and the barista make excellent drinks. This place is a bit small and the parking lot is quite small, other than that, I think this place is good for lil chat or small lunch/breakfast break"}
{"text":"Split review.

Regular coffee - Very good and well priced.  $1.85 for a small coffee that was served in a ceramic mug.  5 stars for the coffee.

Salad (lunch) - Fresh ingredients.  Alright portion.  I liked that the dressing was well mixed in, not just poured onto the salad.  Quite pricey as it was more expensive than the salads at Panera Bread, which I considered of similar freshness and standard.  4 stars for quality, 2 stars for prices.

Come for a coffee and maybe a breakfast or sweet.  Save your lunch for somewhere else."}
{"text":"For uptown this is a good casual brunch option. Might be a bit confusing for someone coming for the first time. You seat yourself and order at the counter then wait for your order at your table. Not a place to meant to hangout. Food is good but menu really has not changed since it opened. I usually get the smoked salmon benny which is good, comes with potatoes and a salad. Also like the pork belly omelette."}
{"text":"First timer at Alcheny Coffee and it won't be my last! Took another beautiful girl out to this breakfast spot for brunch. A late start to the day but a good start to the day! We ordered the chicken and waffles and the eggs benny with bacon.

 Both the chicken and the waffle were amazingly soft on their own! So much flavour and such a perfect combo like us. Big portion, 3 pieces of chicken and 4 clouds of waffles. The eggs benny was tasty and cooked perfectly. Came with a side of potatoes and a salad and I was full by the end. We settled this all down with a ice coffee that was cohesively bringing the meal together. 

However, the spot is pretty small and not many seating options as it could only fit 30 people. Also parking is very limited in this plaza."}
{"text":"Love this tiny coffee shop! I've visited many times just for their coffee and a few times for brunch. Their menu is fairly small, but absolutely delicious. Most of the time I just visit for coffee. After having their coffee it's hard to go back to Starbucks."}
{"text":"This place is the best brunch spot in Markham. Really giving the downtown cafe vibes! Both the eggs benny that we got was absolutely delicious and the coffee did not disappoint as well. The downside about this cafe is the amount of space! It is on the smaller side so when it gets busy, there is a wait.. but trust me, it's worth."}
{"text":"Definitely in love now. The only place I can think of where I am totally comfortable eating brunch alone.

Got the buttermilk pancakes after seeing great reviews. Has blueberries on top, icing sugar and cereal. Instead of maple syrup they give you condensed milk - a unique touch! I liked it and it was creative. Definitely on the sweeter side though it balances well with the blueberry. Pancakes were super soft, light and fluffy. A big portion so you might want to share! I would not get it again since I'm not a pancake person - too starchy and sugary for me by the end. But if you like pancakes the go for it! 

Also had the peaches and tea latte for something different. Sweet, milky tasting with a bit of fruit. Good. Still like the London fogs better. 

$17. Still pricey but I stayed and worked there for a few hours. Went in at 12:30 today (monday) and the place was pretty much full. I was lucky to grab a seat. Continued to be mostly full until around 2 or 2:30 with people moving in and out and no one had to wait."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff/owners. 

It's the 'soft opening' so tweaks are likely being worked out. 

We have been here a few times for brunch and coffee. 

The regular was extremely good. We found the espresso to be a bit too bitter. 

We enjoy the classic Brekkie. Whomever scrambles those eggs consistently does it perfectly each and every time. 

The space is nice; it fills up fast on weekend mornings. Ample parking available."}
{"text":"Very quaint cafe. Great food and Great Service! 
Good for pick up and go. and if you want to stay and eat you may have to consider timing as it can get pretty busy."}
{"text":"believe the hype!  i'm not usually in markham, so the one time that i was, i definitely had to check this place out.  small brunch joint with wooden and dark decor providing some warmth.  avoid peak hours!

i'm not even an eggs benedict kinda guy but the peameal bacon benny was loaded with layers of flavour and texture.  perfectly-cooked egg, smoky savoury tender-enough peameal bacon, some strong chive thing going on, a couple of arugula leaves (because health... right?), all atop a well-buttered english muffin.  the potatoes were great too - nicely seasoned and crisp on the outside.  to cap it all off, i'm a big pilot coffee fanboy, and they serve just that!

i'm absolutely sold on the quality of the food here.  i would easily come back to try their other brunch items"}
{"text":"I came here upon recommendation . The fried chicken was good but a little to oily. I enjoyed the matcha latte though and the prices are decent. The place is pretty small and can be hard to find a seat. I will try some of the dessert next vist and see how that goes"}
{"text":"Super busy brunch place in Unionville but I'm lovin' it! Markham needs more indie coffee shops! And this one is actually good! Loved my latte, loved my muffin, loved the vibe. Did not like how crowded it was though but thats what you get when you found a good  spot!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday around 1:30-2pm. I got the smoked salmon eggs benny and the matcha latte. Total came up to about 22 dollars. You basically order and then find a seat- the place is tiny so it can be pretty difficult. The eggs benny is served on an English muffin with house fries and salad. I enjoyed it and the meal was quite fulling. The matcha latte was disappointing, the quality is lacking which results in a powdery drink. It's also not very fragrant, so the taste was weak. It is worth a visit though to get your brunch fix."}
{"text":"So since Kris U has reviewed this place in July, as he has predicted, this is \"THE cool spot to be\" now in Markham.  Literally, all the cool kids of York Region are out there on Sunday late-morning/afternoon and parking is becoming quite challenging.  

The bf and I love a good brunch on Sunday mornings and we've gone here two weeks in a row now.  Their coffees are definitely excellent - we've just had their house brews so far and they've been really good.  

We've tried the following as well: 

a) Eggs benny w/ smoked salmon
This one has been our favourite eggs benny on the menu so far.  Their poached eggs are always done to perfection with the perfect amount of runny-ness.  It comes with a side of roasted potatoes (delicious) and a nice little salad.  This benny comes with portobello mushrooms and kale, which tones the salmon down a bit but it does still make a great combo.  

b) Eggs benny w/ peameal bacon
This one was...okay.  I personally found there too be too little avocado and worst of all the spinach really just washed out everything else's flavour.  But as usual, the poached egg was done to absolute perfection. 

c) Open faced omelette - pork belly
This dish came with pork belly on top of a skillet that contained an egg w/ swiss chard and onions.  It was really quite delicious but nothing too special.  I would probably try something else next time. 

d) Buttermilk pancakes
OMG. Yes.  These buttermilk pancakes are SO fluffy and delicious.  Best of all, they put a bit of corn flakes in there to give you that extra crunch.  Their berry compote was really well made as well and best of the best...they give you CONDENSED milk to to put on your pancakes.  AHhh....super delicious.  

e) Fried chicken & waffles
OMG. Do get this.  The waffles are phenomenal...you know those Asian eggies?  Yeah...literally that same batter is used to make their waffles (or it tastes like it at least).  I was in heaven.  And their fried chicken is phenomenal too with that sauce.  

Overall, like all the cool kids of Markham, we love this place.  I would definitely come back to continue to try more of their stuff.  In terms of seating, this place is quite small and you do need to wait until tables free up.   And finally, remember to go up there to order your food first!  You order and pay first - very much like a coffee shop.

**Useful & considerate tip**: So there are a lot of people who wait for a spot on weekend.  Coming here on almost a weekly basis, I see the window seater folks for whatever reason hogging up the tables for a really long time (as in, I come in and start waiting and they already have food there) and I'm done eating and they're STILL sitting there.  I know you want to get together with your girlfriends and boyfriends and chat it up, but maybe finish your brunch and coffee shop hop elsewhere because that's just mean to not let anyone have your seat for hours on end.**"}
{"text":"Wandered in from the pouring rain for brunch in this cozy space. Waited about five minutes for a table at noon which is quite good at noon.

Food is ordered and paid for and then brought to the table. I tapped my card and it rang through without asking for tip. I let the cashier know and she said tipping was whatever. I asked for change and added a normal tip to the tip jar. Not sure that was the right answer, but it felt okay to me.

I'd give it a solid 3.5. Would be a 4-4.5 if the food had been hot.

The mixed berry pancakes were fluffy and yummy. The chicken and waffles were 6.5/10, waffles were barely room temperature. A side of home fries was delicious and I'm not normally a fan.

The coffee was good, fresh and hot. The cappuccino was tiny and perfect."}
{"text":"My first visit but will not be last!!!  I had the best fried chicken I ever had!  Juicy and crispy!   The dipping sauce for the waffle is good but it's a bit too sweet for chicken and salad!  
Causal dining with no server!  Still recommend to have one person clean the table and control the line at the front!  It will help a lot!  
Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite go to spot for brunch! I absolutely love the smoked salmon eggs benny from there! The sides (potatoes and house salad) perfectly compliment the eggs benny!"}
{"text":"This place is a 3.5 and a weird one for me. I get mixed feeling when I go here. I really like their food but don't like how the restaurant is arranged. I think it's also overpriced for what it's worth and find the service average. That said, the food is tasty and I'll go again (hence the 3.5/5 and not 3/5, however I don't know they make it to a solid 4/5 in my eyes).

I've had their smoked salmon eggs benny twice now and it's a very yummy dish. It comes with two eggs, potatoes and salad. It's simple and well put together. However, I think it's a bit overpriced. I ordered this and a cappuccino and it comes up to $20+. 

Seating is self served and it's basically like a fast food place (pay up front and grab a seat). I think this model works in a restaurant that isn't packed but given their limited space there is usually a line up and it becomes a bit of a free for all. You'll have people waiting for your table standing right up beside you waiting for you leave. The first time I went I didn't know the model and had a group that came after me to take the next available table. It's just not an enjoyable eating overall, even if the food is good.

Either way, I'll probably be back since there aren't that many solid brunches places in Markham and I'd recommend trying if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must try brunch place! Although it's a small restaurant, it's cozy, brightly lit from the wide window and carries a rustic feel. It's more of a self-serve place where you would order at the counter, and they'll bring the food to your table. The brunch items are pretty on point and photo-worthy. 

I ordered the buttermilk pancakes ($11) topped with mixed berries, cornflakes and a condensed milk syrup. The pancakes were so fluffy, and it was great pairing with the crunchy cornflakes. We also got the opened face omelette, the braised pork belly ($15) and it came with a generous portion of house salad. Food is delicious and I can't get enough! 

I found the seating situation kind of odd - it's more of a first come first serve with no one to take down your name. It could get a bit chaotic, especially on weekends, since there are so many people waiting and you wouldn't know who was first. So the wait time is often unknown... 

All in all, would I come again? Yes, still a lot of menu items to try!"}
{"text":"I had the green tea latte and the green tea cookie. Right when I came in it was already packed so I know this place has to be good. The green tea latte is good but I think starbucks is abteer latte but good effort. Definetly a unique place as well they have really good breakfast items like chicken and waffles. Overall not bad  and they do make a good cup of coffee"}
{"text":"Alchemy coffee has some of the best coffee available in Markham. Staffed with cheery bright eyed folks ready to serve. 

Unfortunately their seating is somewhat limited. As well as a first come first serve establishment creates an environment where new customers will kill around your table. Understandably not their fault.

Will return at less prime hours. Great coffee"}
{"text":"I was so shook when I found this place. The food is incredible and the coffee is amazing. Ordered the braised pork belly omelette and the smoked salmon eggs benedict. They were perfectly cooked and tasted delicious. Definitely will be coming back here :)"}
{"text":"How to describe my experience with Alchemy. It is a wonderful addition to brunch places in Markham. The food is very good! I had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon, my brother an omelette, and they accommodated my sister in law's dietary restrictions. All were yummy!!  But ... the size of the establishment poses a problem. Is it a coffee shop or a restaurant? It is certainly too small to be both. I had tried coming here three other times (even week days), but every table was taken mainly by coffee drinkers, and once even by a student who had covered a table of four with books and papers. This wouldn't be a problem in other brunch places that serve coffee, or coffee places that serve brunch; unfortunately Alchemy does not have the space. I live close by and can afford to drop by to see if they are busy, but would not drive more than 10 minutes to stand and wait for their food with other good brunch places around. Also, when they are busy the food can take a while to come out, which again does not help their cause. I think better management is needed.
In any case, if you can get past the space issues, it is a great place to have brunch at."}
{"text":"They don't have a lot of selections but all the dishes I tried were superb. I especially love their egg benny and chicken & waffle. The price is reasonable and the portion is good too. The staffs are nice. As for the drinks, I only tried their latte and brewed coffee. The latte was soso but the coffee is very good and this is coming from a person that doesn't like coffee that much in general. The only drawback is that this place is very small so you might have to wait a while if you go during their peak time. It is extremely difficult to find a parking spot. The small plaza only has like 20 parking spots and most of them are reserved by other stores. However, I'd say it is worth the wait. This place is definite a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Celebrate the addition of another excellent coffee house in york region (markham/ stouffville) area.  Excellent muffins and I especially love the coffees (ice brewed and specialty) and the breakfast items.  Muffin was chewy, moist and not too crumbly.  Iced brewed coffee was strong with hints of floral notes but no bitter icky taste at all.  The cortados are excellent hot or cold outside.  It has a great balance even if made with lactose free and soy milk.  Breakfast, hmm, where to begin?  The egg benedict is one of the best ever even beating most downtown toronto places.  The pancakes, super delicious, fluffy and it comes in 3 with blueberry compote.  That would have been sufficient without the sweetened condensed milk and corn flakes which i found it to be a bit much.  

Wish the hours are not so short and coffees a bit bigger but I would definitely keep going back"}
{"text":"Alchemy Coffee is an adorable little cafe. It doesn't seat too many, but myself and a friend were able to find seat near the window. It's a cozy little establishment. You order the food at the counter and one of the two servers brings you your order. 

My friend and I originally wanted to come here for brunch, but the prices were a tad bit high. So we opted for coffee and a small snack. Absolutely loved the matcha latte and the white chocolate chip matcha cookie c: The coffee cup was huge and the cookie was delicious. Surprisingly, the prices for the coffee and cookie were reasonable.

Definitely coming here again for coffee!"}
{"text":"After being so used to accessible brunch places in Downtown, it was nice to find a place uptown for brunch too! I've always heard good things about Alchemy and I wasn't disappointed. I came on a Sunday morning and as expected, the place was bustling! The concept is cool with the order up front and then have food brought to you. My friend and I tried the smoked salmon benny and the blueberry pancakes! Everything was well proportioned and tasty! I also found staff helpful and food came quickly which was also a plus. Probably will become my go-to brunch recommendation from now on!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places in Toronto. The omelette and waffles are so good. However it's hard to find a table so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Great coffee, spotless and cute. Tasty eggs benedict  with an usual sauce, not classic hollandaise (nice twist with a touch of chilli powder). Potatoes were perfectly crispy on outside and soft like butter on inside."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my friend to celebrate her birthday. It was quite busy on a Saturday morning so we had to wait for a table (thank goodness it didn't take long). 

Here's the process for newcomers:
1) Secure a table
2) Order at the front
3) Wait for your meal to come to you!

I got the smoked salmon eggs Benny ($14 - portobello mushrooms, kale) and it's served with house fries and salad. The serving was very generous, I almost couldn't finish the second half of the egg Benny. The house fries was really good! The salad was very fresh and wasn't dry at all (I find most side salad tasteless and dry).

I had a hot fresh chai latte ($4.25). I'm a fan of chai but not this one. It was too herbal smelling to my liking and there wasn't enough kick to it. Also, there was some grit maybe from the \"freshness\" of the latte.

Lastly, I got one of the two last matcha white chocolate cookie ($2.25)! I had that later on in the day and it was good but probably better if I microwaved it. The matcha taste didn't really come through because the white chocolate overpowered it.

I really like this cute little restaurant. I feel like there isn't many good brunch places uptown. This is a nice addition to the Markham food scene."}
{"text":"Been here twice now but forgot to post a review the first time, so I will do it now. While I'm sitting and waiting for my lunch, I'm munching on their matcha and white chocolate chip cookie. I've read about this cookie in various reviews, but was unable to get one the last time I was here. Let me just say that it is delicious!! I'm not a big fan of matcha, but I definitely am enjoying this cookie because the matcha is not too strong and the white chocolate chips add just the right amount of sweetness. As I sit here, I think I'm going to get another one before I leave.

This time around, my husband ordered the smoked salmon eggs benny with portobello mushroom and kale. The first time we came here, he had the open-faced pork belly omelette. According to my husband, both meals were delicious! The pork belly was crisp on the outside and the fatty part still had that jiggly, jelly like consistency that makes pork belly so appealing (to those who can get over the fact that it's just fat). The smoked salmon with the portobello mushroom was a great flavour combination and also a healthier choice this time around (although the Hollandaise sauce makes it less healthy).

As this place is called Alchemy Coffee, you'd expect it to have better than average coffee if it is to live up to its name. According my husband, who really enjoys coffee, they have great coffee! They have a fair assortment of coffees and each one is brewed well, not to strong, not too weak, but rich in flavour. (I'm not a coffee drinker at all, so I'm just paraphrasing what my husband said).

Overall, I do enjoy this place, it's just requires some patience to get there from the west end (because of construction), finding parking (many of the parking spaces are reserved for other businesses in the plaza) and getting a seat (because it is a very small restaurant - seating for about 26 customers). This is definitely a place to try out if you like a cozy atmosphere with brunch like dishes, coffee, and/or matcha flavoured cookies."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with the girlfriend here. We both got the smoked salmon Benny and although that dish is delicious everywhere this place knows what's up. Adding the portobello mushroom to it is a great touch. Could have used just a touch more hollandaise sauce. Also got the flat white, which was great. They use pilot coffee which is one of my favourites."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out on a Monday afternoon thinking it wouldn't be busy but we were absolutely wrong. I don't blame this place for being busy, as I know their drinks are wonderful and up to par with their breakfast/foods. Since we couldn't get any seats, we opted for just ordering our drinks to go. I got the iced matcha latte ($4.90) while my boyfriend got a regular hot latte ($3.95) and we were both very pleased with not only the service, but the quality of the drinks. My matcha latte was very creamy and not overly sweet and the latte as well, was creamy and delicious. I also recall both the drinks having only one size but I think the sizes are reasonable (they also do latte art for drinks to go). I gave this place 4/5 stars based solely on the service and the quality of their drinks (since we didn't get to try their foods yet). 

Downsides? Parking is very limited and the place itself is fairly small so seats are also limited. I suggest going there earlier and to keep an eye out for the place since it is small and located on a busy road."}
{"text":"It's a cute cozy place to hang out with a friend over coffee and snacks. Their breakfast is pretty decent too. Haven't been there enough to try more things but so far their tea lattes have been a success."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning to get the peameal bacon eggs benny ($13) and my friend ordered the smoked salmon eggs benny ($14). Both came with house fries and a garden salad. The place was full by 10:30, but we waited approximately 30min for seats. The atmosphere was very nice, with friendly and welcoming servers, and nice presentation, but the food itself was very bland. The hollandaise on both of the eggs were kinda tasteless, as was the rest of the eggs benny, though the smoked salmon gave the meal a saltier taste. The peameal bacon, on the other hand, was underseasoned, and tasted like cardboard. The home fries weren't salted, and was also disappointing. The salad had a nice and light vinaigrette, and was a nice addition to the meal. 
Overall, the meal was disappointing, especially for the long wait. I could likely get better breakfast at a lower price. I don't think I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"The service is nonexistent, it's almost self serve, as long if you're okay with it then the food was okay. The home fries was decent, pricing was a fair for a brunch place. 

Seating is 'if there's an open table get it yourself'.

Edit: free Wi-Fi +1 star"}
{"text":"I was excited at the beginning that Markham has a seemingly chic and vibrant brunch just like one of those in downtown. But what a disappointment! The only thing that was done right for my smoked salmon benny was the soft poached eggs. The hollandaise sauce was so bland and lack of zing that it made the whole breakfast staple unappetizing. I have to say it got the look of a benny but not at all the taste. There's only one time refill for their mediocre brewed coffee. The washroom is spacious and I wonder why they don't even bother to put up a changing table for mommies. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. It's not worth the hype and definitely I won't visit again."}
{"text":"Rating's going off the fact that we didn't know they stop serving food at 3. Still, the guy behind the counter let us order as we literally had 2 mins left till the kitchen closed. Kinda made us feel rushed but ordered nonetheless. Really wanted to try the Eggs Benny but they were out as this is what I usually use to rate a Breakfast joint off of (ratings prolly woulda been different had I got to order it) Got the pork belly omelette instead which was decent. Wish it came with home fries though but you could get it in the side. 
I live in Durham region and prolly won't be making a trip just for this as there's many other choices along the way. Still, I can see why people who live close by come here. It's a cool little spot in Markham you can go to if you're in the area rather than trekking all the way downtown."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I finally tried this place out. A super cute spot with delicious brunch food! Albeit, the place is quite small with very limited seating so don't be surprised if you end up waiting as you watch people eat their delicious meals in front of you. However,  I think it's worth the wait! 

Their menu is simple but it has all brunch fixings you could want. The pemeal bacon eggs benny is classic and thus delicious. I normally don't go for veggie options, but I tried their veggie eggs benny and it was surprisingly good too...very flavourful but if you're not a fan of beets, I would say skip this one because the beets really pack a punch when it comes to flavour. 

Their buttermilk pancakes are definitely a favourite of mine and my boyfriend. Their twist is that it has cereal sprinkled around it and you get what I believe is condensed milk instead of maple syrup (cereal and milk..get it? lol). I definitely recommend trying them out but I wouldn't eat only the pancakes on their own. 

In terms of drinks, I can't say too much. I've tried the matcha latte and similar to other reviews, the matcha flavour is not really there so I'd skip that drink. Their coffee though is not bad but not out of this world either.

This place is definitely one of my favourite brunch places though. If you haven't checked them out yet, what are you waiting for?! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch food and I am huge fan of Pilot coffee so I was super happy to find out that it was their choice of roasters. Tried their classic breakfast and peameal bacon eggs benedict. Both were cooked well and a good portion. In terms of drinks, I would recommend their flat white, cortado, and americano. Their brewed coffee is usually the Heritage blend which I like best as it's aromatic, strong in flavour and doesn't leave a sour aftertaste like some coffee do."}
{"text":"The coffee here sucks.. latte isn't great either...

The dark roast coffee was pretty light.. everytime

The latte was also missing flavour..

As a coffee shop, this place is probably 1.5 stars in my opinion. It's also under staffed - Starbucks and second cup coffee is so much better.. service is a lot quicker too.

But the breakfast is the only reason why I come here.

Had the Eggs Benedict and Peameal Bacon and Eggs.

Eggs Bene were good, nothin really special - 3 stars..

The Peameal Bacon and Eggs is SPECIAL.. better cooked and presented then most other places! Their choice of Bacon and the way it's cooked reminds of Korean BBQ cooked soft.  The scrambled eggs served the skillet is super fluffy and also much better then most places.

Been here 3 or 4 times, in my opinion, the only thing worth coming back for is small brunch date on a weekday.. 

Place is super small and super packed on weekends.. probably won't have a place to sit.

By the way.. brunch for 2 is usually about $40 plus change.. 

All in all, 2.5 stars rounding down to 2."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with the BF on a Saturday and it was packed! We got lucky since we came at a time when a few people were leaving.

I got the buttermilk pancakes while the BF got the pea meal bacon eggs benedict. My pancakes were nice and fluffy and the berry sauce with the condensed milk sauce was delicious! I had a bite of the BF's eggs benny and it was AMAZING. I will have to get one for myself next time!!!

Water is self serve but we decided to get something different to drink instead. The BF got a Chai latte while I got a London fog latte. I noticed that there was an option to substitute milk (+$0.60) so I went for almond milk. Both yummy!

The only reasons I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was that the size of the place is small! I think this cafe will go to places if it was larger to fit the amount the people who came in. I also thought it was quite strange how the BF's food and mine were served at different times even though we ordered them both at the same time. By the time I got my pancakes, he was almost done with his meal!"}
{"text":"It's always conflicting to write a review for a place when I love one aspect of it, but hate another aspect of it. 
I finally visited this often raved, highly rated Alchemy Coffee for a quick brunch and snack. The place is A LOT smaller than I expected. Was ecpecting the size of a regular brunch place, but in real life it's the size of a typical coffee store, jam packed with tables and chairs...and people. People wait to line up inside the store beside where others are eating. It was a pain to even walk from one end to the other without knocking over a plate, or hitting the knees into a table. Huge pet peeve of mine. 
Food on the other hand was amazing. Pork belly omlette and affogato were delicious. Good portions and shortly after ordering."}
{"text":"Really tasty Cortado, cute latte art, great customer service! Would definitely recommend to any coffee lover in this area."}
{"text":"Its a good place to study after the lunch rush. Before that, its a good place to grab late breakfast. 
The coffee though is pretty normal and not out of the world. Per the name, i thought it will be out of the world but the alchemy in the name is a lie. Its just artisan coffee. 
Lots of plugs for you to bring your laptop."}
{"text":"Came by for breakfast the other day and it was a phenomenal experience! Parking was plentiful in their private lot and seating was plentiful, at least when they opened at 8 am! Staff was prompt and friendly!

Started off with a mocha which was excellent! Temperature was perfect, froth was excellent, and most importantly, beverage wasn't too sweet!

Had the smoked salmon eggs benedict for breakfast and it was excellent all around. Smoked salmon had a nice fragrance to it and the breakfast potatoes were made using fresh crispy potatoes. The side salad was fresh and the balsamic vinaigrette wasn't too overpowering. The kale and portebello mushrooms complemented this dish perfectly!

Ambiance was unique too.  Modern and clean!"}
{"text":"Service:
I came on a Sunday around 11:30 and this place filled up quickly. Given that there were limited tables, no \"Please seat yourself\" sign or assistance from staff, customers were left in confusion. We weren't sure if we had to wait to be seated or find our own tables (note: I confirmed with the cashier afterwards and he said it's first come first serve). Interesting.. because while I was there, I saw that same cashier and another staff ask two separate groups to give up their tables, AFTER sitting down, to other groups because 1) another pair had already paid and received their coffee and had no where to sit 2) a group was waiting for this table first. I'm pretty sure both parties were upset to have been asked to give up their tables, especially since there were no clear instructions or help from staff regarding the table seating order. In fact, one party left after. It was disorganized and the staff weren't consistent. 

Food:
I ordered the smoked salmon benny. They should consider giving whole or more portobello mushrooms instead of 4 thinly sliced pieces. It was a huge let down. My friend ordered the braised pork belly omelet and he thought the dish was well-made but not worth its price. Presentation of the dishes were appealing. 

I've tried a handful of good brunches downtown for the same price, better quality and bigger portions. Alchemy Coffee did not live up to the hype or my expectations. It was good but nothing special or unique. 

If I didn't want to go all the way downtown for good brunch, I would consider coming to this uptown location. But be prepared to find parking and a table."}
{"text":"Alchemy popped up on my feed of places to try and it was a great suggestion!

Thoroughly enjoyed my brunch here despite having to wait a bit before getting a seat. This place is self serve in terms of seating. 

I tried the Eggs Benny with the peameal bacon, spinach and avocado spread and it was delicious! The egg was very well and the dish was very satisfying with the accompanying salad and home fries.

I also had their chai tea latte which was nice and foamy and also pretty good. 

The parking in this plaza is also very limited so it can be tough at peak times to dine here."}
{"text":"I had the london fog a couple times- it is good but nothing extraordinary. 

I think the food is overpriced for what you get. The eggs benedict are good and they come with salad and home fries. The salad looks to be pretty much mixed greens from the grocery store packages with some vinegrette. The home fries I had the first time were very very greasy- the second time improved on this aspect- though both times lacked in flavour.  

Nice to have an all day breakfast option in town but could work on making their options more flavourful"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and coffee and it was pretty good! I'd recommend to anybody who wants a nice, delicious brunch in Markham. Not too many places like this yet here that I know of. You come in and you order and then you sit down! Make sure you come early because this place is really small and gets packed pretty quickly.

The coffee tastes pretty average to me, I'm also not an avid coffee drinker. But the food was really good. I had the pork belly open omelette and it was simply amazing. The pork belly was cooked almost perfectly, it was juicy and seasoned perfectly and went well with the egg part of the omelette. I also enjoyed the salad that came with the meal too.

I was able to try the eggs benedict it was not bad, even though I tried it when it already cooled down, but I can see how it would taste really good when it was warm. It was made pretty well. Also the potato home fries are bomb.

Also the service is quite good here, every employee that we talked to was respectful and polite. 

They also don't ask for tip when you pay for the meal or coffee, but expect it after. So it's more of a cafe style than a restaurant style place."}
{"text":"I went here on Wednesday in the early afternoon. Just finished having lunch with my sister at a local ramen place and decided I wanted to check out this establishment since I've heard so much about it. Now keep in mind we did just eat but we were looking for a little caffeine pick me up. 

So when we got there the parking lot was already pretty much packed, which in turn meant the location would be busy (which to me is always a good sign) We walked in and it is VERY SMALL, with that being said we grabbed some seats by the wall on the stools. This was after ordering a flat white and a latte. 

The menu was displayed so lovely and very straight forward. Looking around at the tables you can tell that the food looked delicious!!! Once our caffeine drinks were ready we grabbed them and sat back down. Of course you know we had to be those people that were taking pictures before even touching our drinks =) It was delightful and definitely the pick me up we were looking for. 

I would love to come back and try the food, hopefully I will do that soon."}
{"text":"Came here once on a Sunday afternoon and got the open-faced pork belly omelette. The pork belly was divine and they were quite generous with the number of pieces in the dish. The egg itself was what you'd expect it to be and the caramelized onion was a nice touch. Overall portion size was decent but for someone with a larger appetite I would imagine they would need a little more. 

As many other reviewers mentioned, the self-serve seating appeared to be a bit of a disaster for many. That, coupled with the tight spacing made the dining experience significantly less enjoyable. Parking was also challenging, as many of the spots were reserved for other businesses in the same plaza. 

Overall, the cafe is good for those who don't care much for a comfortable relaxing environment. The staff were great and super helpful but the restaurant's seating strategy should be reassessed."}
{"text":"Cute little spot for dates or to just catch up with some friends. Discovered this brunch spot from a friend and overall enjoyed my experience. The store is smaller compared to regular restaurants, so be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for a spot! 

I ordered the Eggs Benny with smoked salmon and overall was a 4/5. It lost the one star because the english muffin was quite hard for me to cut.

The Iced matcha latte was also 4/5. The taste was just the way I liked it, not too sweet and not too bitter. I would've liked it more if they served it in a mason jar instead of the takeout cup. 

Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot for breakfast or brunch. I had the eggs Benedict which were delicious and served with a side salad of greens and hash browns. Delicious coffee and food!

My friend had an omelette and extra serving of hash browns. She thoroughly enjoyed and I loved how it was served, in a mimi skillet..how cute!

Ingredients are fresh and the menu is small but exactly what you need in a brunch spot. Markham needs more cafes like this!!

My only qualms:

- Tiny and i mean TINY space
- Seating is a joke, ppl just push and run to seats instead of waiting for their turn and servers do nothing
- Parking is non existent for the amount of spots in this tiny space
- Go at off times so you aren't waiting"}
{"text":"My vote for the best breakfast place in Markham.  Very busy. Self seating; and pay at the cashier.  Most of time, you have to wait to get a seat first then order.  Had the open face omelette with pork belly for $15. Would prefer it more if seats were assigned."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a while now. Wow. I couldn't believe that Markham would have a good place that served eggs bennys. I was really thrown off by how plentiful they packed their plates and how delicious their hollandaise sauce was. The salad complemented the saltiness to the dish. It is a little on the pricy side but seriously a great place. Parking is a little difficult and they do run out of certain drinks early on in the day."}
{"text":"This cute and trendy cafe is a nice stop for a morning coffee or brunch. The ambiance is sophisticated and relaxing. They offer a nice variety of caffeinated drinks, including plain coffee, espresso drinks, and tea drinks. There are also some great-looking food items on the menu. I tried one of the eggs Benedict dishes, and it was delicious. Stop by to unwind and just enjoy the morning."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch and good atmosphere. A little pricey but over all great food! Usually a small line up."}
{"text":"Food- 4.5
Atmosphere- 4

Good brunch place in Markham. Arrived at around 11 and the place was jam packed. The restaurant seats around 40 people and it is self-serve. You walk up to the front to pay/order and then seat yourself. Someone will come and bring you your food once it is ready.

Food: Ordered the salmon eggs benny which has kale & portobello mushroom. Came with a side of house salad (tossed lightly in a slightly sweet balsamic vinaigrette) and home fries which were seasoned with salt&herbs. Food was delicious and servings were reasonable.

Drinks: Coffee (pilot brand) is served black - they have a cream/milk/sugar counter on the side where you can mix to your heart's desire. They also have lemon water you can grab by the cash counter. 

Be sure to arrive early if you come as the place gets packed quickly (During the weekend brunch rush there will be people standing by your table watching you eat)!

They offer free Wi-Fi - password: coffee123

Overall it's a good brunch place to go to but I would not bring a large group of friends (4+) here given the lack of seating."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The coffee was very good. We also tried the shrimp omelette and avocado spinach eggs Benny - both were great. 

Seating area seemed small for how crowded it was. Still super comfortable, relaxed atmosphere to grab coffee, breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a delayed review,  although I dont know if this is even a needed review when just about every foodie royalty has given this place every thumb they've got up. 

Location :Place is tiny in a small plaza, having the hubby park = to valet so I dont have anything to say.  The actual dining is a bit crampy. They have tables against the sides though wisely placed made the already small dining even smaller. Making walking around quite a challenge. Dont even get me started on my journey when I had my heavy coat on and had to walk around the diners to hang it on the opposite side of our table. 

Getting Food: You go up to the counter to order (you can leave a tip in the jar). They serve you your food on the table, but once you're done you clean as you go. 

The Food : I like very very much , they serve an assortment of breakfast food that's not just your average pancakes or toast , bacon or ham. They actually serve food where they thought of your palates and  believe it or not your SiGHt rather than just your belly. Case example : fluffly dollar pancakes piled on top of each other drizzled with a Mixed Berry compote with sweet buttermilk on the side . Now comes the troubled question every diet conscious ,calorie counting person contemplate: To Put or Not To Put (thebuttermilk). Now my very wise answer : Hell YES! 

If you do decide answering No to the question , may I suggest you take the route I took (my son ordered the pancakes I just salivated on his side and of course took a bite or 2 and 3) . I ordered the Smoked Salmon, Portobello Mushroom & Kale Eggs Benedict. The sight already starts filling you prior to devouring it. And yes the eating part is just as fulfilling as the seeing part . The arugula salad on the side and home fries were all given the same attention to detail that I wont be surprise you turn over a clean plate. 

The hubby on the other hand thinks this place is just ok. But then may be I should order him something other than toast and sausage. 
I will definitely be back here to get him chicken and waffles with me on his side of course ;-D"}
{"text":"Came this morning with my husband. We were lucky enough find a seat immediately because a lovely couple was willing to share their table with us. Based on personal experience and hearing from others, this place is packed 24/7 (seriously, I tried coming on a Monday once and left because I didn't want to wait). So, today was our first time. 

Everything was fine, just not amazing by any means. We each had different eggs benny (smoke salmon & peameal bacon). We each also had a latte: chai & matcha. I've had better drinks elsewhere, but they tasted okay. The food quality is pretty similar to Milestones brunch menu. 

For Markham, this place would be considered unique, but not compared to the rest of the GTA. Due to the wait times and crowded environment, I wouldn't come back here by choice. Husband felt the same way."}
{"text":"Stopped by for coffee on my morning commute. Wasn't expecting much but was very pleasantly surprised their brew is very smooth and aromatic. Service was present and quick. I'm so happy :)"}
{"text":"Quite impressed with this little place in Markham. Love the feel of it. Went monday for lunch. They still serve brekky! Got the classic for $8, good portion ! Coffee was good, had a latte $4. My friend had the salmon benedict and she enjoyed it. I'm interested in trying it myself next time, hence only 4 stars since classic eggs and sausage are a pretty standard fare. 

Definitely gotta go again."}
{"text":"Popped in here to get a latte given the new-ness and hype.  A cozy little cafe with all wood decor and nice light background music.   The latte (and latte art!) were great and better than a Starbucks any day.  

Will come back to try the food as the blackboard menu does sound pretty interesting."}
{"text":"You bet I was here for blueberry pancakes. 

What can I say except they were really good! Big and fluffy and topped with oozy blueberry sauce.

Hate to measure them to Mildred's Temple Kitchen but Mildred's 5/5 blueberry pancakes had me on a witch hunt to find the same thing but closer to home. Alchemy is just down the street from everyone in Markham. Convenient!

Only call out is that I found them slightly too starchy, blueberry sauce though yummy was very sour. It was all a dream until the very last bites that I had to muster up strength to swallow.

I will 100% be back to try the pork belly omelette! Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Once again, I have found another good coffee shop in Markham. Its so exciting to find shops that work with espresso other than the big chains, especially when those shops are close to home! As an added bonus, you can sit down in Alchemy for some brunch as well. I will have to do that next time, but for today I purchased some coffee and one of their cookies. 

We ordered and iced coffee and a flat white. No complaints about the iced coffee. The flat white however was a tad too milky on the palate. Perhaps this can be combatted with more bean in the portafilter or even a stronger bean. On the plus side, the milk was perfectly steamed for a flat white. It was velvety smooth and void of any large bubbles. Also, there was latte art! Visual appeal adds to the overall product quality, so this is important! 

Iced coffee was fairly priced at $2.75. As for the flat white, I would say its a bit pricey at $3.80. Its not like the flat white uses a huge portion of milk or coffee, so I never quite understood the prices of downtown Toronto coffee. I dont expect the same prices here. Enlighten me? 

Oh and the Matcha cookie!! That was really tasty so thumbs up for serving those up, Alchemy. It had a noticeable matcha flavour and had rich chunks of white chocolate if I am not mistaken. 
---
FOOD FOOD FOOD

I got to try the food today...I must say, the classic brekki is a damn bargain at $8.00. I decided to add bacon with all that money I saved hahaha. All in all, $10.00 for a good sized breakfast- Ill take it!

The eggs benedict were also excellent. Hollandaise tasted great and the english muffin was perfect and had that slight chewiness that makes it so good! (Atleast in my opinion). Comes with a small salad and homefries aka pieces of potato. 

Great stuff all around, alchemy :)"}
{"text":"Came on a saturday afternoon and it was very crowded. Parking lot is small. But got lucky and found a spot pretty quick. Heres my adventure at this cozy little place. We went straight in and was confused with the sitting, do I just sit down or do i wait at the door? Lol then i notice the sign that says just seat yourself and purchase at the front. Got that figured lol 

So i was waiting for a table and reading the menu figuring out what to get, and this girl overheard me telling my frd i want pancakes and waffles. She was like \"No, dont get the pancakes, theyre reli stiff. The waffles have no flavour to it. The chicken is good tho\" LOL uhmmm. I kinda came for these but for her to mention it to me like that, i gave up on the thought to be adventurous as I was starving at that point lol

Ended up getting the pork belly omelette, smoke salmon benny, and a matcha affogato. Overall every thing tasted really good but nothing to die for. The braised pork belly tasted way better than i expected!! The muffin for the benny was a bit dry and i wish it was toasted/warmed. The portions are relatively small tho i think or i was just really hungry lol"}
{"text":"I am back!  I wasn't kidding when I said I would be back soon to try more items.  Brought my sister and my niece here today.  I thought that coming on a Friday morning would be quieter but it was just as busy as Saturday morning and by 10am the place was completely full.  They really should have a new process of getting one of their staff to assist with customers waiting for a table which would really improve the atmosphere to be more relaxing.

I gave it 4 stars last time but based on today's visit,  I'll have to lower it slightly to 3.5 stars.  Similar to last time, we ordered only 2 items to share between the 3 of us.  We got the Buttermilk pancakes and Chicken & waffles.  Let's start with the pancakes, it was well presented but taste wise, it was only okay.  The berry jam smothered on top of the pancake was a bit too sour and so the 1st piece was left uneaten.  The Chicken & waffles were good but nothing too special.  The lattes were still outstanding.  The Eggs benny smoke salmon was so good last time, it will be very hard to choose something else next time as the items today were a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"I am so glad a new brunch place open in Markham. 

Service: very friendly and you can see they are passionate in customer and in their work. 

Food: we only sample the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. It is on point. 

Drinks: they use Pilot Coffee Roasters Blend. I quite enjoy the Cortado. Since they are still soft opening, they are adjusting the taste. Hope they can work on the crema. It is still a better espresso drink in Markham. 

I am sure will come back to try their brunch items and home baked goods."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
Near a high-traffic area on Highway 7 and Main Street Unionville. Parking spots were limited during weekend brunch. Try to get there a little earlier to beat the lunch rush! 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Staff at the counter were fantastic. This is more of a self-serve style café because you order, pay at the counter, and grab your own seat.

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
Cozy, clean, and lots of natural lighting for great pictures of the food! 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 5/5
Fresh & high-quality ingredients. Everything was well-paired with one another, and presentation is impeccable

[ORDER]
Eggs Benny served with House Fries, Salad & Roasted Veggies (Beets, Carrots, Onions, and Brie) - $14.00: eggs were cooked just right with a beautiful runny yolk. House fries were crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. Salad was fresh and paired well with the tangy dressing. Seasoning brought out natural flavours of roasted vegetables.

[OVERALL] - 5/5
I would definitely recommend this café for brunch. Prices are a little high, but definitely worth it for the food quality and intricate flavours."}
{"text":"Came here on a tuesday morning at the suggestion of a friend. There was just enough parking and seating for us in the location. This would be a cute place to hang out if you're in a pair, and probably not so much in a large group (I think the largest tables are 2 tables of 4). 

Ordered a matcha latte and the smoked salmon eggs benedict. The matcha latte was very good - very smooth, perfect sweetness, and I'm always a fan of latte art. It was a good pick-me-up to the crappy week I've been having. The eggs benedict at $15 was okay. It came with a small salad and roasted potatoes which were a bit underseasoned. The actual eggs were delicious though - they were cooked perfectly and burst open with a beautifully runny yolk. 

Because I was able to find a seat and enjoy a nice brunch and drink with a friend, it was an excellent visit. I can imagine feeling a bit annoyed if it were full and we were unable to sit though. Anyway, I would chance returning for another one of those delicious matcha lattes though. Will be back."}
{"text":"It's nice that a new brunch/coffee shop opened in Markham, but...

Their menu is quite limited (for now anyways since they're relatively new), and the place itself is not that big. Having said, it would get pretty loud and busy if a bunch of people shows up for brunch here; they'll either be waiting outside or opting for another restaurant in the area.

Location is quite convenient, and there is plenty of parking available. You might not find this place the first time since they're in a somewhat ignored plaza on Hwy 7. There's not too many chairs or tables, but they do have lots of natural lighting which is nice. This place is not ideal for groups, but more for a coffee date or something. 

Their price is a bit steep, especially compared to other independent coffee shops... the drinks are okay but didn't really justify what they're charging. 

Staff are friendly and welcoming which is always nice; service was quite efficient too. All in all, I would probably visit again... but definitely not a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"The salmon eggs benny is amazing! My go to every single time. The matcha lattes (cold and hot) are also amazing. 

The cold matcha latte comes in a mason jar, and the hot latte has an awesome latte art on top. 

Definitely recommend this place for breakfast/brunch any day. However, it gets extremely busy. It's best to go early in the morning or a weekday."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience coming here except for getting a table! This place is pretty popular and the tables are a first come first serve basis, so you have to be pretty patient. 

I ordered the Eggs benny smoked salmon ($14) which came with a side of potatoes and salad. I also ordered the matcha tea latte cold ($4.75). I thought the food was good but not amazing. It's a simple salad, the small potatoes are cut in halves. My boyfriend also ordered the chicken and waffles, the chicken was nicely seasoned.

The service is friendly and they are pretty quick with serving the food. Besides the wait, I would consider coming back here."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try out Alchemy. My friend and I came here on a rainy Wednesday afternoon and it was PACKED. We had to wait about 15 minutes before finding a seat but I am glad we waited because their smoked salmon benny was delicious! 

At other restaurants, I usually regret ordering smoked salmon over peameal bacon because I always find that the smoked salmon is not fresh or a little too overpowering, leaving me with a fishy, oily taste in my mouth. But Alchemy's version gives a great balance of all the ingredients (smoked salmon, mushroom, kale, the runny yolk, and the hollandaise sauce) ultimately providing a savoury and delicious brunch. I was so satisfied!

I also HAD to order their matcha latte, which was beautifully made and insta-ready. However, I think I prefer the one from Starbucks more because I found Alchemy's lacking in some matcha flavour.

Nonetheless, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There is not much parking in this plaza . You may have to park in a dirt area . The place is really small , you most likely have to wait. The restaurant doesn't manage the lines - honour system . The coffee was weak -was not happy. The benny was okay- nothing spectacular. Not worth it for the wait and the small seating."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch places thus far! The atmosphere of this place is great! Very homey and modern. The menu has a great selection from chicken and waffles to eggs benny. Food is fantastic, my go to is the chicken and waffles. Waffles are made to perfection and the chicken is not too oily. The side salad is a great addition along with the spicy Thai dressing. 

Always try to get to this place early! Unfortunately seating is limited, so there might be a line. Once there's a free table, grab it and order! Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.

Eggs Benny ($14)
Eggs benedict with smoked salmon and portobello mushrooms on an english muffin. Dish comes with a side salad lightly dressed which I liked, and home fries which were more like roasted potatoes to me. Loved the fact they were portobello mushrooms as they are more tasty than typical mushrooms. Price is average considering the ingredients included (most restaurants charge more for smoked salmon and portobello mushrooms). You can totally tell their poached eggs were made from some egg cooker machine since the eggs' shape look exactly the same on every dish. It's good that is consistent, but shows not much effort into the cooking and that it wasn't exactly hand made. Regardless the dish was tasty, exactly what I asked for but nothing outstandingly special.

Chicken and Waffles ($15)
The dish comes with a side salad lightly dressed which I like. The portion was actually quite generous - I was expecting only 2 pieces of chicken but they served 3. The fried chicken was really good - super crispy, perfect for those who love fried batter. The waffle was not fluffy enough, slightly soggy. But the combo together was nice and tasty. The syrup really added a nice flavorful touch to the dish. Again, the dish was tasty, exactly what I asked for but nothing outstandingly special.

One thing I couldn't wrap my head around was the coffee sizing. My boyfriend ordered 8oz cup of brewed coffee and I had the iced coffee which came in 16oz. My boyfriend couldn't finish his entire coffee so he poured probably a bit less than half of his coffee into my cup, and it completely filled my cup (my cup was half empty). So, it means either they gave my boyfriend a free upgrade on size, or my iced coffee was completely undersized.

Overall I think the food here is good. I would come again because I like the atmosphere, the staff are nice, and the food is decent for it's price. I actually think their brunch is better than Smash Kitchen (last time I went there I was really disappointed)."}
{"text":"Service was bad, they wiped the table beside us, but not ours. So we did it ourselves, which is fine. But then a lot of people who ordered after us were served before us, and this is cause of the kitchen's inability to multi-task orders, because they cooked all the same meals at the same time. So when Chicken and waffles came out, a few orders came out at the same time. 5 orders of Eggs Benny out at the same time, etc...

The food wasn't bad, but not sure it was worth the price. Better deals to be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try this place. Although there's limited seats and the place is quite small, it was a warm and inviting environment. When you walk in you have to secure your seats first, and then go up to the counter and order. The staff will bring your food and drinks to your table. If you get coffee it's served black so if you want milk or sugar for your coffee or other condiments, it's on the side. You can also self serve and get lemon water there. 

The place was full when we arrived for brunch but luckily there were two seats by the window. The food was great! Got the smoked salmon eggs benny and it was one of the best I've ever tried. The portobello mushroom gives it a nice kick.  The chicken and waffles was also good, chicken was juicy but the waffles could've been better. Definitely will return here for brunch."}
{"text":"The food here and atmosphere is very cute and nice. However their prices are kind of up there for the portions.  Lunch with a drink came to around $19. Hard to find a seat as it's self serve but it's cute nonetheless."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday afternoon with my brother to have some brunch. We were lucky and got there right before there was a rush of people and got a seat. My brother and I tried the following:

1. smoked salmon eggs benedict which included portobello mushrooms and kale with a side salad and roasted potatoes ($14) - the smoked salmon was good and the eggs were poached perfectly with just the right amount of sauce. However, I was disappointed with the amount of kale that was in it. They were finely chopped and most fell out as I was eating it so I barely even tasted it. The mushrooms were a good portion and complimented it very well. The salad was your average greens and so were the roasted potatoes. It was a good portion for a brunch meal.

2. chicken and waffles with side salad ($15) - I've had chicken and waffles before and this was a pleasant surprise. The chicken was fried for sure but it wasn't overly fried to the point that you thought you were at KFC. The menu says spicy sauce but the sauce was more like a sweet chilli Thai, which actually made it a lot tastier with the waffles. This was also a good portion for brunch.

3. Iced matcha tea latte with soy milk (they also have other non-dairy substitutes) ($4.75+0.60 for soy) - I was pretty upset with this one. Not much matcha flavour and way too much soy milk in it. For future reference, at least for their lattes, they do add vanilla into it so if you're watching your sugar intake, be sure to ask for it unsweetened.

4. matcha white chocolate chip cookie ($2.25) - you can taste the matcha flavour and the white chocolate goes well with it. Again, if you've read my reviews before, you know how high I hold my expectations for matcha are. I was hoping for a bittersweet cookie with a bitter matcha and sweet white chocolate but it was a typically sweet matcha and white chocolate chips. Still good, but not the matcha I was hoping for. 

All in all, will definitely come back for the food and maybe try a different coffee drink. The servers were really friendly and answered all my questions!"}
{"text":"The staff here was really sweet. Food came out super quick. It's well lit and there's lots of seating. Definitely get the pancakes. They were phenomenal and the perfect portion."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast restaurant and one of my friends recommended me to try this one. I went on a Saturday morning and the place was packed. As you walk into the restaurant, the menu was on the left hand side in big font. What was great was that they had a relatively decent number of items on the menu which I preferred. I didn't have to look at many choices before making my decision. 

I ordered a matcha latte and the peameal bacon eggs Benedict. The latte had a good amount of green tea flavour, but it wasn't too strong which I liked. The Peameal Bacon eggs Benedict meal came with a salad (which was not overly dressed) and roast potatoes. My favourite part of the eggs Benedict was the hollandaise sauce. It was nice and creamy and you could taste the butter :) The price for the eggs Benedict meal was $14 which was decent and not too expensive.

Overall, I would definitely come back to this breakfast hotspot, but maybe not a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"4 star for service and 1 star for food.

I was here on Canada day, arrived at 9:10am when it opened at 9am. Oh man this place is already packed!! I thought it must be a good sign??

Ordered eggs Benedict with peameal bacon and a coffee.

Coffee was ok I am not even sure if there is refill (most brunch place offers free refill).

So the eggs Benedict arrived, the look is quite good but then I found out the egg was not poached.. It's cooked by some sort of metal or silicon mold!! I think just because of that it's a big thumb down.

Hollandaise sauce was .. Nothing to talk about. Peameal bacon was so small piece. This plate did not deserve to be charged $13.

I have eaten a lot of eggs Benedict and it's definitely one of the worst."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday morning for a quick coffee, but upon seeing the delicious menu posted up on the huge chalkboard, I had to change my plans. Completely torn between some top choices, like the smoked salmon eggs benny, the braised pork belly on open faced omelette, pancakes.....some solid brunch choices!

The setup is a \"seat yourself\" style, and pay for your food at the counter. Works well with the hipster vibe. I got there around 10:30am, and joined the line-up that went out the door. Happily chatting with my friend in line, it passed by quickly. Pro Tip - run up and order a coffee first, and drink while you wait! We ordered at the front, and seated ourselves on the counters by the corner.

I picked the Braised Pork Belly open faced omelette and was not the least bit disappointed. Paired with my coffee, it was the perfect brunch amount! Lots of flavour, but won't kill you with the sodium. Had a bite of my girlfriend's benny and was also impressed.

Overall a great little uptown brunch spot, especially for those who don't want to make the trek all the way down to Liberty Village scene. Parking was a bit of a mess, being a small plaza...Subway next door also appropriated a good number of spots, so beware of that. There's also the option of parking on the residential street behind the restaurant, and walking over."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already, this place has the best  breakfast meals I highly recommend any of the Eggs Benny and their ice coffee is really good. 
Good place to grab a coffee with your partner (wifey or hubby) thou their seating space is a little small. Saturday and Sunday mornings are usually busy so you may have to wait for a seat, but I will tell you it's worth waiting to get a seat."}
{"text":"Their latte is quite pricey, but quite good. The brunch options look average, I would prefer to go elsewhere. They offer several green tea pastries or viennoiseries, which are quite attractive. It is a quiet coffee house but it can get busy for brunch."}
{"text":"Who knew this little joint in Markham pumped out solid brunches. Tried the eggs Benny and the chicken and waffles. Both were great.  This place is quaint and gets busy weekends be prepared."}
{"text":"I got the pork belly omelet (because I love eating pork belly), and a vanilla steam. I thought the pork belly was good, just that the pork belly had favour, but the egg at the bottom was missing some favour. The vanilla steam was good though.
The people there are very welcoming and nice, they also provide free wifi.
The only downside would be that the area is kind of small so if there is a busy day, you might have a hard time looking for a spot to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Ummmm wow. This place left me at a loss for words. Usually small coffee shops like this offer okay quality food since they are more focused on the taste of their coffee. This place had amazing quality in both areas. I'm not from this area. I'm from Miami and came to Canada on vacation. My cousin who lives here decided to take my family and I to Alchemy. The fried chicken and waffles is the best I've ever had, including the places I've tried in Miami. I only tasted one bite off of my mother's plate just to try it. My dish was the Peameal eggs Benedict. The dish comes with what I'm assuming was an English muffin topped with cheese, avocado spread, and the eggs. The flavors were a perfect combination. For a small coffee shop, this was one of our best stops during our vacation. The atmosphere is also very relaxing and cozy and everything served comes out beautifully in terms of presentation. Alchemy is definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"When we arrived at Alchemy Coffee, it was pretty full in there.  The tables were all taken, and people were sitting at the counter seating overlooking the parking lot.  All of the people sitting down were eating breakfast/brunch consisting of eggs, bread and french fries alongside a cup of coffee.   Good thing I was just looking for a cup of joe to go.  Trying to get a table to sit, wouldn't happen anytime soon.  So I ordered my usual latte, and the hubby I think got a flat white or a macchiato.  I can't remember, and apparently I only took a picture of my drink.  We ordered and had to wait a LONG time for our drinks.  I don't know if it was because they were still new at doing what they do, but for coffee, I think it was way too long.  I got my latte first, and then still had to wait to get the hubby's drink.  I took a sip, and my latte was at best room temp.  I didn't want to make a stink, so I just sucked it up and didn't say anything.  A few minutes later, hubby got his drink, steaming hot.  After getting in the car, I told my hubby that my latte wasn't as hot as 'normal'.  My hubby noticed that the barista made my latte with 'leftover' steamed milk.  I'm sure it wasn't leftover like sitting on the counter for hours, but it was made for someone else's drink and I got the remnants.  The hubby's drink took longer and was hotter because it was freshly steamed.  Aside from the leftover milk incident, I didn't find their latte better than others.  Hubby didn't like his drink so much.  I asked him if he wanted to go back and give them a second chance (i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that they worked out their kinks), and he said no, that he would rather go to Starbucks instead.  And this is coming from the guy that usually has no opinion, and most things taste \"ok\"."}
{"text":"This place is a small gem. The self-service suits it well and keeps business bopping and moving. There's a giant chalkboard menu that you can browse and order at the counter as you please. They also have some KeepCups, Pilot Coffee and tea tins for sale.

 The barista/cashier/do everything guys are extremely friendly, making it an even more pleasant experience. The matcha latte was beautifully crafted and wasn't too sweet. The food was pretty damn good too as we got the peameal eggs benny and the chicken and waffles - both delicious and seasoned just right. 

It's overall just a great brunch spot and cafe. Definitely a must see if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday afternoon with a friend and it was already pretty packed. We ordered the smoked salmon benny and chicken + waffles. Both were delicious and I'd highly recommend it. For the drinks, we ordered an ice coffee and a green tea latte. I've heard the rave of their green tea latte from people, but I was very disappointed. It tasted very powdery with very little matcha flavour. The coffee, though, was amazing!! It's a lot better than Aroma, which is what I'm used to. 

4.5/5 stars
-0.5 for the green tea latte"}
{"text":"Amazing food and coffee. What a quaint little coffee shop. Much needed in Markham. So far I've tried their salmon Benedict and shrimp omelette."}
{"text":"Love this uptown brunch spot! The chicken and waffle was really good and came with a sweet and slightly spicy sauce which brought together the two items well. I also tried the open faced omelette with pan fried shrimp, avocado, and cheddar which was also quite tasty. Their tea lattes are not bad.

The only con about this place for me is that it's usually quite crowded on the weekends and doesn't seat very many. Definitely worth checking out though!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star with room for improvement

I have been waiting... Waiting forever for an indie coffee shop in Markham. It is kind of sad but I am glad that Alchemy Coffee finally opens.

Dropped by during Soft Opening today and I do love the vibe. 

Cappuccino 6 oz ($3.80 +tax) is A OK though on a pricer side compares to other downtown indie shops but being the only one around, the price is justified. I always love Pilot Coffee Roaster. The espresso was pulled nicely with a hint of cocoa but sadly the milk did not frothed properly hopefully that would be resolved before their grand opening.

They also offers hot food so you might want give it a try.

Barista is nice and friendly which is important to the success of any indie coffee shop.

I will be back for my coffee fix.

Good Luck Alchemy Coffee!"}
{"text":"The space is small and cozy. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The shrimp open face omelet was delicious but the house fries were a tad too salty. The mocha is yummy and not too sweet. It comes with foam art. The presentation of the food looks good! Service was great and the staff was really friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Excellent food, limited menu, but when it's this good it doesn't matter, they're more focused.  Very cramped space, but clean, and the staff was efficient and friendly.  A little pricey, but again, really really good fucking food."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places for breakfast/brunch places in Markham. It is a small but cute place which has nice ambiance and decor. I would recommend going either on a weekday or very early in weekends as this place fills up quickly! There aren't many seats so it is not ideal for large parties 
. Parking is also another issue where most of the plaza has designated parking spots for each business however it doesnt seem Alchemy has their own spots except to the very side od the palza which is very limited. It is somewhat of a self serve place where you order at the front and yoh find your seat and the food is brought to your table.

I ordered the matcha latte and the eggs Benny with peameal bacon, spinach and avocado spread. ($14) It was very flavorful, the egg was nice and runny and the potatoes were very fresh and we'll seasoned. The matcha latte had a beautiful design and had an even better taste with a smooth matcha flavor.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good coffee. They use Pilot. Came across this cafe one afternoon, was glad I did. It has a downtown feel, not at all pretentious and apparently has good food too but I came after the kitchen closed (@3pm) so I ended up getting a flat white. It was pretty nice, good espresso and milk ratio. The vibes are cool, and they close at 6!"}
{"text":"It's self seating. Don't bother coming during peak brunch/lunch hours. It's so small and wait times are 30-45 minutes. You'll basically just stand around and hope someone gets up so you can take their seat(s). Bad for groups."}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience. The pancakes were so soft and perfect. If you go with a group, I suggest you share it so you can try the other stuff. I got the classic brekkie and it was good, although you really can't go wrong with eggs, sausage, homefries and toast. I also got a hot chocolate and it was really tasty. My aunt got a matcha latte and she said it was delicious, she also enjoyed her matcha cookie. My other aunt got the shrimp omelette, she said it was okay and how she could probably make it herself... But I liked my experience. The only thing I don't like is the self seating arrangement because it can get crowded really easy as it is a small place. With this arrangement, it feels very foodcourt and you'll have people waiting right beside your table eyeing you for when you're done."}
{"text":"This review is based on two visits: once to try their drinks and use their location to study - and the other as a brunch restaurant.  There are not too many independent coffee stores in Markham, so this is really a welcomed change.

In general, the small restaurant definitely spent some time in creating a modern warm atmosphere with its wooden tiles on the walls and simple furniture.  There are probably about 30 seats in total around the restaurant.  While studying, I ordered a London Fog and it was made well with a perfect amount of vanilla.  There was a good free wifi at the coffee shop with outlets available.  I went on a weekend at about 4PM and there were a decent amount of people - so it wasn't awkward to study but it wasn't filled to the point where I felt guilty for taking a table.  It was then that I noticed its brunch menu, which made me decided to bring my friends the following weekend.  As a study place, I think it is worth 5/5.

As a brunch restaurant, we went on a Sunday morning at about 9AM and it was already starting to fill up.  I wasn't a huge fan of having to order at the front - but at least they brought our drinks and food over to us (however, tips is not expected like in other restaurant because you're paying at the front before you get your order). I got a Latte - and it was well made with latte art to complement the drink.  Of note, they use Pilot Roasters Coffee.   I ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benny. It was a good Eggs Benedict - but it wasn't anything too special in my opinion. I enjoyed the potatoes (they were actually very good) and the salad as well.  By the time it was 10:30AM, the place was filling up and people were waiting for tables - so we felt obligated to leave. I think the restaurant is receiving a following from its Markham foodies.  As a brunch restaurant, I would give it a 4/5.

Overall, good food with GREAT coffee that's unique to the Markham Scene.  I would study here.  They are currently in their soft launch phase - and they are quite explicit with that on Facebook.  They also update their Facebook regularly, which is appreciated - so before going, I would check Facebook to make sure they are in stock of what you're hoping to try."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch since everyone was buzzing about this place.  It's a tiny place and you have to seat yourself when there's space.

I loved their matcha latte and their matcha cookie. So yummy and not too sweet which I like.  Their buttermilk pancake is the bomb too.  It was really soft and fluffy when you eat it.

They have more choices you can get.  I think the next time I will try the pork belly omelette or the smoked salmon eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Well made food and coffee for a reasonable price.  It's quite busy and not very big but people don't normally stay long."}
{"text":"May be a little bit of a wait but the food is delicious and their coffee is to die for"}
{"text":"Amazing! I was so impressed that I'm writing this review. I had eggs Benny and BF had chicken waffle with latte. Everything was delicious. Everything tasted freshly cooked and prepared. I'm not a salad eater but I ate the salad too! Service was fantastic and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place and I will come back again. I live in Scarborough but this place was worth the travel."}
{"text":"Nice environment ... Feels like a classy coffee shop from movies lol not a lot of seating tho tonight need to wait bit when it gets busy.  Food was nicely done and staff was nice enough to correct my order when they got it wrong. Overall very polite staff, food was above average , and environment was quite to nice"}
{"text":"Big fans of this place they serve good food and good coffee. All the dishes are very good and worth trying except the pancake might still have space to improve. I love their pork belly omelette, chicken waffles and smoke salmon salad, and they have the best ice mocha in town."}
{"text":"Alchemy has been around for a year now, and it definitely has become one of the coolest brekkie spots in Markham. I'm usually quite excited to come here, since it is arguably the only one in the hipster category.

Place is tiny. It's not a shoebox, but it'll definitely get packed fast. That being said, the interior is beautiful. I'm a sucker for wood anything and this place is boarded with it. All the decor really matches well and is high quality. It's cozy and a great place to have a good breakfast.

The food is quite good. It is on the pricier side and the portions are not that huge, but the quality is there. Your dishes look beautiful when they come out and it's clearly crafted with care. The drinks are also quite tasty as well. My friend ordered a matcha latte and while it was bitter, you can definitely taste the real matcha flavour.

Service was also great. Very welcoming and knew what they were doing.

I love Alchemy Coffee and I come back as much as I can. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This morning, they made me a perfect cortado. A perfect cortado is hard to find. I love are Te Aro's cortados and this was just as good. 

So happy to find an indi coffee shop up North, near my office, that is on par with the quality of dt indi-coffee shops."}
{"text":"Sadly, my husband and I visited right before they were closing so we only got a chance to try their hot drinks. I got the matcha latte which was very creamy, not too sweet and had a strong matcha taste to it - just the way I like it. My husband got the London fog which had a hint of lavender and vanilla flavour. Both excellent drinks under $10! Will definitely come back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"I was kind of getting a bit sleepy so I decided to pop by here for a coffee.  The prices for the food on the board were ridiculous to begin with, but that wasn't my intent for the visit.

I decided to get an afogatto just so I get some extra sugar.

I was just sorely disappointed in what came out.

If it is gelato, it's probably a hagen daas version as it felt and tasted like ice cream.

The espresso shot wasn't too strong either.

I just went to Starbucks shortly after."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Alchemy for brunch because I saw so many posting about it that I wanted to try it for myself. I waited about half an hour for a seat for two. Minimal seating area. I came during the winter and my chair had no back panel. It was irritating having to keep my jacket in my lap while I eat. Didn't notice any hangers but maybe I missed it. Once you get a seat, you order and pay first and they'll bring you your food. Our order consisted of a latte, eggs benny and chicken + waffles. Following the half an hour wait standing by the door, it seemed like forever before we actually got any food on our table. Normally at this point I'm starving and ANYTHING tastes good to me, but the food honestly wasn't that great. The Chicken + Waffles was pretty dry and the poached eggs on my Eggs Benny weren't very runny. The hollandaise sauce and the salad dressing also tasted funny. The potatoes were also dry. Come here if you want good food pictures, but go somewhere else if you actually want good food."}
{"text":"OMGSOGOOD!!! They absolutely deserve all their rave reviews.

I came here with Superwoman on a Sunday because one of her friends, who's a major source of food inspiration for her, had posted some photos on Facebook. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much because Markham just didn't strike me as a place that would have cool brunch spots, for whatever reason. I mean, can you imagine a place like Beast or the Drake hotel existing in Markham? I couldn't, anyway, and I'm not even sure why. But I agreed to come here because Superwoman was convinced it would be good, and to my delighted surprise, she was right.

We made our way here at maybe 2pm and we had a bit of a wait. No one greeted or directed us, so we occupied the first free table when it was our turn, which someone promptly cleared/wiped, and I went up to the front to ask if I was supposed to order up there. Turns out I was.

We decided to get the smoked salmon eggs benedict and the pork belly open omelette to share. To cut the grease and fat, we both ordered cold earl grey teas, which we had plain.

It was so good!

The smoked salmon eggs benedict was executed to perfection. Had to be one of the best eggs benedicts I'd ever had. The egg was perfectly cooked, the sauce was just right - rich but not too heavy, creamy but not thick, buttery but not fatty, juuust the slightest hint of acidity but not sour at all. It was seasoned just right. It really was great. The roasted potatoes they came with were also fantastic - low starch potatoes, cooked and spiced perfectly until they were slightly crisp on the outside but tender on the inside. They were nice and dry, no pools of oil on the plate. And it came with a truly delicious salad - some kind of exotic spring mix with a really tasty dressing that was not tart (I hate really sour dressings so I often eat salads plain) and it was nice and savoury. I suspect that the dressing was house-made, with miso, mirin, and...maybe some sake? Maybe some soy sauce. And oil. I could eat that salad every day. I can't believe I'd ever say that about a salad!

The pork belly open omelette was also excellent. When I saw the skillet it was served in, I expected the egg to be overdone but it really wasn't. It was smooth and just cooked through. The pork belly was spiced just right and melted in my mouth. The caramelized onion and the chard under the pork also complemented the pork and the egg perfectly. This also came with the aforementioned amazing salad.

This meal was not cheap - $15 and $14 for those dishes - but it was worth every penny. We look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"If I could wake up to the aroma of Alchemy Coffee's Matcha Green Tea Latte, and the smell of their super fluffy buttermilk pancakes every morning, getting up on Mondays wouldn't be so hard. Order their Peameal Bacon Eggs Benny and BAM, you get double the trouble. Everyone should start off their mornings on a high note! 

Get there early, or be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I came by for brunch again the same week with a friend and we both enjoyed our eggs benedicts. We both shared the smoked salmon and peameal bacon eggs benny. Portions were big (I couldn't even finish my potatoes!) and I was glad there was salad on the side too. I liked how the peameal bacon had avocado which worked well together. 

It was busy when we first got there but people came and went and service was quick. I can't imagine how busy this place gets on the weekend if we came on a weekday. Overall, it's nice to have an independent coffee shop/cafe/brunch place around this area since there isn't much nearby. Again, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat or get coffee here, but if I'm ever around the area would definitely go here to chill and relax (maybe with a good book!)."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place for breakfast. Seating is a little awkward because no one really seats you. You have to stand in line and get seated while negotiating with others for the right number of chairs, etc. Getting past that, you order your food at the counter, pay and just wait for it to come. Nice menu. We had a couple of variations of their eggs Benedict, one with preamed ham and another with salmon. Both good. Their coffee, latte and tea selections were good. Prices reasonable. Ambiance pretty nice but cozy and people seated close to each other. Servers were very helpful and nice.

We will visit this place again for sure."}
