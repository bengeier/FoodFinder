{"text":"Crave is the best place for vegetarian or vegan place to eat unless you want to add on protein... staff there are really helpful and the food are yummy."}
{"text":"*Will update with picture! 

Didn't like it the first time I got it - Banh Mi. 
Overly sauced and my kale was rotten - it was soggy and not fresh. 

Second time - Il Padrino 2.0 - supposed to be steamed but don't be mistaken apparently that doesn't mean warm. It was cold as well. Huge puddle of oil.

Wasn't full after both times."}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill significantly. Portion size has been reduced either by management or staff significantly. Ingredients like tomatoes and salmon are either less than fresh or just not well-chosen. The Company does not respond to email concerns. Shame because I generally like the menu otherwise, but the value has made this a pass."}
{"text":"One word.  Inconsistent.  We all got the cleopatra, all varying in portion sizes - mine being almost half the amount as my colleagues.  $14 for a meal that left me hungry 30 minutes after - no thanks.  Waste of money."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick breakfast before work, you should try their breakfast menu. Personally, I love their MORNING RUN! 
It's filled quinoa and yogurt topped with fruits, lemon curd, splash of syrup and nutmeg. 

It also has almonds on it, but I prefer with pecans. So if you're a pecan-type-of-person, you should definitely ask for that.

I also asked for raisins on top to give that tangy-sweet taste on my yogurt. If you like raisins, ask if it's available. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up a lunch and decided to try the Crimson Dawn box on brown rice, which is steamed kale, asparagus, mushrooms, zucchini, rainbow peppers and sun dried tomato sprinkled with pumpkin seeds. The taste? Ehh, they're steamed veggies.  Nothing to write home about, but my guess is that this kind of stuff isn't meant to really meant to impress your taste buds anyway. 

So I make my judgement of Crave based on these other factors instead:
- Sauce provides most of the flavour and in my case, the pom puree and garlic basil pesto provided a much-needed wakeup call to the tempeh (which on its own tastes like a slightly salty, dense tofu) 
- Vegetables are fresh and vibrant
- Pricing I think is more reasonable in comparison to its competitors, including the fact that they thankfully don't have additional charge for extra sauce
- Bottled, fruit-infused water tastes more like water with stale fruit inside. I'd say skip this stuff and just go for the Perrier instead
- There's a constant lineup at the cash and customers waiting for their food, but don't be worried as it moves quickly

All in all, I'm willing to come back again for another healthy-style lunch again!"}
{"text":"I am not a health-conscious eater.  In fact, even the thought of salad makes me grumpy.  I would never choose healthy food over tasty food.... but now I don't have to.  

The Californication steam box includes quinoa (you can choose to get brown rice), napa cabbage, snow peas, corn, peppers, and alfalfa sprouts.  Sounds terrible but was delicious!  All the ingredients complimented eachother well and went great with the tempeh that I had added. It filled me up without making me feel gross and helped me get through the rest of the day without snacking.  No 4pm hanger surprise!  It also comes with 2 sauces on the side (Next time I will opt to get 2 of the hot sauces instead of the peanuty one).  A guilt-free lunch for $11 taxes in.  Not bad for the underground path.

Other menu options include breakfast, soup, and cold boxes.

Verdict: I am a fan and no longer believe that healthy means bland/dull food.  Will definitely go back to this place and recommend it to all.

Bonus:  they have a 'take a book, leave a book' case close to the pick-up area."}
{"text":"Good value (considering the location), fresh and tasty food. It was also a pleasant surprise to find the serving sizes to be generous."}
{"text":"New spot for healthy eaters in the west end of the path, underneath 120 adelaide, near the york/adelaide stretch of the path. the place offers clean food with a delicious twist and has similar aesthetic characteristics. 

the place is conveniently located and easily spotted near the starbucks and rexall and is also reacheable form the outside with entrance directly from nearby buildings and even a direct entrance to the path from the outside near the york/adelaide intersection (north east corner). it has an appeal to the \"clean\" eating types. The place has an app which makes it  easy to order food. 5/5 for the place

the food is unprocessed (for the most part with the exception of some condiments and cream cheese) , clean and very fresh. each item has a good texture, freshness, a mixture of colours (means good for vitamin variety). the kitchen is open, which makes me trust them more, compared to hidden kitchens. the problem with the path has been that it is hard to get fresh, clean, unprocessed, nutrient-dense foods. you can argue and probably you would be right in finding a place that has some of these but not all of these criteria. food 5/5

the service is quite good and I never have to wait on my food for long. servers are generally nice. crave has an interesting ordering system, one is that you can pay with the app, but the second interesting part is that after you order there is a distinct sound made by the speakers, indicating to the servers that an order has been received and that it is time to prepare it for the customer. service has been great overall 5/5

reasonably priced when you consider other healthy option and definitely a great bang for your dollar!!! 5/5 

looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I've only tried Crave once, I ordered on Ritual because they were having a \"First Time Taste\" promotion and I ordered the Gusto box and I subbed the chicken for tempeh. This was also my first time trying tempeh and I was pleasantly surprised at how flavourful it was. They also didn't skimp on the tempeh, there were a good number of large pieces in my box.

The box contained \"massaged kale\" and I thought that was just Crave being extra but I think I've been converted. Massaged kale somehow tastes so much better than regular kale. I don't know why. There was a light dressing on the salad and it tasted great, it didn't have any of the strong flavour that kale usually has, it was very pleasant. 

The other toppings were fresh as well and overall a decent portion size. I was full about 3/4 of the way through the box. The food also didn't make me feel heavy or gross as some foods tend to do.

I would definitely try this place again, especially if Ritual does more promotions. Normally, the prices seem a bit high for what you're getting because it's essentially all vegetables."}
{"text":"compared to the other options in the PATH this place is a really good choice, as they have done a fair job of creating healthy and fresh dishes through reasonable price, but of course not the cheapest option around as a result."}
{"text":"I really like this place for work lunch/dinners that don't send me back to my desk feeling lethargic or bored. The portions are good, the ingredients are colourful, taste fresh and seem to be of high quality and the flavour profiles are surprisingly distinct for a PATH boxed lunch; real spicy Mexican themed dish, good pesto in the zucchini noodle dish, crunchy kimchi, etc. The combinations taste well thought out. Bowls are not bulked up by excessive grains, as is often the case in these sorts of inexpensive \"fast healthy\" places. 

They have Ritual, as well. 

Yum."}
{"text":"This place is unreal. Totally underrated! I love the il padrino for lunch and the morning glory for breakfast ! So amazing"}
{"text":"I'm not a health but, but do like to eat healthy from time to time. If u can cook me up some healthy fast food, I'm loving it. But when it's tiny portions of bland healthy food... Pass!

Servings sizes are like a side salad, and the salmon I added were two thumb sized pieces (albeit nicely seasoned and cooked). 

For roughly $12, If you want a very light healthy snack, but I wouldn't call this a meal."}
{"text":"You have to try this place out if you are looking for lunch around the area. The ingredients that they use are very fresh! I buy breakfast and lunch here all the time. Never let me down. 

They dont have a huge selection of salad options which is what I like. Its kind of painful to choose from a complicated menu. they do their salad dressings right and give you a good portion. 

I usually go for the Unagi or Hale Kale. Both are delicious. You can add chicken or salmon. But I think adding meat is too much food for me. Keeping in mind that they do give you a decent amount of green stuff."}
{"text":"This review is purely based on my Mealpal experience.  As such, please kindly disregard this for regular purchases as the quality may differ.

I have never thrown away a Mealpal order until now.  Even when my sushi burrito was dripping with excess liquid like a wet towel, I soldiered on because I normally don't like wasting food if it is still edible.  However, the Gusto I ordered from Crave Healthy Habits was beyond salvageable.  The Gusto is a mixed salad with chicken, avocado, and leafy greens.  When I arrived to pick up my Gusto, I noticed that all the Mealpal orders for the day were already made and were left sitting on the counter until their respective owners picked them up. Pre-making Mealpal orders isn't unusual for participating restaurants, but the quality just avalanched for my Gusto.  The avocado  already had black-brown patches and a rotten taste, meaning it probably wasn't the freshest even before it oxidized. The chicken was dry and scarce. The leafy greens that took up the majority of the box seemed wilted.  Even the two salad dressings that came with the Gusto were sour. They were dairy based, so it's possible that the dressings were left out on the counter for too long. After two bites, I threw the whole box into the garbage. Despite the restaurant's self-proclaimed healthy menu items, this seemed worse for my body than stuffing myself with cake. I warn you to stay far away from here for your next Mealpal order."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Got the time oats as recommended and it was GOOD! I felt the price was reasonable for the amount + quality of ingredients. It was loaded with strawberries, grapes, bananas, pecans, blueberries and oats. I'm actually not a big oats fan, and every time I have it I either cannot finish it or dislike it altogether. But this was perfect for me, not too watery or mushy, it was still warm when I picked it up and it went really well with the fruits. Not too sweet either, I would like to try their other items!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location to the one located at the Richmond-Adelaide Centre! Located just across the McDonalds and Tim Horton's in the TD Food Court (West Tower), this Crave location actually has a seating area and a bigger menu! (The Richmond-Adelaide Centre location doesn't serve the breakfast menu). It's also accessible via the underground PATH.

This location is definitely busier, but still so incredibly efficient. You don't have to wait too long to order, your food comes out within 5 minutes of ordering (even during the lunch rush!), staff are so friendly, and there's a decent amount of seating. Compared to other lunch options in the PATH (which you really get sick of after awhile), Crave is a saving grace. 

I ordered the 'Morning Run' for my visit today, which is a mix of quinoa, yogurt, almonds, bananas, strawberries, blueberries, nutmeg, maple syrup and lemon curd. So delicious, and decent price point. My total came to just over $6.00. (Salads come to around $11, on average - pricey, but the ingredients are super fresh with wonderful flavours). 

Can't wait to continue trying the rest of their menu. What a great lunch option right smack in the middle of the Financial District!"}
{"text":"My life's first ever food court win.  I'd even eat here as a destination meal.  amazing"}
{"text":"The only place I get lunch in the core. This place is so good, I love bringing people here for the first time. Not sure how the calories compare to IQ, because they don't post, which is the only downfall, but the flavour-scale is off the charts. I get the Unagi 4 days a week and treat myself to the Bahn Mi on Fridays. Crave is the best!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this location because they have a seating area and serve breakfast as well! Often, I'll just order through Ritual and pick it up on the counter - super convenient. I'd recommend their Time Oat: the flavours meld together so well; every mouthful feels like they've given you the perfect amount of each ingredient. Plus, you feel quite full with dem chia seeds! For lunch, there's not one box I don't like from Crave though, I do make the frequent return to Enso, Gusto, and Il Padrino :)"}
{"text":"SO REFRESHING.
If you're growing tired of IQ, give Crave a try. It's located in the Richmond-Adelaide center adjacent to the Starbucks that's across from a Rexall. 

I've tried two boxes and would get both again. The dressing is always provided on the side (win!) and is super tasty. All the greens are fresh and crisp. You line-up to order, pay by cash or credit, and give 'em your name. Then, wait to be summoned to receive your delicious lunch box.

Tried - 
STEAMED: \"Il Padrino\" is a zucchini pasta with loaded green goodness and a delicious garlic-free basil pesto. 
COLD: \"Lulumelon\" is an interesting arugula salad with watermelon, chickpeas, edamame, corn, cucumber, feta cheese, mint, basil, quinoa or brown rice + avocado basil. 

Do something different for your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"I have been wondering about this place  tried Fiyaf, which was chicken, beans, rice and more. It was yummy, healthy, meat was a bit dry though... it was hard to find this location, it is a tiny little pick up place, staff were fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is delicious. There's lots of great variety. Pretty healthy too. I'll be going here often. They also have snacks and drinks. Haven't tried their app where you can order ahead of time and get a discount. Lots of people seem to use it though. Just need to pick your order up whenever you can."}
{"text":"I tried the Hale Kale and The One lunch boxes.

HALE KALE
(quinoa or brown rice, kale, spinach, sweet potatoes, tamagoyaki, nori seaweed, carrots, orange, red pepper marmalade, pepitas, parsley)

THE ONE (added chicken)
(quinoa or brown rice, chickpeas, edamame, corn, asparagus, mushroom, wild rice, dried barberries, feta cheese, oregano)

Both were very bland - no sauces were added.
I guess this is healthy because there's barely any taste to it... :("}
{"text":"Maybe I didn't pick well. Spent 13+ tax on the frida bowl. It's mainly lettuce which has no nutrition. Small piece of mahi mahi that turned out to be ice cold. Chips taste burnt. Disappointed af."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy options. Adorable staff. Fast service. I would suggest checking your sauce to ensure it's what should come with your meal. My fav meal is Californication. Don't be dissuaded by the lineup, it moves fast."}
{"text":"Healthy, tasty combos. A bit grain heavy for my tastes, but certainly much lighter fare than you'll find nearby. 

I ordered The One and was pleasantly surprised by the huge portion size and how satiating it was. I didn't get hungry until dinner time, despite not adding any protein!

For the price, I would liked to have received more of the asparagus, mushrooms, and chickpeas, and less of the filler veggies (i.e. corn) and brown rice. They do let you personalize how much brown rice versus wild rice you get, though!

Overall this was a very welcome healthy break from the usual at a relatively affordable price for downtown."}
{"text":"So basically, I bought grass for lunch. But, hey, don't knock it till you've tried it - this was still a tasty and appetizing meal!

After hearing good things from various colleagues, I visited around 12:45 PM on a Wednesday afternoon and the lunch rush was basically over (lineup was very minimal). Unlike iQ Foods, I didn't have to wait 25 minutes just to order, food preparation was quick and efficient (I received my order less than 10 minuets after paying), staff were friendly and sweet, and very welcoming. 

I ordered the Californication Lunch Box (cabbage, snow peas, corn, peppers, alfalfa sprouts, peanuts, sesame seeds on quinoa), chicken, and honey sesame and thai peanut sauce.  Don't let the picture fool you - this was actually really appetizing. The sauce made the salad - a wonderful sweetness, and the ingredients were extremely fresh, the veggies so crispy, great temperature, and by the end of the meal, you feel super refreshed. 

Yes, it's pricey, and portion size is just average. But, taking the whole experience into account (staff, wait times, freshness of ingredients, careful preparation, and decently sized menu), it was pleasant, and I'll be back. 

For my salad, I paid $11.26 after taxes. Note that the Richmond-Adelaide Centre location does NOT serve their famed breakfast menu (the TD Tower location does)."}
{"text":"Crave is my new favorite spot for breakfast and lunch. They have a great variety of fresh and healthy options and their staff is super friendly. I highly recommend trying the Bahn Mi or Gusto."}
{"text":"*Crave Healthy Habits is a chain that aims to serve healthy food choices that are both nutritious and tasty, yet at affordable prices.

*I can't speak for their salad, but the breakfast boxes are affordable, delicious and very nutritious! 

*Despite locating in a food court, Crave is spacious and very modern looking, which is completely different than other stores in the same food court.

* Because of the open kitchen concept, you can see all the fruits are freshly prepared right in front of your eyes. Occasionally Crave will run out of certain fruit, and the staff have always happily given me more of any fruit that I want, such as strawberry!

*Do note that Crave only sell their breakfast boxes from 7AM to 11AM with the exception to the yogurt parfait, and all other items on the menu is for lunch from 11AM to closing.

-Time Oat -$5: 
 I have always asked to substitute pecans with almonds on all my orders, and I'm sure the staff have known me by now because of this lol. The rolled oats were soft and warm, not too mushy or gluey. I found the texture of the strawberry avocado puree is more of a syrup, which is actually even better as I felt a creamier puree might be too heavy and filling for this. Although it was quite bland on its own, but mix it well and the natural sweetness from the fruits and the sweet puree really boost up the flavor of the rolled oats.

-Morning Run - $5: 
Another really heathy and high protein choice! Again, loved the natural sweetness from the fruits and I like how there was just a touch of maple syrup, so the entire dish isn't too sweet. I believe the yogurt is sugar-free as well and it was just a bit tangy. The lemon curd was such a nice surprise addition and it really gave a nice zing to wake you up in the morning! However I prefer the Time oat than morning run as I found Time Oat to be more filling yet not too heavy in the tummy :).

-Yogurt Parfait - $4: 
For $4 the portion was huge and it's actually even cheaper than the ones at Tim Hortons or Starbucks! I believe the parfait at those two shops cost around $3-4 and they aren't exactly healthy lol... Note that the yogurt parfait is available throughout the day so if you are looking for a mid-day snack that is similar to the morning run, get this!

-Santorini - $5: 
Other than yogurt or rolled oats, Crave also offer toasts for breakfast as well. I actually only got this once and I'm not sure if $5 for this is justifiable. I guess it could be, but the portion was a bit smaller and I felt I can get something bigger like the rolled oats for the same price? Don't get me wrong though, this was absolutely delicious!  The fresh pomegranate seeds gave a slight crunch with every bite and really cut down the creaminess of the avocado. The puree was creamy and fresh, along with the distinctive sour flavor of the bread and drizzled with just right amount of olive oil, it was quite filling and satisfying!"}
{"text":"I've ordered lunch here a couple of times as I work nearby. Everything here is very healthy but expensive. Lunch boxes are $10+. it's just something different when there aren't that many options around.  
If you use ritual here they put all the orders on the counter with your name written on the box so you can pick it up yourself."}
{"text":"I love this place and being able to order on Ritual makes it even better.  I even customize my orders (no dressing etc.) and they always get it right."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for a healthy lunch.  Not only is it healthy but tasty too!  My 2 favourite lunch choices here is either the Banh Mi or Gusto.  If you worry that the salad is not filling enough, you can add rice for no extra charge.  I'm always very satisfied with the Banh Mi salad with rice.  It has a perfect mix of kale, cilantro, avocado, jalapeño, carrots, red cabbage, kimchi, and chicken...so refreshing and tasty! I was never a salad person until I discover places like Crave.  Never would have thought that I would have cravings for a salad!"}
{"text":"I'm not really much into the vegan eating but I do like to try to eat healthier when I can. One of the biggest barriers I find is price. Most of the \"raw\" or vegan/vegetarian places charge ridiculous prices that makes it financially prohibitive to frequent them. Crave prices their foods at prices that are very competitive to other food court shops. I'm definitely no expert but I did find the food to be filling as well as satisfying. 

If you're looking for an alternative to the pizza/burger/sub place definite try this one."}
{"text":"Don't advertise something as all-day breakfast if you only serve it until 11:00.  'Nuff said."}
{"text":"I've ordered breakfast here a couple of times and I have nothing but good things to say.  They're fast, efficient, and the food is amazingly healthy and fresh.  There is also an app you can download to make your experience even faster.  I have been extremely happy with my ability to decide what I want, hit send when I get off the subway and show up just in time to pick up my breakfast."}
{"text":"There's not much to say for this place but it being very healthy! I had placed a ritual order to pick up and they were right on time.  I felt really clean eating my lunch here and I would go to it everyday if it didn't cost so much."}
{"text":"Good breakfast options but so slow. They need to figure out a better way of getting food out the door. Not uncommon to take over 10 minutes and that is unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is a place I walked by several times a day but didn't stop because I assumed the food would taste like crap, even if it was good for you.  Last week, I saw a colleague getting lunch there and she convinced me to give it a shot.  I have been back four more times (in the last week).  So far, I have tried the Taj Mahal, Californication and Gusto (substituted salmon for chicken).  They were all good - my favourite is the Taj Mahal.  I would encourage anybody to try this place at least once."}
