{"text":"Sammies is by far the best Philly Cheese Steak in Toronto. I have been here multiple times and the food is immaculate. I would recommend the classic Beef Cheese Steak. The Crab fries are also a must have. Sammy is a genius in the kitchen and it is a treat to see him at work. Very modest prices are also a treat considering the quality of the food! Will definetly come back again!"}
{"text":"The food was sooooo good. Everything we got was amazing. The owners were so helpful and even customized an order for us. They were super nice and all of the ingredients they used were fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let its appearance fool you - this place is really, really good. The sandwiches are top notch (make sure you get the hot sauce) and the owner/proprietor is super welcoming and helpful. 

Everything I've gotten from illstyl3 has been super flavourful. Definitely a go-to for the area, and a welcome change from all of the corporate restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"i popped in for a bite before the movies and chose the crab fries. they were delicious--the seasoning was delicious, the crab meat generous, and they were really friendly. i'm going back to try a sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Why have I never gone here before? It's simply delicious. I got the cheese steak sandwich with good quality ingredients. The meat was juicy and tasteful and the hot sauce, y'all, let me tell you about the hot sauce! Their homemade hot sauce just works so well with this already great sandwich. I also got a side order of pizza fries and you'd think it's no big deal by the name alone, but it was fantastic. Best part? It was really tasty and didn't make me feel heavy or guilty. The owner was really nice and took the time to make sure the food was prepared with care.

I'll be trying their Paulie special next time, which was the owner's favourite when I asked him."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had in Toronto. And I've had one from different places. The bread is amazing and the meat, topping, and hot sauce are the bomb. Also serving size is generous. Service is a bit slow at lunch time, but time flew by as I was enjoying the conversation. Definitely the place for me for Phillies from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped by last night based on yelp reviews. A very small place that you'd miss if you weren't looking for it. After looking on Yelp, it was clear that they were known for their cheese steak sandwiches. For $10 that's what I ordered and got it as takeout. The sandwich is self was pretty good and surprisingly filling. The cook was a friendly guy and recommended the house favorite, as in the cheesesteak sandwich. I will definitely stop by this place again to try out some other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Class act all the way. Great service, tasty sandwiches and fair price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best Philly Cheese Steak in Toronto. Legitimately great sandwich. I ended up splitting the sandwich but wish I had an entire one for myself.

Also ordered pizza fries. Clever idea and it worked really well but the sandwich stole the show. Quality meat and veggies were cooked really well. The bun was the important part. The chef kept the buns warm in the oven. It had great soft texture to them without being toasted or crunchy. This was critical, as it helped soak up the juices from the meat. Hot sauce provided a great kick.

The chef/owner got that Philly attitude too. He's upfront and blunt, a very charming fellow.

Will come back here for sure. Right across from Scotiabank Theatre and the entertainment district of downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches I've had since moving here almost two years ago. If you've never been, go with the class philly cheesesteak your first time.

Next time you catch a movie at Scotiabank, wear a trenchcoat and stop at illstyle first, then smuggle in one of these glorious jawns."}
{"text":"Great personality from the staff, but there could have been a bit more filling in the sandwich. Good flavours though and generally good value for dollar!"}
{"text":"Mmm, reminds me of the hoagies in Philadelphia. Found my new sandwich shop for Toronto.

Ingredients are fresh and sandwich was delicious. Simple and satisfying. My only thing is I wish the bread was a but more softer (personal preference but my memories of Philly hoagies were that the bread was slightly crispy but ooh soo melt in your mouth soft).

Would definitely come back again. Weekday lunch hour rush was a bit busy, would recommend ordering ahead of time with ritual."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try a Philadelphia style sandwich and I finally did at Illstyl3 Sammies. The location is convince , ingredients are fresh and the owner/chef is  very personable. Finally a new sandwich place .  I can't wait to go back and try other items off their menu."}
{"text":"Great spot and deeee-licious sammies.
Owner is super friendly and conversational.
Big portions for the price.
Convenient for people living downtown.
Good grab-and-go lunch spot."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Had the philly cheeseteak american style and its easily best in city. Very authentic!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after living a stone's throw away for the past year. I don't consider myself the biggest fan of Philly cheese steaks, having tried some of the best in Philly, but never being fully impressed. Flash forward to last night when I had The Pizza Jawn Steak Sammie with fries. These sandwiches are seriously delicious and the fries with garlic aioli are the perfect complement. Its safe to say I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak in the city. The owner is from Philly so he knows what he is doing. 

The hot sauce is awesome.

The fries are incredible!

If you are in this neighbourhood, this is the best place to eat."}
{"text":"For a sandwich shop that is tucked away in an inconspicuous space in front of Scotiabank Theatre, it may be easy to miss.  However, after one visit, you'll say it has its own swagger.  The first thing you'll be doing is eyeing the stylelized graphics in  its tiny 200 sq ft space. Food and art collide here, and I'm not talking about the kind of art with cute, humanoid foods donning faces.  I'm talking about street art, as demonstrated by the graffiti of a large sammie  scrawled on the back wall.  Also, you'll enjoy a lively chat with the owner who passionately discusses about his cooking and who will, as a result, make you salivate even more while you wait for your order.  Coupled with the cooking shows/videos playing in the background, you'll be on the edge of your seat from hunger.  My gosh, the hunger pangs hurt even more when the owner drips the meat jus onto your porchetta sandwich in front of you!  However, just keep in mind that with patience you'll be generously rewarded with a hefty sandwich exploding with meaty flavour and a great balance of textures.  The porchetta sammie I ordered for Mealpal was a show stopper for me. It was juicy, soft, crispy, super-sized, and in all fairness a gastric journey for a discounted price of 5 dollars.  It was a million tiers above Subways and Mr.Sub. Just be mindful of the price, as its regular costs outside of Mealpal may bring it down a notch for you. Yeah, these sammies got style."}
{"text":"This is definitely a go to sandwich place...it has a character of its own...try the signature cheesesteak, you won't regret ;)"}
{"text":"Thumbs up for illstyl3 Sammies. I touched down in Toronto and was looking for quick food in the area near my hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the the chicken steak I had was. Prepared fresh to order and quick friendly service. I will be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheese steaksteak sandwiches in the city. The owners are very nice and one of them is from Philly as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of these sammies and an even huger fan of Germain & Mojgan. Delicious sammies, awesome owners who are excellent conversationalists, and convenient hours (open-late!). I'm looking forward to methodically making my way through the menu (tried the cheesesteak and mushroom, so far, both fabulous). 

illstyl3 is mostly take-out as there's limited seating available (prolly less than 10). All the same, watching Germaine put together the jawn is part of the waiting experience: the sizzle on the grill, drool-worthy aromas wafting, and TV blaring in the background for extra cool ambiance. 

See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"This joint is just a hole in the wall.  It is mostly for pick up orders but they do have a couple of stools.  I got the porchetta sammie.  It had pork of course, provolone cheese, rapini and sauce.

The porchetta sammie was very flavourful.  The sauce makes this a delicious sandwich.  This is much better than Subway and the sammie is longer than a sub.  I just wish that the sammie had more meat.  I may come back to try the Philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"This is my first review and illstyl3 has forced me to write one. I go there everytime I am in the area and boy I am never disappointed. 

The cheese steak is one of the best I have ever had but more importantly this small little joint is owned by an amazing couple and they cook with love. I haven't tried anything else besides the fries and cheese steak and as much as I would love to I just can't get enough of the cheese steak. 

Highly recommend to anyone passing by or after a movie at Scotiabank theatre (which is when I go usually)."}
{"text":"Really delicious food here, and an awesome atmosphere. It really is an experience. Great conversation with the people there while Seinfeld/Frasier is confusingly playing on the tv in the corner. You have these delicious smells wafting from the grill, as you're anxious to get your hands on your food. I don't know why, but I always end up here late at night, but I digress. The Tostones are a must have. Really excellent flavours. Honestly, I'm pretty you can get away with ordering anything here. Anyway, it's a really dope place to be, spending time, eating food, and just enjoying yourself."}
{"text":"sub sandwich joint in a great location.  very limited seating, maybe about 7 in total.  try to look past the msn-messenger-username-esque name, because the food here is really damn good.  the chef is from philly, so i would like to think that he knows his sandwiches.  also they call their sandwiches \"jawns\", and it doesn't get more philly than that.  very extensive and impressive menu, which i had an extremely difficult time choosing from.  yes, that is a good thing.  prices are close to $10.

i got the south philly sandwich, which had a LOT going on.  cheese and steak, as per the classic sandwich recipe, but with kale, hot peppers, garlic aioli, and hot sauce.  probably not the most authentic cheesesteak, but i don't care because it was delicious.  the meat had little to no seasoning, which some people may not like, but i can definitely appreciate that since it lets all the other flavours shine.  the garlic aioli might have been the x-factor in this sandwich - it really elevated it to some sort of next level.  the kale added good texture and, most importantly, vitamins.  hey look mom, i'm eating healthy now!"}
{"text":"These cheesesteak sandwiches are awesome! They use fresh ingredients -- the steak is cooked before your eyes and the French stick is not too hard but not too soft. You then personalize your sandwich with the toppings of your liking. The cook (who I think might also be the owner) is very friendly and remembers his regular customers. 
The price point on the sandwiches, which are very filling, is also quite reasonable -- it's what you'd pay for lunch anywhere else in this area."}
{"text":"I was expecting a quick, basic cheesesteak sandwich and was blown away by how delicious their food was. I highly recommend getting the works because the hot sauce/aioli and whatever else tasted just amazing. Great value/great flavour and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place ever since hearing about it on Suresh Doss's show on CBC One, solely because his description of their housemade hot sauce had me really excited. I'm a hot sauce obsessive and this one sounded awesome. Finally got around to ordering through Ritual and made a point of asking for hot sauce on the sandwich. Maybe I should have put in all caps, or actually asked them when I picked it up if they had remembered to add the sauce, but, you know, I kind of assumed they would be able to read and follow simple instructions... nope. No sauce. I didn't realize until I had gotten it home. Without the sauce the sandwich was just meh. The kale was a nice addition, I guess, but otherwise it was just meat and cheese on a bun. Probably about a bajillion calories for not much flavour, felt like a waste of ten bucks. They weren't even busy (only one other person when I went in, and the owner was on the phone) so there's really no excuse for not being able to make an order the way a customer wants it. It's not that hard!"}
{"text":"Just a hole in the wall, I'm surprised not more people have talked about this place. 

It was absolutely fantastic and the sandwiches are huge. The quality was great and although I was stuffed, I wish I got to try the pizza fries. 

Very charming interior as well, and the chef/owner always has some classic movies playing in the background."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Philly. One of the best I've ever had. Much better than any of the tourist traps in Philly."}
{"text":"I grew up in Philly and know my Hoagies. The quality of the bread is not quite perfect, but close enough. This is like a taste of home."}
{"text":"I was craving sandwiches at 3PM on a saturday, and busted out yelp. Came here based off the reviews. If you're in the area and looking for good food, seriously just go here. The sammy I had from illstyl3's was delectable and you can bet your ass I'll be back to order another one of them jawns.

I ordered a philly cheese steak. I've only ever had one philly cheese steak sub in the past, illstyl3's sammy truly blew me away. Enough for me to write a review within 20 minutes of eating there. Beef was tender, cheese was melted, bread was fluffy, sauces were superb and the kale was a nice touch for both color and flavor. Did I mention the peppers? This was all thrown onto a flat top grill and cooked to perfection. Ingredients really came together and the chef (Germaine) was incredibly friendly. 5/5"}
{"text":"Illstyl3 Sammies brings their A-Game when it comes to anything sandwich related. Serving up a selection of cheesesteak and hoagie inspired offerings that are done in a traditional Philly style, this tiny spot on Richmond Street West is definitely attracting new regulars by the day. A very friendly and passionate owner multi-tasks at a fast pace, as he greets customers and prepares their orders.

Must-try items:
Philly Jawn (chicken or beef)
Mushroom Jawn (chicken or beef)
Catfish Po'Boy
Tuna & Cheese Hoagie
Porchetta
Crab Fries

Everything on the menu is a good bet, pretty much. There's even wings if you dare. You can expect to pay $8.50 and up for a sandwich, but every penny is worth it.

This isn't fast food to say the least, so don't expect to be in and out in 3 minutes or less. Waiting and watching your food being made is part of the fun, and you can always call ahead. This is definitely a clutch addition to the Entertainment District and a great place to grab a filling lunch or dinner that actually tastes good."}
{"text":"I came here with the hopes of having a delicious philly style cheese steak. The flavour of the meat was good, but their was hardly any meat in the bun. Most bites were almost all bun. 
As a result it becomes a very expensive piece of bread ($10.45 including tax). 
I really wanted to like it. The guy behind the counter seems like good guy who is from Philadelphia but I can get way better value for my dollar elsewhere. 
I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is how frustrating it is to go to Philly to try a 'good' cheesesteak, only to find a better one right down the road from your office!

True story.

I've tried both Pat's and Geno's, and neither can hold a candle to this place. The bread is crusty but soft, the meat is juicy, the cheese and 'with'(onions) is spot on."}
{"text":"DANG. This place is legit. We got a few varieties of sandwiches and we let the chef dress it how he usually eats it. That hot sauce tho? DANG. So good. Go for the regular Philly cheesesteak if it's your first time and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Fantastic cheesesteaks. The employees are very friendly and the service is great. You can watch them make your sandwich over the bar, and it's clear that the food is made with care. Great spot if you are going to a movie at Scotiabank Theatre across the street. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Reviewing their \"Cheesesteak\" here:
So came into here, after a flick across the street (Scotiabank Theatre) around 9 PM.
Asked for a \"cheesesteak\" and no added extras (ketchup, mustard, etc.).
I have tried many \"cheesesteaks\" across Toronto and this one was the worst. 
The hoagie bun (bread) was long but dry and nothing special and the meat was chopped very finely (not a deal-breaker, but not great either)  and the cheese was melted off (see: evaporated) and akin to Kraft Singles (love it or hate it).
The main problem was that the bread was dry and the meat was very sparse for such a long hoagie bun, and some folks will be put off by the lingering Kraft Singles flavour.
The price was just over $10 so no excuse for this. Coca-Cola can was $2.00 (yes, $2.00).
Maybe their other sandwiches are above average, but avoid there cheesesteak.
Service was nice."}
