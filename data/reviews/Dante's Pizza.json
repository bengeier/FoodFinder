{"text":"Hands down the hot garlic ranch chicken wings are some of the best (if not the best) chicken wings I've ever had!  I also love the pepperoni bread and cheese breadsticks.  I'm a lover of butter & garlic and I always get a side of the garlic butter sauce to dip in.  Worth the drive for take out!!  Also, the staff are some of the friendliest people I've ever encountered in the food industry...always polite & courtious!"}
{"text":"This was excellent pizza and the pizza guy Andrew was courteous. You won't be disappointed. I love the sauce."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. I work 2nd shift so I order pizza a lot. I mean who wants to cook at 8 o'clock at night when you live by yourself? I sure don't. I love ordering from here because I get the same thing every time. I'm never dissatisfied with the  quality of the food they bring. The ingredients are obviously of good quality and the sauce is absolutely delicious. The staff is wonderful and in my experience everyone who's delivered to my difficult to find residence. Has been kind and more than patient with me when trying to describe to them where I live. I even get a courtesy call when the pizza is on it's way. I couldn't ask for better customer service. I'd like to take this time to thank all of you for your hard work and your commitment to presenting a quality product."}
{"text":"We had 2 carry out pizzas, and 2 salads with an order of baked Carrots and baked Brussels sprouts. Total bill was 72.00. Needless to say the pizza was soggy, and the salads were awful, Baked Carrots were full of flavor and Brussel Sprouts were fair. Won't be back, even though we had heard so much how great there pizza was."}
{"text":"This place has reopened.  I went there this past weekend and really liked it.  They have a deal right now for large with one topping for 8 bucks.  GOOD STUFF:  Solid pizza like the kind I grew up with- sort of medium thick crust with good crunch.  Sweet sauce- lots of toppings and good amount of cheese.  Inexpensive- I got the large with one topping for 8 dollar deal- normally it's only 9 bucks.    BAD STUFF:  Hmm.....I can't really think of many other than the place closed down last year and it's been pretty empty.  I hope they make it.  OVERALL:  Good solid pizza for cheap prices.  Family run.  They have a few tables there in case you want to eat it there....check it out."}
{"text":"Insanely awesome pizza. Not sure why else to write. You can see the staff actually like working here, this shows in their crafting of tasty pies! Our pizza gave me tears of joy! Anytime jalape√±os are on Pizza.....much like Ice Cube says.....it was a good day! Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"This is one the best, if not the best pizza in the city of Cleveland. The cheese steak and fries never disappoint either. The food is always on time and always piping hot. Skip the chain pizza spots and give this place a try."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Savannah for work. Someone at our place of business recommended Dante's for some real down home cooking...and they weren't kidding.   Let's start with the service. Ms. Lorraine is an absolute angel. She treats you like you belong here and has a sincere \"motherly\" quality about her. Second time here, she remembered my drink (Root Beer) and now the third time, just the same. She made honest recommendations about what was best for what we were looking for and was totally on point. She brought our food out as soon as it was ready and it was nice and hot! Really a pleasure to have as our server.  First time around, I had the meatball hero and it was uh-may-zing!! Best I've had in a looong time. Second time, the pizza I ordered was huge...super tasty...and everything about it was fresh. And here I am again for the third time ordering another pizza lol. My coworkers also ordered soups, open faced sandwiches, chicken sandwiches, and salads. All were good according to them...hence us coming back for more.  If you are looking for great Italian/American comfort food, this is the place to be. About two miles or so from the airport as well. Prices are more than fair and proportions are ample!!  Best bang for your buck in my opinion. Make sure you say hi to Ms. Lorraine...she'll take good care of you!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to celebrate Mother's Day on Sunday. We wanted to do a dine-in pizza place. The menu had many selections but we decided to do the potato skins for an appetizer and do a cheese pizza for the kids and a pepperoni, sausage, onion, and green pepper for the adults. They have beer but we all had soda, coca-cola not Pepsi (yay!!!) they also accommodate kids with chocolate milk but they only have the styrofoam coffee style cups with the coffee stirrers for straws.   Our waitress was amazing, and checked on us frequently. The pizza was good but nothing to write home about. But we definitely enjoyed the experience dining at Dantes. A true diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Most of the toppings are out of a can, and the cheese is flavorless and very low quality. Please get a real/fresh pizza pie elsewhere. Would never return or recommend."}
{"text":"I just moved into the neighborhood and Dante's is just up on the corner. I decided to order a pizza to go and it was good. They are so good that I trudge through the snow instead of calling some other place that delivers. I always seem to get the large 3 topping for $10. The place is small with just a few tables. It seems to be a busy takeout place."}
{"text":"This is my go to for a night in and pizza. The wings are great but the show stopper is the Dantes sub. This sub is huge!  could eat that monster for a week its so large. Love getting Dantes"}
{"text":"Stayed at a hotel around here and decided to order pizza. The staff was very friendly on the phone and when they dropped of the delivery. My dad ordered the gyro pizza and said it was great! I got a calzone and a salad and thought those were both amazing as well. Would go again next time in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Being from the Chicagoland area, I'd like to think of it as my right of passage to recognize good pizza. With that being said, there's a reason that I stop at Dante's every time I pass through Cleveland: it's outstanding and the service is just the same.   I always go for the half sheet and bring home the leftovers.    Until next time, Dante's!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and was mor than satisfied. We had a deluxe pizza which was very good. I was very impressed with the amount of toppings that were on the pizza. The sauce and crust were very good. We also ordered some wings which were excellent. Fried not baked. I can't say it's the best pie in town but it was very good."}
{"text":"Complete disclosure, I spelled the other place wrong and ended up here!  But once I realized I'm an idiot, I found a pretty decent pizza.  They have a decent deal with a 12\" 8 slice pizza for $9.99 with two toppings.  I went for basic pepperoni pizza.  This was a pizza for visiting at Fairview Hospital.  Yes you can bring food into the regular rooms.  Good pizza, not the best and the Cleveland.com winner in 2011 may have been speciality.  But for $10, its a really good deal.  The sauce is slightly spicy.  The service was really good."}
{"text":"I was craving some wings and after a little googling the interwebs told me Dante's Pizza had some pretty great chicken wings so I decided to make a stop. Unfortunately the internet lied to me. Staff was friendly on the phone and in person, and the food (seafood pizza, wings, side salad) was generally A-Okay, but... it wasn't great. I'm not going to count this place out, will probably give it a second shot, but the quest to find delicious, mouth watering, smack your mama wings, is still on!"}
{"text":"Awesome family run place. Pizza was perfect and fast service. Menu is also really big"}
{"text":"Came in for a night staying at the Sheraton with the family over Thanksgiving break and was very happy to find Dante's. We're from Chicago so we get our share of good pizza but Dante's held its own. I'd call it sort of mix between thin crust and hand tossed. Pizza was cooked perfectly...the crust was crispy on the outside but chewy once you broke the surface. You could tell the sausage wasn't the frozen out a bag on thrown on kind. Nice big irregular shaped balls of italian sausage. All four of us loved it and nice enough atmosphere for little kids even if it's not in the greatest of areas. We'll be back next year."}
{"text":"Great pizza in the WP!  Nice thick crust and lots of toppings cooked perfectly.  TOPPINGS are great quality and I especially love the sausage."}
{"text":"The pizza place is awesome!!! All their food is high quality and is delivered so fast. The staff is great and the one time we had an issue they resolved it right way no questions asked. A family owned business that easily blows away all chain pizza places and most other family restaurants. Stop paying a lot for bad food and pay a good price for awesome food at Dante's!!!"}
{"text":"Time to update my review since we're almost exclusively seeing Athens now (they were closed though for the holiday weekend)...The last couple times we've ordered the pizza at Dante's it has been soggy :( The deluxe, while I appreciate the fresh veggies, was so overloaded that it was watery and soggy so keeping that in mind I ordered just pepperoni tonight. And it was STILL soggy. The pepperoni were limp and greasy on top of the cheese. Ok, so why still a solid 3 stars? They have great wings, good salads and decent subs. I have a hard time giving a pizza place a solid rating when I just don't like their pizza, but I know plenty (including 2 at my house) who do like the Dante pizza, so I encourage everyone to make their own ruling on best pizza in West Park and give 'em a try. Maybe Dantes will be your one and only, as for me though, I'll be waiting outside Athens when it reopens!"}
{"text":"Salad was presented beautifully even as it was packed to go. Lots of veggies and plenty of meat and cheese.   Enjoyed the prolly cheese steak a soft crust with a light white garlic sauce that was smothered in cheese and loaded up with ribeye steak. The mushrooms peppers and onions were tucked neatly and orderly away under the hefty portions of steak. The mayonnaise was artistically drizzled across the whole pizza.   Dantes did not leave me wanting for anything. Great mom, sons and pop shop."}
{"text":"Dante's has great pizza. Ours was very fresh with just the right consistency to the crust. We wandered in after the car show at the IX Center, not realizing that Dante's is really a carry-out place, but there are a couple small tables and the guys working there this past Saturday were very accommodating. My wife and I shared a Supreme, and my kids said their Hawaiian pizza was the best they'd had. Only minor complaint was ours was a little skimpy on the sauce, but I'm sure that's something they could customize if we ordered again. I'd certainly order Dante's again if we lived near the area, and I really appreciated the flavor, freshness and friendly service."}
{"text":"Ordered for a second time in about 30-40 days and it is tasty! Chicken tenders are the best in town, would highly recommend.  Everything came hot as it did the first time.  Their dough/crust is good and the sauce is very flavorful.  I'm a pepperoni and cheese kinda guy but will definitely explore a little more in the menu."}
{"text":"Found this place in west park Cleveland and it's amazing. Place is super old school small and the staff was so sweet. Pizza was super tasty and loved it also ate some potato skins that were perfect."}
{"text":"This place is PHENOMENAL!!   Best wings you will ever find!!  Try the HGR (Hot Garlic Ranch).  Pizza is equally as good!!  Uses big chunks of sausage, not the little square \"rabbit droppings\" you find on other pizzas.  Place has been around over fifty years for a reason!  I grew up by the airport, and relatives ordered from Dante's when I was a baby.  I drove the Fairview Hospital employee shuttle 6 years ago when employees were bused from Brookpark Rapid to hospital, and would stop in almost every night for something.  Entire menu top to bottom is out of this world.  Wife and I like it so much, we actually GOT MARRIED at Dante's Pizza!!  Not just the reception, the ACTUAL CEREMONY!!  We love this place!!  Owners are great people!!"}
{"text":"Placed a large order to feed my moving crew (I just moved to the WestPark neighborhood) and had a great experience. I called a few days ahead and the girl I spoke with was helpful, patient and knowledgeable. The food arrived hot and exactly on time by a very friendly delivery guy. He welcomed me to the neighborhood and I thought that was kind. My family and friends really enjoyed the food- the wings were large and meaty, cooked perfectly. We tried the mild, BBQ, and garlic butter parmesan sauces. I loved the pizza- salty pepperoni, generous crumbles of sausage, perfect crispy crust and the right amount of sauce. A few people said it was a little greasy for them, but I blot my pizza anyway... I didn't think it was bad at all. My favorite part was the sandwich. The Dante special is a 15\" Italian sub with this amazing pepper spread on it. It was so delicious.   There are a lot of pizza options in WestPark and while I'm game to try them all, I will definitely be ordering again from Dante's!"}
{"text":"It's ok, i think the toppings are too large, too thick and somewhat undercooked. I suppose this style of pizza is Sicilian, not my favorite"}
{"text":"Possibly the best pizza I've had since the \"80's\"! Very friendly , can't wait to try other menu items! Keep up the awesomeness!"}
{"text":"This is me go to take-out pizza. It's tasty. They deliver quickly. They have always gotten my order right. Love the crust. Cheese sticks are a must."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is the BEST! Try the Philly cheesesteak it's excellent. The pizza is amazing (especially with their sausage). Even the fries are good. Crispy, hot and perfect amount of salt. I love this place and you will too!"}
