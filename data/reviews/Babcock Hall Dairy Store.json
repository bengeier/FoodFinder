{"text":"Oh my!!! This place is awesome!!! You can walk around to see how they make their ice cream! My favorite: Death by Chocolate hahaha"}
{"text":"In the years I have been at Madison I have always wanted to get a tour of the place and eat ice-cream. But coordinating a tour with 10 people is more difficult than it seems so I'm so glad when we finally get that going and we are all here! I joined one of their 'tours' cos a friend's parents were visiting and they really wanted to see how ice-cream is being made here. We were all really excited but the tour involved just standing by a glass panel overlooking the ice-cream and cheese making facilities and listening to someone read off a piece of paper about stuff. 

The tours can be scheduled anytime within usual working hours but to watch their ice-cream/cheese production you have to go in the morning. We arranged a morning tour so the best part was watching them pack huge amounts of ice creams into gigantic tubs ready for sale. 

The best part of the tour is that you get to eat ice-cream after the tour! I have always like cookies and cream and mint cookie. But my recent favorite is their pumpkin pie. It's lightly spiced and has graham cracker crust mixed in. I've heard it's a seasonal flavor, so a (big) part of me feels like getting a tonne of them to store in my freezer *wistful thought*

That said, you don't have to join/schedule a tour in order to eat ice cream. The dairy store is open 6 days a week so you can just walk in when you crave for some frozen treats. They also have pints and quarts in different flavors for you to take home. What I like is that getting those right at the dairy store saves you some money compared to getting them at other grocery stores in town. 

Their ice-cream serving is huge and the pricing is awesome. You get 1-2 scoops for less than $2! They don't only have ice cream, coffee/tea and hot sandwiches are also served, for those looking for a meal beyond the ice creams =)"}
{"text":"Best ice cream I ever eat in my life !!! 

You have to try the orange chocolate I loved it

The workers were super nice I will defiantly take my family back to this place for a ice cream."}
{"text":"Great ice cream and sandwiches at a reasonable fee. Nice little side trip."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! This is a landmark of Madison, and I recommend this place to anyone who wants an authentic Wisconsin experience. Their ice cream is thick and rich and delicious. Their flavors are always right on the dot, as well. I can never get enough of Babcock ice cream."}
{"text":"Best (value) ice cream on campus, more flavors than the daily scoops at the unions, and the single is cheaper yet almost the same size as the double in most ice cream places...and I believe the prepacked ones are cheaper too.
My personal fav is mint chocolate cookie. Some special flavors are impressive too: bec-key lime pie, berry proud parents. Lots to choose from so just come and find the 'significant flavor' of your own."}
{"text":"I grew up in Madison, so I've loved this stuff since I was a kid. This location is a weird kind of industrial place, but it still feels welcoming and get's the job done. Definitely go when you can tour the facility or sit outside!

My favorit flavors are White House (cherry vanilla), butter pecan, Mackinac Island Fudge (vanilla with swirls of thick fudge), and Grasshopper (mint with chocolate chips and marshmallow)
Very rich! 
And nothing lives up to it...I've searched and searched!"}
{"text":"This truly is as good as it gets!

Try the peanut butter chocolate ice cream, it's a velvety, luscious dream! 

Stay and wonder in the plant or if it's nice out, walk around the campus."}
{"text":"The best ice cream. No one in town, or in my ice cream experiences, competes with Babcock. This place has been around forever; just walking by or into the building brings back nostalgic feelings for me. I love mocha macchiato, cookies and cream, butter pecan - the classics. Yes, they have more imaginative flavors too but since the texture is so very silky and flavors so rich, I find more drawn to the \"basics\" so they can be appreciated more.

The sandwiches are also a quick, affordable lunch here. I used to regularly pick up paninis in a bag and bolt out of there in just a couple of minutes. While a little greasy at times, the ingredients appear whole, real, and worth it. Grab a cone and go for a walk around campus; my favorite is to stroll with ice cream around Allen Centennial Gardens."}
{"text":"This ice cream is alright! It's better than anything around, for sure. Other ice cream places can seem very artificial and too sugary - this place gets it just right. I recommend the chocolate peanut butter in a waffle cone."}
{"text":"When in Madison, Babcock ice cream is something that you must try before you leave. They're famous for their ice cream since Wisconsin is the land of cows. I had the mocha chocolate chip ice cream and the orange chocolate chip ice cream. I feel like you can never go wrong with mocha. The orange, luckily, wasn't too tart-like. The ice cream was very smooth and, I must say, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Yum! I need to have ice cream for breakfast more often. I might've gotten a funny look. But hey, sometimes that's just how I roll."}
{"text":"Every time we come up here there is something new to try and to no surprise, equally delicious. I who hate chocolate, chose a chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips in it and was not disappointed. I finished both scoops and wanted more. If you're ever in Madison, don't leave without stopping in this place."}
{"text":"We are not alumni so we brought no nostalgia in to this visit. I guess we were expecting rather amazing ice cream being from the dairy state and the main college of that state and what we got was OK ice cream. It wasn't bad but not worth buying in bulk. 

We did really like the cheese and bought some of that in bulk. My family's main dietary needs are ice cream and cheese so we definitely got our fill. Beware the crowds but worth a stop if close."}
{"text":"YUM!!!

I got a single scoop of the Bo's Express ice cream - vanilla ice cream with raspberry swirl and chocolate flakes.  It was DELICIOUS!!!!  Even though it was like 38 degrees outside, I'm glad I got this ice cream on my visit to Madison.  Now if only I could find something close to that in San Diego......."}
{"text":"The ice cream is very creamy and rich, very, very, good! The clerk could have been a little friendlier but she wasn't grouchy either, just not welcoming. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"You won't believe me but I invented the Orange Custard Chocolate Chip back in, like, 1982.  I'm not fucking joking.  They had a comment box, and I wrote (yeah, I fucking wrote it, 'cause I was precocious af) that they should have a Halloween ice cream that was orange with chocolate chips.

Shame that it tastes like ass to me.

But you don't have to take my word for it.

Instead, try any one of the myriad flavors at this Madison institution that's existed longer than I have.  Which is a very long time indeed."}
{"text":"I've had the chocolate, strawberry, mocha macchiato, orange custard chocolate chip, pineapple cake, and raspberry swirl. All very good. It is always an internal battle whether to have something old (especially the orange custard, I love it!) or try a new flavor. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ice cream!

Went there several times on a recent visit to Madison. (Had to go back just to make sure we didn't imagine how good it was.)

Sadly, it spoiled any other ice cream that we had for the remainder of the Wisconsin trip--the rest paled by comparison. 

Only drawback is finding parking."}
{"text":"Awesome ice cream at very reasonable prices. You can also see the dairy plant in the same building where the ice cream is made!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS.  The entire experience is so fun.  It's in one of their ag/food science buildings, completely connected/part of the university (hello, isn't that half the draw?), and absolutely delicious. You can watch the manufacturing process (just follow the signs down the hall/up the stairs).  The store sells all sorts of dairy products, etc other than just ice cream (and you can take the ice cream home for later, too!).  Such a fun experience. If you like ice cream and are going to be on campus, you've gotta come here."}
{"text":"Ice cream is yummy and while there you have to pick up some eggs - they are fresh, delicious and only $2.00 a dozen!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars if I could! 

I've been going to this place for decades and it is hands down the BEST ice cream. It's connected to the UW Madison Dairy Sciences department, which offers tours of ice cream making on occasion. All ice cream is made on site. They dream up new flavors, in honor of certain notables, and just for fun as well. 

Favorite flavors: Blue Moon (which is Smurf blue and tastes like Fruit Loops), a classic butter pecan and orange custard chocolate chip. Honestly, you cannot go wrong in this place. 

They also sell a nice selection of cheese and have a sandwich/soup bar off to the side."}
{"text":"Very decent ice cream. One of the best in Wisconsin. In a warm sunny day, it is a very good place to hanglut too. Yhey also have decent collection of sandwiches."}
{"text":"I don't like ice cream and will only eat Birite in San Francisco -- Babcocks breaks my rule! Wonderful history and viewing room upstairs. Ice cream was buttery goodness -- had butter pecan (nice hint of salt), Caramel swirl, Badger something with lots of chocolate and mandarin chocolate."}
{"text":"ARE YOU FUCKING READY FOR THE BEST ICE CREAM IN THE STATE? You bet you are. The only ice cream in the world that competes is Blue Bell, and I can't get that in WI. 

They have limited hours, so plan ahead and get a bucket for your freezer and a cone for now. 

I don't like some of their flavors, and some are to sweet, sample widely before buying."}
{"text":"orange custard and bitter sweet chocolate chips my lanta!

this is the best ice cream in town. 

also great here: fudge bottomed pie : )"}
{"text":"Good god...probably some of the best ice cream I have ever had. I ate way too much, but I would eat it all again in a heartbeat if I am in the area again. It is worth the trip out here."}
{"text":"The ice cream is terrific but the sandwiches and staff are so completely lackluster. First, on the staff. I recognize that most staff are hourly student workers, paid practically in peanuts. As an hourly student worker myself, I wonder if their lack of investment is either 1) general undergraduate failure to undertake any responsibility with enthusiasm and energy, or 2) the result of lack of incentive-based management policies. Maybe they can reward these kids for every sandwich they serve up, and that way they might smile while wanly handing you your lunch. Maybe. In any event, beyond the no-frills service, the sandwiches are so completely bland. Bad bread (in a city with good bread options), iceberg lettuce, no interesting sauces to speak of, bland cheeses, etc. In a pinch, the $5 deal IS indeed a deal: sandwich, Babcock milk, and a bag of chips. But the only reason to go there is lack of better lunch options in the immediate vicinity. I guess if you're trying to placate a kid with delicious dairy products, Babcock isn't so bad, but if you're an adult seeking meaningful sustenance, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Favorite ice cream shop thus far! Too bad it's all the way in Madison. Although that could be a good thing, since I already have addictions to enough sweet things. 
It's not fancy or colorful inside, but boy do you forget about that once you taste the ice cream. All employees are students and they're all awesome! Super friendly and eager to help, whether it's a question you have or you just want to sample literally every flavor they have :) they also showed us the milk plant in the back and gave us some background - pretty cool!
After sampling everything, I couldn't decide on one single flavor, so I ended up getting Key Lime Pie and Orange Chocolate Custard together - best decision ever hahaha those two are a must! 
They also sell pretty tasty cheese that was way cheaper than Wegmans here :)"}
{"text":"AH-MAZING ice cream to be found here, and a must stop for any ice cream lover! The Babcock Hall Dairy Store has been around for ages, and they know how to make great ice cream. It's super rich and creamy, and very flavorful. We stopped by during the afternoon lull on a Saturday afternoon, and there was no line at the time, but the store filled up quickly after we ordered. I sampled a couple of flavors before ordering, and got to try:

-Pineapple Cake (Cake Batter Ice Cream w/Pineapple Pieces): Yum, this was really good and had great pineapple flavor. I would have ordered this for sure if it went better with the coffee flavor I also wanted. However, still recommended! 
-Orange Custard Chocolate Chip (Creamy Orange Flavored Custard w/Chocolate Flakes): I'm not a huge fan of the orange and chocolate combination, so this wasn't my favorite. However, the ice cream itself was still nice and creamy.
-Regular (Mocha Macchiato [Coffee w/Swirls of Caramel & Dark Chocolate Flakes] & Badger Blast (Chocolate Ice Cream w/Fudge Swirls & Dark Chocolate Flakes, $2.99 + $0.85 Waffle Cone, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=UZoG0UbW-kfJkHiPZbY02A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): YUM- their waffle cones are also delicious, and very crispy and crunchy. I liked the badger blast a bit more than the mocha, but both were really good. Highly recommended!

If I lived in Madison I would definitely gain 10 pounds coming to Babcock for ice cream all the time, but it would be worth it! This would be my first stop if I come back to Madison. Parking wasn't bad since they have a small lot right next to the store, but if all those spots are taken you'll have to park a bit further away since you can't park on the main street in front."}
{"text":"ON FRICKIN WISCONSIN.  Is it strange that this is one of the first places that I brag about when talking about my alma mater??  Please say no.  While I have never eaten any \"food\" here, the ice cream is insane and well worth the visit.  Its crowded no matter what season it is and the flavors do rotate out.  While its not inexpensive, I always grin and bear it.  The staff of mostly students is super friendly and accommodating- even when your toddler tries to make off with some low-hanging pretzels."}
{"text":"I forget how I found this place--one of them 72-hour guides to college towns, perhaps--but it was a choice selection. Here's the history lesson: dude named Babcock created the first ever dairy college at U-Dub. Years later, they name the building after him, and open up this retail ice cream establishment to make more money for the man.

Luckily, their ice cream is good.

We arrived just before Semisonic (err, closing time) at a ridiculous 4pm. Apparently other people had the same idea. The wife and I each got a flavor, a single (which apparently means two scoops). I did the butter pecan on cake cone, which I'm a complete sucker for--the cake cone, not the butter pecan. It had just been a long while since I'd had butter pecan. The wife got the mint on waffle cone, which costs a little bit more. But it doesn't matter because the prices are so dirt cheap to begin with, anyway.

Ice cream when it's 25 degrees out doesn't sound like a good idea, but Babcock Hall's good stuff hit the right spot. It's ridiculously creamy, which I suppose was to be expected, this being dairyland after all. I prefer my ice cream on the lighter side--think gelato or Paris' great Berthillon. Then again, I'm a huge sucker for Blue Bell's amazingly good and amazingly creamy chocolate chip cookie dough. Long story short, if you're getting ice cream, it's a nice story to get it from Babcock Hall while car touring campus. Pretty good stuff, too."}
{"text":"Deliciousness all up in this place!

I had the ice cream and I love the fact that I could get a single cone, but with two flavors. I had mocha macchiato and Union Utopia! HEAVENLY flavors! I am not sure how these students/staff don't gain 100 pounds with this place here!

There is something about this ice cream that can't be matched by other ice cream. The balance of creaminess and flavors, both subtle and bold in the right ways! Amazing!

MUST STOP if you are in the area - street parking can be tough. Walk to it if you can."}
{"text":"Fantastic ice cream on a lovely university campus. It does get busy though and not a lot of space to sit so be prepared to take your ice cream to go."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself on the University of Wisconsin campus at Madison, forget whatever it is that you are there to do and go directly to the dairy store. U of W ice cream is the real deal - rich, creamy, and churned to smooth perfection. They whip up a variety of flavors that are sure to please every palate from traditional vanilla and chocolate to slightly more exotic concoctions like Pumpkin Cream Pie and Blue Moon - a bright blue, berry ice cream. I had the Union Utopia with swirls of peanut butter, caramel, and fudge. If you're staying awhile or live in the area, stock up on pints or quarts for your own freezer. You can even pick up a three gallon tub for large events."}
{"text":"Hard to beat high quality dairy product from the dairy state in the heart of the campus that helped put the dairy state on the map.

Excellent ice cream is a given.  Be sure to try some of the cheese like the aged cheddar and the sandwiches if you are there at lunch.  Definitely a must if you are visiting the campus."}
{"text":"Alot has changed to the store since I went to school some 20+ years ago (don't judge!) but one thing has stayed the same, their ice cream is a Madison classic.  Yes, Babcock struggles to compete with the super premium ice creams that are now on the market, but the Chocolate Peanut Butter ice cream will always bring me back to a hot night in the dorms where I would gorge myself on an entire pint of it.  There flavors have expanded since then but there has never been a flavor I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good ice cream. Had a homemade, milky quality you rarely find anymore. The serving sizes are very generous ($3 gets you a good sized bowl with 3 scoops and you can double that for $5.)

We tried four kinds and loved them all!"}
{"text":"A definite must-try if you're visiting the college campus. They make their own ice cream and it's delectable - I had the chocolate flavor on a waffle cone, and it was a very very satisfying experience :)"}
{"text":"Easy A+ ice cream. Incredible texture with dairy quality unknown to most of the world. Huge array of flavors. We picked four different ones to sample as double scoops into a cup. Huge servings. There are some pre-packaged tubs for takeaway as well. Big variety of cones and sundaes I'm sure, but I'm here for unadulterated ice cream."}
{"text":"Everything is great except that you will pay an arm and a leg for ice cream. I highly recommend their product just be prepared to pay for what you get."}
{"text":"Everyone on campus knows it's the best- creamy, quality ice cream. All the flavors are great, but I personally enjoy key lime pie and badger blast the best. The service is wonderful, and you get your order fast. There is indoor and outdoor seating, both very nice and a good atmosphere to them."}
{"text":"Came home for Summer vacation!! We are alumni of the UW!!! The ice cream was delicious, so many more flavors than back in the 80's...yum!!!  Now great memories continue with our family and this wonderful ice cream and cheese stop!!!"}
{"text":"It's an experience. It's not exactly close to other stuff since it's just the food science building, but worth it. You're probably here for the ice cream, and they're generous with the portions. They've got a couple seasonal/rotating flavors in addition to the classics. You can also buy pints and larger here (only a couple grocery stores carry them - Metcalfe's and Woodman's I think). They do also have cheese, for what it's worth. While you're eating your ice cream (or sherbet as it may be), you can follow the cow prints to the observation deck to watch them making cheese and ice cream (weekdays only). If you don't get a chance to check out the many cheese factories in southern Wisconsin, you can get a glimpse here."}
{"text":"Went here for cheese - thrilled with the stash!!!  We got brick cheese and farmer's cheese- prices were very reasonable and the cheese was delicious!  Given the good value, I was able to bring back cheese for my friends.  It was so good that it all got eaten.  I am now out of cheese again... :("}
{"text":"A lot of people come here for the ice cream, but a little known fact is they also have delicious hot sandwiches at dirt cheap prices. They aren't stingy with the meat and cheese either. My favorite sandwich is the Mendota Club ($4.30), which has turkey, monterey jack with chives, lettuce, tomato, mayo and guacamole on your choice of bread. It's delicious toasted. They also have soups and wraps. Not to mention they sell pints and gallons of the ice cream they make as well as pre-packaged bricks of cheese, gallons of milk and half and half, and a limited selection of deli meats and sausages. My new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place is a total gem. So a little context for the place, it's connected to the food science department and it's not a real restaurant. It's closer to a cafe with a couple of tables inside and a couple of tables outside. Would definitely recommend getting your food to go. The food is absolutely delicious! When I went, I got a sandwich and chocolate milk. Both were absolutely delicious and SUPER CHEAP! I would definitely check this place out if you're in the neighborhood.

I haven't had the ice cream....yet! But based on my friends' reviews it's absolutely delicious! I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"For years my husband has raved about how fantastic the ice cream is at this place so I finally go the chance to go.  Honestly I was not expecting a whole lot since my husband is an ice cream fanatic so with that being said any ice cream is fantastic to him as long as its dairy and cold he loves!  So we shared a turtle sundae and I was blown away by how creamy and delicious the ice cream truly was.  I am not a huge ice cream fan so I tend to be a little pickier but this stuff was good!  To be honest I thought the hot fudge and caramel on it did not justice would have rather just had the ice cream because of how flavorful it was and cheap!  I would recommend their ice cream to anyone visiting Madison!!!"}
{"text":"My sister who went to school here has raved about this place forever.  I finally made it a point to get here, the sandwiches are so-so, I dont think I'd bother with them again.  The wife and I both hand the club.  Still;  lets not pretend who the star of the show is here, the ice cream is beyond belief.  So rich and velvety smooth, some of the best I've ever had.  Not crazy about the extra .85 cent charge just to get a waffle cone though.  I think that's something that should come standard with ice cream cones.  Regardless, I'll absolutely come back the next time I get the chance."}
{"text":"I couldn't choose just one of the 30+ flavors so I tried 3 in a 3-4scoop size for just $3. I had the badger blast, utopia, and some chunky chocolate kind. So yummy! And creamy! Just what I was looking for on this hot day!"}
{"text":"PRODUCT: \"A+\". The ice cream is outstanding; a testament to Wisconsin dairy people and products.

STORE: \"C-\". Learn about the different ice cream types before you go, because there's no printed info about them on-site.

Review the flavors, too; and keep the browser open in your phone. The only way to identify the flavors yourself on-site is to peer at a digital sign, which lists as few as 3 at a time. Unlike most ice cream shops, you can't see the tubs; or even a chalkboard or menu listing all the flavors.

But you can read about Babcock, see charts pertaining to U.S. milk production, see a poster on cheeses, and view the workshop.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: \"D\". Our sullen server (\"L---\") never smiled, welcomed us, or volunteered info. When asked to list the super premium flavors, he replied 'You can see the sign'. Luckily, he wandered off mid-transaction, then two cheerful girls helped.

PARKING: \"F\". The far side of the street outside has no indication that parking's prohibited (e.g., a sign or red curb). Yet university police will ticket you, never mind your out-of-state plates. We got ours courtesy of Officer 57, who took pleasure in giving the citation.

OVERALL GRADE: \"B-\". Some other schools catering to the public are Cornell's hotel school, and the Culinary Institute of America (Poughkeepsie and St. Helena campuses). They're wonderful all around. (The U.S. Military Academy's hotel seemed so too, from a brief encounter once at West Point.)

Compared to them, at least on today's exam, UW-Madison falls short."}
{"text":"So many different ice cream choices. The sherbets tend to be extremely, extremely creamy."}
{"text":"I think the dairy store offers excellent ice cream that will greatly appeal to most people. They have very approachable flavors, so I think it'd be easy for anyone to find something they like.

But for me, the ice cream was just too rich and creamy (again, I'm sure factors that ice-cream lovers will enjoy), and the flavors were not inventive or tremendously robust. I think the ice cream is top-notch but don't feel that the \"mix-ins\" seem to live up to that standard. On the other hand, why is the pumpkin flavor sullied with \"mashmallow creme\"?! Maybe I would prefer the totally straightforward, classic flavors here. And according to their website they offer frozen yogurt, which oddly enough I prefer. Well, I guess I should give it another shot."}
{"text":"Best ice cream anywhere, period. Get some and experience what generations already know."}
{"text":"The dairy store has pretty good ice cream (although, given their access to fresh dairy, it could be even better) and it is dirt cheap. No need to get anything larger than a mini, because that size is more than most adults can handle. People here are friendly, too. All said, a fun campus diversion."}
{"text":"You can always count on Babcock to not have a full inventory. Every taco salad week there's at least one component missing. I wish I could say that this is only true for the end of the week, but alas this place surprised me again. Need tortilla chips for your taco salad? We ran out of it the first day. 

The only reason I give this place 3 stars is because the ice cream is good. I go here because it's convenient. I wish my job was closer to state street though. 

In short, it's good for a snack or dessert but pretty bad for a meal. Disappointing.

Edit: 12/7/2015
A friend suggested I edit every time Babcock doesn't have something so here we go. These are not just my accounts but also from friends that go there. We're in Day 1 of Taco Salad week at 1:30pm and they've run out of Meat Chili, Taco meat and Veggie Chili. Classic. I'm actually becoming impressed with their incompetency."}
{"text":"The creamiest ice cream in town!!!  So good and so playful! I had the blue moon and salted caramel toffee and hubby has the badger blast. Both are rich, tasty and creamy!  I wished they sell them here in nyc... yummy!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, as a visitor that adores your frozen custard, it's crazy for me to think anyone would want ice cream. But I suppose there's room enough in this dairy state for both. 

My sister introduced me to Babcock several years ago. She said that the ice cream, plus sitting in the Union overlooking to lake would be the perfect way to end my first trip to Madison. And maybe that's what makes this ice cream so special-the scenery, the view, and the people. 

Babcock ice cream is amazingly creamy and super cheap. There's plenty of flavors to choose from, it's no Baskin Robbins selection, but who needs quantity when there's quality?

My favorites are tied for gold. Blue Moon, which is a bright blue berry flavored ice cream. No relation to Blue Moon Beer, which kind of disappointed me at first. But not to worry, your taste buds will be more than satisfied, if albeit a tad blue. The Orange Custard Chocolate Chip is also to die for. I've been dying to try the Caramel Apple, but unfortunately I'm 2000 miles away. But you can bet, as soon as I step foot off my plane at MSN I'll be headed to the Babcock's at the Union."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"can't miss spots\" in Madison!

Daily products produced on premises.....milk, butter, cheese and ice cream. 

Ice cream is the true star of Babcock Dairy!! Soooo many delicious flavor choices..... Try more than one!

There's also a sandwich and breakfast counter, so you can enjoy a meal with your  ice cream.

Like most ice cream parlors, getting a scoop or two isn't exactly cheap, but you're paying for the experience, so go for it.

Load up on Babcock ice cream for your home freezer, as it's somewhat rare outside Madison! Just fyi.

I tried the Union Utopia: vanilla ice cream with ribbons of peanut butter and chocolate.... Excellent!!"}
{"text":"OMG IT'S CREAMY.

And this location is the actual site of the Dairy Plant soooo it's even more creamy. Hot from the udders...



Babcock Flavors I've tried:

Pumpkin Pie - unfortunately seasonal :( because this stuff is insane. FOREVER AND ALWAYS my favorite.

Chocolate - slaps you silly with its creamy, butterfatty richness.

Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough - want a cookie? want ice cream? you get both. yay.

Praline Pecan - more sugary/caramely taste to it compared to the butter pecan.

Mocha Macchiato - coffee, caramel, dark chocolate - mmhm. 

Cookies & Cream - I want Oreos and milk but am too lazy to dunk, Babcock gotcha back.

Orange Custard Chocolate Chip - very popular, but I don't like it. Too fruity :p

Chocolate Turtle - chocolate ice cream, caramel, pecans. yep.

Badger Blast - chocolate lovers rejoice.

Chocolate Peanut Butter - I typically prefer peanut butter & chocolate to be kept separate BUT this stuff is amazing. second favorite to the pumpkin pie.

Butter Pecan - more buttery than the praline...really. it's great.

Peppermint Stick - cravin that candy cane taste in your dairy?? get this guy.



You need to experience the love that is Babcock Ice Cream. 
Thank you."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today for some lunch followed by ice cream! I got the bulky badger sandwich, which is superrrrrr delicious. I loved it. Flavors were really good and there were a ton of toppings, 10/10.

I also got the chocolate turtle ice cream which was also delicious! Prices here aren't horrible for the good taste and quality. Can get a little crowded and busy depending on the time, but they seem to handle the rush pretty well. I would love to stop by here again the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"Tried the vanilla and it was outstanding, unadulterated creamy richness with the hint of vanilla. Kudos to the badgers, the food production staff are learning a valuable skill and producing a teriffic product."}
{"text":"I can't think of a more iconic Madison spot.  This lovely place highlights all the wonders of Madison including our dairy production, wonderful University and passion for good food!  The best ice cream in town, lots of fun flavors, all reasonably priced!  TIP, they even sell ice cream mix that you can take home and make!"}
{"text":"Babcock ice cream. Yum! Madision has yet to disappoint me with any of their dairy and  this place isn't an exception. I ordered the peanut butter chocolate ice cream. It was creamy and delicious. I can't say I've had peanut butter flavored ice cream before (I need to find something like this in Los Angeles). Grab a scoop of ice cream and enjoy a stroll down the Union Terrace where many students and other locals come hang out by the water."}
{"text":"Love this place -- probably responsible for many of my trips to Madison as the freshness is amazing, flavors are well balanced, and prices are unbelievable. Scoops here are enormous so beware before ordering enough ice cream for a full brain freeze. If you're coming from far away, you'll want to sample several favors to get the full experience of different flavor profiles. No matter what you order though, the creaminess and freshness of the milk really come out and the flavors are very distinct from one another. 

Definitely worth a special trip if you live in the midwest. The flavors aren't as fancy as what you'd find in Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams, but the freshness and simplicity will delight your palate just the same."}
