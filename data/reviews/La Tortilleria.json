{"text":"Really good traditional Mexican fare. Very no frills, but exactly like in Mexico. Cute grocery store inside. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"We love coming here to pick up our corn tortillas and chips (for cooking at home) which are made fresh on site.  The chips even keep and taste great up to a few weeks later.  We haven't tried eating in/take-out from here, but based on the comments, I don't think we're missing much.  One of the hidden gems in Kensington."}
{"text":"I just moved back to Toronto after living in Mexico CIty for 5 years, and this is the most authentic Mexican place I've found in the city so far. The tortillas are just as good as in Mexico, the totopos (chips), tostadas, and fresh salsas are also on par with what I would get down there.   For true taco connaisseurs, these are \"tacos de guisado\" which means they put rice, beans, and a \"guisado\" or \"main dish\" in each taco. They have chicken tinga, chicken mole, potato with chorizo, chile relleno (stuffed pepper), and a couple vegetarian options which I can't remember. My only complaint about the food is that I wish the chile relleno were filled with cheese rather than potato but it's good nonetheless.   The service is a bit slow as there is often only one person working but it gives me time to look at the small selection of Mexican products they sell and pick up some stuff to bring home. The price is reasonable but still makes me long for the prices I used to pay in Mexico. I have been there several times, and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decided I wanted to bake my own nachos, so I came and bought their chips and their fresh green salsa.  Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered a beef and chicken mole.    Generous amount of meat inside but the chicken mole was disgusting.  I normally like mole but this was just the wrong mix of chocolate and chicken.  Too sickly sweet and not enough spice to balance it.  It was pretty bad.  Beef one was fine but nothing special, even a little dry.    I don't know about the corn tortilla.  I know some people like it.  I think the texture is a little dry but that's just me."}
{"text":"The food here was not bad, the only complaint would be it was understaffed and probably the reason it closed down. There was only one employee and it took the cashier/cook from start to finish probably 10-15 minutes to fulfill two burrito orders. I cant imagine what it must have been like on a school lunch day (high school across)."}
{"text":"Disgusting place to eat, costumer service is the worse, went with my friends to have some tacos and in all 3 orders we found hair,  I brought it to their attention and they just said thanks for coming and didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place , I'm a big taco fan and the place comes across as authentic but the tacos come out as a little dry. Tortilla chips are good I have purchased the taco shells for home and made my own (turned out good). They could be more attentive in the dining room, tables and floors are sometimes dirty ."}
{"text":"Nice location, food comes in large portions, and you really get your money's worth. Kind staff and very giving, we were the last table in the restaurant and they stayed open for us. The store is quite small, it appears to be just starting up. They have a huge menu, and chipotle-esque choices. It has more options than chipotle, actually. They ran out of a few options, and offered other choices for no extra charge. The pork carnitas I had was large, the first bite was a mouthful of rice, which was not the most pleasant texture, and the pork was extremely dry. The tortillas that come with the meal weren't bad. Would probably go again for a burrito if I'm feeling like one and do not feel like going far. A very filling meal. Wouldn't order what I ordered again, however."}
{"text":"For homemade tortillas, sauces and a variety of Mexican ingredients that are harder to find, this place is great and very well priced!! Customer service was friendly and helpful.   However do not go here for the food. Ordered a chicken and pulled pork taco along with a burrito. All three dishes were bland and had zero flavour. The pulled pork was extremely dry and tasted as if it was only roasted in its own juices (no spice). I would definitely not eat here again (you're better off going to Burrito Boys for a delicious burrito!)"}
{"text":"came here once on a really hot summer day. you'll probably hear people freak out about this place because their tortillas are homemade and dope. the innards are also good, authentic but somehow not up to par with the tortilla. it was my first time trying mole, damn it was good. nice little front patio, would definitely hit this place instead of big fat next time I'm in kensy."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst tacos I have eaten in my life.  Meat seemed reheated, tacos appeared microwaved.  Very bland. Very disappointing.  $5 for nachos with a thimble of guacamole and salsa is a rip off too!  I will not be back in the foreseeable future!"}
{"text":"The chicken mole taco was great, and also huge. I wish I'd just gotten that. Carnitas were solid but a bit dry, and the beef chipotle taco was awful. As others have written here, it's a pile of dry, flavourless ground beef with some tomatoes on top. Not sure why they call it \"chipotle,\" or really anything for that matter. I'd give them four stars easily if it wasn't for that thing.   But overall, this place is better than people seem to give it credit for. The tortillas are good, the service was very friendly, the salsa is tasty, and at least 1/3 of my tacos was worth going back for."}
{"text":"Finally, not Taco Bell!  Had it to go.  I appreciate it when they do a decent job packing my food to go and are environmentally friendly (ie. No styrofoam!).  We had the tacos, that came in 3s with a side of nacho chips.  The quesadilla was more like a roundly wrapped burrito and I like how they inserted a hard taco inside/nacho chip like, so it provided a great crunch.  They also sell Mexican grocery items, like cheese, salsas, organic nacho chips.  Will return to try other items and dine-in."}
{"text":"Right place to get Mexican products. I just didn't like the fact that their products, some of them  are already expired, even when my girlfriend and I asked the employee about the expiring date of the cookies that we were about to purchase, the employee afirm that, it was the make date, we trusted her; by the time we tried the cookies at home, the taste wasn't what we expected, those were so expired like cucarachas bien muertas. canned beans are more expensive here than in the mexican section at the nofrills @ duff mall. And they're always short on change it's like ttc experience only acept exact fare. The taste of the tortilla it's nothing out of this world, Maseca taste like flavour. We could do better paisanos . Si se puede!!"}
{"text":"I was not completely thrilled with my tacos. I ordered the campechanos (grilled steak) and was underwhelmed by the lack of flavour in general. Seemed more like chunks of dry meat on a tortilla. I had to add some diced tomatoes of my own and pour over the sauce it comes with.   On a positive note, the sauces are great."}
{"text":"As a Mexican, having a Mexican place to eat close to me sounded fantastic. I had been to previous locations and previous years and this place is getting more and more white every year. The food is now bland and seems to sit there forever. There's no aguas frescas and I could almost be sure none of the staff knows more than 3 words in Spanish.  I am sad to see of my favourite places turn into an average, tasteless, pseudo-mexican place."}
{"text":"If I could give them less than one star for a review I would. I went in there for dinner tonight with my wife, my sister and her mother in law. Bought us all dinner including a few things to bring home with us so I spent about $120.00. My sisters tacos came as plain as can be so I asked for a small side dish or container of just beans. I was told they couldn't do it what so ever no way in hell. The only way they could do it is if I bought a bean taco with nothing else on it. So for argument sake I did and they charged me $5.00 for nothing but beans on a tortilla she'll. I took the beans the left the tortillas behind. That is the most horrifying customer service experience I have ever had. The mere fact that they couldn't possibly provide a side dish of beans and had to sell me a plain bean taco is very sad. I had just moved into the area and had been there a few times and thought it was the best place ever is no longer so. Horrible customer service, no customer appreciation and hate the \" I don't give a shit\" attitude from their \" assistant manager\" Luis if you get this message I will be calling your head office regarding this dispicable shit hole you call a business that you aw running."}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetarian burrito, they messed it up while making it and put it back together hastily, they didn't warm it up properly. The taste was mediocre/bland there was very little flavour compared to typical veggie burritos. People seem to go there to just buy packs of pre-made plain tortillas. Their actual food is probably not what the restaurant's known for Will never go back there, waste of $10."}
{"text":"I visit often to buy the tortillas to take home which are very fresh and delicious. There are a lot of places to choose from in Kensington for Mexican food and La Tortilleria is definitely one of my favorites. There are 2 picnic tables at the outdoor patio whee you can take your food to eat. We got drinks from \"Wrestlers\" which shares the building - maybe same owners? The piña coladas were so sweet that I had to get extra lime and water. Too sweet for me and inconsistent between the different drinks, which is strange because it comes from a frozen drink machine... But the tacos were delicious and generous with the fillings."}
{"text":"I thought that Toronto had no real Mexicans but I spotted three amigos here! I first went into La Tortilleria lured by its sign for \"fresh tortillas\" and, in addition to the proprietor and staff who are from south of the \"other\" border, I found a divey little grocery store crammed full of Mexican delights like corn husks for tamales, chicharrones, packaged chorizo, chipotle in adobo, tamarind pods and dried chiles sold by weight.  I bought half a kilo of their tortillas for $1.75 (a full kilo is $3). They were just made and still warm, smelling of steamed corn. I tried samples of their homemade salsas (red, green, and brown; all hot) and chose the green one for its bracing tartness and slow-burning heat. They also make their own tortilla chips which are so crispy, fresh, and addictive, I have sworn off supermarket-brand tortilla chips.   I recently went back to try their cochinita pibil taco; shredded pork that's been slow roasted in a tomato-based sauce. It comes on two of their homemade tortillas layered with black bean puree and rice. Their homemade salsas are free for topping.  It's a skimpy portion and I'm not sure if it's meant to be that way or if the owners are trying to cut costs; still, it was pretty darned delicious. The prices are $2.50 for one, $6.49 for 3, and $8.49 for 4. I suggest sitting at the little tables they've set up to eat because the tacos are saucy and messy, and don't look like they'd travel well.   They also serve horchata ($1.50) which is made from scratch by another restaurant. Not the best I've had but much better than the stuff from concentrate. They do not skimp on the Mexican cinnamon!  I've tentatively planned a non-sexual date with Sarah \"taco-shaped hole in her heart\" L. so I can go back and try the four other fillings: chiles rellenos, spinach, steak, and chicken. And, of course, get more of their tortilla chips and salsa. Consider me hooked!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. When you walk in you are greeted by 2 young boys (who look about 12 years old) and who stare at you as if to say, \"What are you doing here?\".  Then it goes downhill from here. The food, service, and general ambience is hideous.  The prices for this crap are out of sight. You're much better off at a Taco Bell. (And it's somewhere neat the bottom as well, but at least you don't get screwed on the bill.)  Stay away!"}
{"text":"I work around the corner and was SO EXCITED when they did the renovations on this place! I ordered the Ensalada Mexicana (a friend had it before and said it was great) but when it arrived, it was dressingless. So I asked for a dressing (my friends' had come on the side) and they said it was already on it. I have eyes and saw that clearly there wasn't any, so ask for one on the side, add some directly on it, ANYTHING. No, they don't do that and the dressing must be hidden under the toppings (but wait, didn't you just make this? How do you not know?)  I did not enjoy my $11 dry pieces of spinach. This upsets me so much because I had so much hope for a new lunch pace so close to my work :( Was not aware of a dressing shortage or rationing happening so please keep this in mind people.  On the bright side, they do have the real Coca-Cola in the bottle and apparently their burritos are pretty good."}
{"text":"When I came back to TO from LA (ie. northern Mexico), I scoured the city for a fresh corn tortilla, but all I could find were bland supermarket flour tortillas. I finally found some mass produced corn tortillas in Kensington, but they still lacked flavour, they were dry, and the texture was just off. I finally found Tortilleria and their fresh tortillas were better than the ones I had remembered on the streets of Tijuana... and they're CHEAP! Now I come here every few weeks to pick up a 1/2 kilo of their corn tortillas and tortilla chips. To prevent them from drying out after a couple of days, throw your unused tortillas into the freezer and they'll keep much longer!"}
{"text":"This place was a lot better before it was remodeled to focus more on fast food and take out.  I used to do a lot of my grocery shopping here for Mexican goods but I find every time I go they are out of much of the things I need and don't get restocked and they never have any tortillas aside from white.  I used to go out of my way to go to this location, but will definitely be trying a different location (kensington, maybe) or a different store entirely.    The take out food is good though, however, I am giving it 2 stars as a grocer.  If I could rate the take out/eat independently... 4 stars for sure."}
{"text":"We came in at 12:30pm today, a Saturday. There was no line so our order was taken quickly. We should've clued in earlier as no seated guest was actually eating a taco...35 minutes later our order still wasn't ready and we asked for a refund and left. They apologized and said they were short-staffed. I can't really comment on the food since we didn't actually get to taste any but how can they run a business like this?"}
{"text":"Worst burrito I've ever had in my entire life. It was like all salad and cold cheese for the first 10 bites, then one bite of sloppy guac, then flavorless meat chunks. You're honestly better off going to get a roti at jerk king. The woman was nice though. Also terrible Lay out and use of space. I felt like I was eating in a prison cafeteria."}
{"text":"Now THIS is authentic!   As soon as I saw the sign for Bimbo bread on the door, I knew I was in for a delicious Mexican treat. This is the sort of place that makes me feel like I can have international adventures right here in Toronto. It makes me slightly uncomfortable to not know what to expect or how to order things, but once I man up and do it... Boy am I pleased with myself!  The shelves are stocked with Mexican grocery stuff - spices, peppers, and hot sauce, but also snack cakes, hot chocolate mix, and noodles, all Mexican brands. And the 'decor', such as it is, makes a person feel like they're wandering around a grocery in Mexico - no huge attention paid to fancy shelving or staging, just yellow metal shelves stuffed with products.   There's a couple of tables in one corner, covered in plastic table cloths, just waiting for someone to drool taco innards on them. I appreciate the sentiment, but took my tacos away to eat in a park.  Speaking of the tacos... The tacos! Are amazing! Delicious soft corn shells, made in house, and as authentic as they come. I ordered three for 6$ and change - two chicken mole (the mole was rich and complex, not over salty, the chicken was shredded a la taco stand on a Mexican street) and one squash (zucchini) and corn (fresh, crisp). And served to me by a friendly Mexican fella, which upped the 'international adventure' factor.  My only complaint about this place is that I've lived in the neighbourhood for over a year and haven't been in until now."}
{"text":"Great find. The second time I moved here I moved from San Francisco and was having some serious Mexican withdrawal symptoms. I started making my own tortillas because I could only find junk in the stores. La Tortilleria is a tiny little storefront, about half of which is occupied by a tortilla machine (no \"a mano\", unfortunately, but I'm not complaining). It churns out fresh tortillas all day and they're priced so cheap I feel guilty not leaving more. They're something like 1.50 a pound, which is enough for a big dinner party. I've only had a few of the tacos the guys prepare on-site, but the pork pibil was the best of the lot. Generally I just buy the tortillas and chips and then make some carnitas at home. I'm so glad Toronto has this place and I hope they make it."}
{"text":"Very disappointing food. Very little flavor in the beef/pork taco option - absolutely nothing Mexican about it. Also very surprised to learn they had no fish on the menu!   Explains the sparsely populated dining hall with a street festival going on outside its doors. Friendly staff was a small positive."}
{"text":"La Tortilleria is a bit of a hybrid as it is definitely a restaurant but also sells their fresh tortillas, sauce and chips (as well as a small selection of other Mexican ingredients). Because of this I really think that a review of this place has to separately acknowledge each of these functions.   As a taco joint, this place is solid but not the best in Toronto (El Trompo is better). The tacos are flavourful (if not quite 100% authentic), sauces have good kick, and they have some things that the other places don't (like mole).   As a place to get fresh tortillas, salsas and sauces, and chips, this place can't be beat in Toronto (although for a wider selection of Mexican grocery items you need to go to Perola's across the street).   If you get a pack of the tortillas you will find the paper bundle they put them in will be soaked through with condensation by the time you get home which is a testament to how freshly pressed they are. Like all corn tortillas however you are on the clock when you get home, as within 12-24 hours these puppies will start to get all rubbery.   Another great thing to buy from here is the mole starter, which is basically a brown tarry ball of concentrated mole. All you have to do is heat up the starter with some water or stock and you have instant quality mole. This is apparently a very popular item in Mexico and having prepared mole from scratch before (which takes forever) I can see why.   In short, as a place to eat this is worth stopping by if you want to mix-it up once in a while in between El Trompo visits, but is definitely a must do if you're looking to  grab some tortillas, chips, sauces etc. to  use at home."}
{"text":"This is just a review of the tacos & dining--not the groceries, which looked wonderful.  Went here with a friend a couple weeks ago to try the tacos. Three for $6 and change. I got the mole, steak, and squash. The mole was the best one, with the squash coming in second. All of them were delicious, but could have been improved with salsa, which was nowhere to be seen. There was a chip bowl that looked to have once been full of nachos, but no dice. There was only one employee, who looked to be a kid of about thirteen. He was stretched pretty thin.  I think this place is probably pretty good if you happen to get there when they're on the ball, but we didn't. Would've loved some salsa and chips with the tacos. It's probably a lot nicer to hang in there in the summertime.   Also, the Mexican Coca-Cola was overly sweet. Not my bag."}
{"text":"I have read many reviews on this place and I now live in the neighborhood, so I stopped in last weekend to pick up some fresh tortillas.  It was just as others had described, I got a 1/2 kilo for $1.75...amazing!  I think this will be great for the summer when I have bbq's, will def pick up a full kilo to do some soft tacos & fajitas.  I didn't try any of the tacos they they sold there (as I was going home to make my own fajitas with the tortillas I just bought) but I did pick up a can of refried beans for $1.29 (all the prices seem cheaper than your local grocery store).  I also liked that they had a huge selection of hot sauce.    Overall, the people working there were very nice, and I will def be back again."}
{"text":"It seems that this place has been opened for almost a year now, and I finally decided to check out the place. I have seen it on Google Maps, but never had the \"urge\" to try it out, until tonight.   I arrived around 1 hour before closing, and noticed that it was empty. Perhaps the mediocre reviews that this location got, could reflect the place being empty? Or perhaps its just \"cold\" out? Who knows. I entered the restaurant from the back entrance, and went to place my order. I noticed that there was only one employee there. The employee apologized as he/she was watching the sports game on their phone, and I said its okay.   I glanced through their menu, and the employee asked what I would like. I told him that I would want a veggie burrito. He said no problem, and then proceeded to ask what I would like in it. I told him I would like to try the habanero tortilla, the soy chorizo and the regular fillings. I asked if they had pico de gallo and they did not. While he started to make the burrito, I took a glance at the restaurant. It was well organized, clean and neat. The displays for the various nachos, tortillas, etc. were displayed properly.   When the employee was making the burrito, I was observing, as I normally do at any burrito place, and he wore gloves (yes I look at that too, as one burrito place, they didn't). Overall it took him around 5 to 10 minutes or so, to prepare the entire thing. This I think is normal, as the other burrito places I've been to, they take the same amount of time. However, the times I've gone to the other places, they've been semi to extremely busy. So I assume that since no one else was in the restaurant, he decided to take a little bit of extra time. I thought I could use it to my advantage, as the taste will be great - but lo and behold it wasn't. Dun dun dun.....  INTERMISSION ----------------------------  WE NOW BRING YOU BACK TO THE YELP REVIEW  Ah so let me continue. He placed the burrito in a plate, with nachos and salsa. I proceed to sit down and inspect my food before I take a bite out of anything. Yes its a habit of mine. I just don't dive right into the food heh. Looking at the nachos, they did not seem fresh, and so I decided to take a bite out of it. It was neither crunchy nor soft. It was in the middle. They were cold, which was fine, and the salsa was cold, straight out of the fridge. I guess some don't mind this, but I don't like too cold of a salsa. I then took a bite out of the burrito, and it had this weird taste - as though one of the ingredients was rotten. Something wasn't right about it, as even now after more than an hour - my stomach is still hurting. I've had soy chorizo elsewhere, so that can't be it. Any how, let me get back to it. Part of the burrito was cold, and the other was hot. The ingredients were not flavourful, and it wasn't satisfying. I guess taking the extra time to prepare/cook the ingredients and such, didn't pay off huh? I was this close to just leaving the rest, but I told myself, it is my hard earned money. Yes $8.99 + taxes is my hard earned money, and seeing it go to waste, makes me upset. So I opted to finish the whole thing.   In conclusion, I don't think I'll be coming back to this place, or if I do, I guess I will go when its busier, and see if the quality changes then. I have been to other burrito chain joints (not including Taco Bell EEEEWWWW) such as Mucho Burrito, Burrito Boyz and Gourmet Gringos. Those places have excellent tasting burritos, and I always go there again whenever I can. They are more packed even before closing time, so that tells you something.   I've yet to complete my quest to find the ultimate tasting burrito in the GTA, and I shall go visit Hermanos Mexican Grill in Port Credit Mississauga.  Well hopefully I won't get the trots (sorry to have brought it up), but until then I bid adieu."}
{"text":"The el de Carnitas tacos are amazing! So good! The guacamole dip is so fresh and smooth, must check this place out."}
{"text":"I got the 3 tacos for $10 and the Burrito for myself and my wife. It didnt make sense to me that I couldn't mix and match the different tacos that they had. I mean, for the premium prices I thought it was farfetched. Also the burrito (the steak and chorizo) that was $11 for a small portion. When I bit into it, it was 80% bread. They must have wrapped that thing like 8 times before serving it to me. The meat was hard and chewy and and seemed like it must've been doused in salt to hide how long it sitting out for. long story short, after a long days work, we ended up throwing it out and getting food else where. very displeased."}
{"text":"I feel bad about this 1 star. I wanted to give zero but that's not possible!   First, the location is borderline sketchy. Then the place is only borderline clean. But the food - it's so wrong in so many ways!   We had some sort of beef soft taco that was sooooo salty our tongues hurt after. The chicken salad/nacho was drenched in guac and sour cream it got so soggy it looked too gross to eat. We did anyway (we paid for it after all) and regretted it immediately. Like the beef, it was very salty, the ingredients didn't come together and it was just so, so very wrong.   So if you're craving for Mexican food, skip this one. There are boatloads of other places  you can go to."}
{"text":"Great place. Even had a chance to practice my Spanish, having a chance use the real Mexican word for tortilla chip (totopo), tortilla being Spanish for omelette.   Freshly made totopos were fabulous and they even had organic salsa. Very friendly atmosphere and wish I had not been in a hurry. I'll be back with my car to load up, but for those who are on the subway, it's about a 30 second walk from the Bloor-Dufferin entrance.  Definitely worth a look for anyone wanting to try something different, good, and authentic."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience we waited in line for over 20 minutes. Then when we made it to order we were told the credit card machine did not work and they would only accept exact change.  I asked why don't you post a sign starring you have cash issue. the cashier said the owner doesn't allow to post signs.  The place was dirty, the tables were not cleaned, and to top it all off rude and uncaring service"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!   The burritos are so full and bursting with flavour. Great food that doesn't break the bank ($8.95 for steak or chicken burritos).  With a place as good as this in the neighbourhood, only a cretin would go to Burrito Boys or Fat Bastard.  Friendly and helpful service.  Bonus for the fantastic Nacho chips samples.  10/10"}
{"text":"At last. An authentic taco joint in Richmond Hill that isn't Taco Bell or a Tex Mex joint. If only this place was open during my time at bayview secondary school, I would be here every day...its directly across it!   The staff is incredibly friendly and helped me with my food choice. He recommended the cactus tortilla (apparently it's really healthy) and I got three tacos with carnitas, chorizo, and carne enchilada. I had the works in it with a side of guacamole for an extra $1.99.   They included a few tortilla chips with your meal and those were excellent. The tacos taste authentic but as previous reviews noted, I wish the flavors were more intense. The salsa verde had barely any heat in it so I will be getting a hotter sauce next time. All in all, I will be returning if I need my Mexican fix since LA and Florida are too far to visit for lunch sometimes ;).   PS: they have bottled coke but not Mexican coke. Boo."}
{"text":"Mexican food is a hit or miss in Toronto, but in Kensington Market there is definitely no shortage of Mexican food, but are they any good?   La Tortilleria is known for their tortillas, but combine it with the fillings and it can make or break the whole taco experience.  We came here for lunch around noonish and the place was empty minus two staff members working. I thought at first, this cannot be good, but then thought perhaps we're just too early and it's a later lunch crowd.  As we browsed the menu, one friendly staff member helped explained their selection. I ordered the 4 tacos for $8.75 and had the top 4 selection as recommended by the staff member who was really friendly and patient while we ordered.  Good thing the place wasn't busy or else he may have been annoyed that we took so long to order.  While we waited for our names to be called we browsed at the many sauces and Mexican products available for purchase.  It didn't take too long for our orders to be ready (party of four) and by this time there was a slow trickle of customers coming in.  Presentation of the tacos looked nice,  but I wondered why didn't they use appropriate sized platters or perhaps they want the illusion that we were getting a lot of food.  My platter seemed a little bare with just a sprinkling of tortilla chips opposite of the tacos, plus I was missing my salsa.  No problem as my friend went to the counter to get  some for me since he was missing his as well.  The other two friends had their salsas.    Upon the first bite, I was definitely not impressed.  The fillings were not even warm, but because I was hungry I just ate it as is.  The meat fillings were not evenly distributed and the chicken pieces were clumped together. Not a problem as I just spread them out around the tortillas myself.    I managed to finished all 4 tacos, but didn't enjoy it because tacos were lacking in flavour and fact it wasn't even warm was disappointing. Thank goodness for the salsa to help with the flavouring.  Perhaps it was supposed to be served this way, but I couldn't be bothered to go to the counter and asked for my food to be heated up since I was hungry.  Definitely not the taco experience I was expecting, but at least we all gave it a chance. My friends didn't mind the cold tacos and thought it was tasty. I thought perhaps they were being polite, but I like my food warm and flavourful por favor.   Kudos to the guy at the counter for his friendly demeanor, but no credit to the cook who apparently didn't care about serving good Mexican food.  Perhaps next time, I'll just buy the tortillas and make my own tacos at home."}
{"text":"Not being from Toronto, I was pleasantly surprised to find a number of Mexican/Central American eateries a block away from Chinatown. I was in the mood for something Mexican and after wandering up and down Augusta Aveune, I wound up here.   I had the Taco Platter, which is four tacos for $7.25, which was a pretty good deal. I got 1 chicken, 1 pork and 2 beef. The offered a vegeatrian option, but I wanted meat, so I didn't try it. They were also stuffed with rice and veggies, then topped with sour cream drizzle and cilantro. I was able to add salsa at the condiment bar.   I got there about 7pm and the place was pretty empty, so I got my food right away.  The taco shells were crispy and falvourful, and the fillings nice. I wanted more sour cream and after asking, I got an extra side of it for free. That was fortunate, because the beef was pretty spicy and I needed it to take some of the heat off. Both the chicken and pork were closer to my comfort level (wimpy) and tasted great too.   I thought the shelves of Mexican food items were a nice touch too - if I lived there and wanted something exotic, this place has it.   All in all, this was a really good meal at a really good price. Based on some of the ther reviews here, this place may not sound as good as some of its nearby competitors, but this place seems to be more for those looking to slowly expand their palate and not totally change the way they eat Mexican food.   The only real knock I had on the place was the restroom, which was located in a dark basement and smelled like something had crawled in there and died."}
{"text":"1) mexican music playing on the speakers 2) real live mexicans working behind the counter 3) 3 soft tacos for $6 and change (8 types of meat/veg to choose from) 4) daily made nacho chips which are VERY good 5) fresh tortillas sold by the kilo and half kilo.... half a kilo was def. under 2 bucks.  It was a little grimy in there....but hey, it's mexican.  Great spot."}
{"text":"Un petit restaurant mexicain comme on les aime : pas cher, un bon choix de mets, une bonne dizaine de place assises en plus d'un coin épicerie pour acheter des produits mexicains. Près du carrefour de Dufferin et Bloor, c'est l'endroit idéal pour un petit casse-croûte relevé !"}
{"text":"An absolute disgrace to Mexican food and the mexican community. This is TexMex at best, but poorly executed. You can have better TexMex at Chipotle. The worst part is they advertise it as \"Authentic Mexican\" and it's far from the truth. If you want afordable, everyday  authentic Mexican go to Los Rebozos or Fonda Lola. If you want high-end authentic Mexican go to El Catrin or Los Colibries. This is a a shame, considering La Tortilleria sells authentic tortillas and their mexican sauces are excellent. Not sure what went wrong."}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant. Dropped by with some friends to check it out. Tacos tasted stale, chicken tasted like it was from a can. Disgusting and could not even finish one taco."}
{"text":"Very slow service and the order was still messed up. Tacos arrived cold and sent back only to come back cold again. Multiple customers ended up leaving rather than waiting 30 minutes to order 1 taco. All tables were dirty and customers had to clean their own area to sit down."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a fast Taco.  They are done well but sure could use a kick. So add your own spice. Great little store to grab your mexican supplies also. Don't forget to buy your Mexican coke it's the real deal."}
{"text":"A must visit when your near. Some great food also. Real Mexican store. Dont forget to buy a Coco its the real thing."}
{"text":"Auténtico? ¡Sí! Excelente? No.  In a city that is generally starved for credible Mexican, this place admirably assists in filling the cred void.  Everything in the shop is authentic right down to the help.    But when you get down to it, this is pretty much a Mexican convenience store...and part of a chain at that.  There's no abuelita churning the tortillas and salsa out - just good old commercial food prep.    The tortillas and salsa verde ARE fresh and tasty - definitely worth stopping in to try - just don't try to compare it to Agave Y Aguacate which features high quality food made properly by a proper chef."}
{"text":"I really like it here. I have eaten here twice, and taken home their (delicious, inexpensive) tortillas!  Both times I have been here were late in the evening, with only half an hour or so to close. The customer service was just wonderful both times. I would come back here just because of the very helpful staff, however, the food is excellent! I have tried a few items, and all were very fresh, well made, and delicious! Prices were very fair as well. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, great guac. Bonus: this is licensed, and has some Mexican shopping ingredients.  If you're looking for a simple and easy sit-down place near Dufferin and Bloor I highly recommend it.  They have free parking behind the place."}
{"text":"Well this restaurant was one of the best ones in this boring city.  I ordered 3 tacos combo , was surprised that these tacos go with fresh home made guacamole from the best Mexican avocados , a bunch of nacho chips , 2 salsas ( green one with cool onions and weed , and red bbq salsa ) I was really surprised that for this price ( 16$ ) I will get so many items !!!  There is also a market with latin food , It is not really my type of food , but as I notices there is always a line for the market products....  Well if you are into Mexican food and latin products this place one of the best ones in Kensington market."}
{"text":"I got their food through uber eats and although I love uber eats, I will never order from this place ever again. Everything that was reviewed is correct. Bland no flavour and they gave me the incorrect order. I wish i read their reviews on yelp first before ordering from them."}
{"text":"I wanted an alternative to Taco Bell so I figured I'd give la Tortilleria a try. We had tacos and a burrito which we felt tasted bland and dry - there wasn't the punch of flavour you would typically find in Mexican food. I must say, you get big portions but if it doesn't taste good it doesn't matter.   I must've say, La Tortilleria is a great spot for Mexican groceries, specifically fresh tortillas, but not for food."}
{"text":"Not a great experience here. On the plus side, excellent guacamole and tortillas. But it was 20 minutes for our order, the steak could use some tenderizing as it was very chewy, the beans were thin, the meat flavourless, the nacho chips tasted slightly stale, and there's no garbage receptacle on the patio. I'd only go back for tortillas to take home."}
{"text":"The soy chorizo / veg option is amazing! And the little marketplace in-store allows us to take our favourite products home. We will keep coming back every time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"got the chicken mole quesadilla on whole wheat... as a canadian raised with guatemalan family, i'm always torn between wanting authentic products while also loving the variety of ingredients in less traditional tex-mexxy dishes...  so they hit the sweet spot for me me with the combo of ingredients without skimping on any... guac, fresh queso, black beans, very fresh corn kernels. also nice touch with the corn tortilla layer inside. delicious without being sloppy. and considering the size of the thing it wasn't overly heavy, had no issues scarfing the whole without regret...."}
{"text":"I don't know what I was doing when I didn't know this existed. Haha, okay I'm exaggerating a bit but I live around the corner from this place and never really went in due to the exterior. It looks like a wholesale food place. Very dark inside. Doesn't really look like a dine-in place or restaurant. Was very cold waiting for a friend on the corner when I saw 3 people walk out with take-out boxes. I went in and ordered some tacos. Holy moly! I was so ecstatic with the quality. They are so well priced and sooo authentic and delicious. Amazing, fresh, organic tortillas and fresh ingredients made and cut to order. I went 2 days ago and went again today. Definitely a new favourite spot. Quality is 100%.. wish they had fish. I said that today. They need to add fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Cool, authentic little Mexican grocery.  I can't really add to the other reviews, except;  Mexican Coke Alert - if you're making the trip especially for this sugary treat, call first.  I snapped up the last 3 355ml bottles while I was there (1.79 ea).  I suggest you phone first...they don't keep a lot on hand.  416-901-7842 Dufferin 647-344-2429 St. Clair  The 546 number shown in the Yelp listing is the Head Office number.    (She only mentioned the St. Clair location as an alternate, so I wonder if the Kensington location moved?)"}
{"text":"I don't find the food bland. I like the fact that it is not too salty. All flavors are well balanced and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Plus, the price is quite affordable and services good too."}
{"text":"You know what? It wasn't bad. Not at all. I'm actually kind surprised this spot isn't more of a 3 or 3.5 average but it's close so perhaps it'll average out there in the long run.   First off, the parking here is kinda crap, that's my main gripe. You're told you can use the killing tire parking but my fiancée didn't feel safe parking behind an empty garage in an industrial area after dark and neither did I. Instead we parked in front of Kipling tire in one of the 3 tight spots.   Walking in, this place was great, lots of seating and additional seating upstairs with a rooftop patio. I had to laugh a bit here because while a rooftop patio is posh to have... usually it's to look at \"something\"? Here at la tortelleria you get a fabulous view of... Kipling Ave traffic and the Ontario hydro building. Yay?  That said perhaps it's a better place in summer months and there's some excitement I'm not aware of.   It's a fast casual dining experience which does not include table service. Sort of a mcdonalds/fast food experience with nicer seating and a liquor license. You go up to the counter, place your order and find a seat, they call you when it's ready. The service was friendly and quick - it also was empty when we went so we likely got their undivided attention.   We ordered an assortment of tacos between the two of us. The expectation is that you'll buy three of one kind for a lower price but having never been here we bought 5 different single tacos and an order of tortilla chips with guacamole.   My fiancée had the two vegetarian option tacos and liked them both. I was impressed they had two vegetarian friendly options so good on them. I, on the other hand, ordered the chicken, the beefsteak, and the chorizo. The tacos were simple, flour tortilla and meat, no other filling. I appreciated the simplicity of these as it allowed me to properly appreciate and assess the quality of the fillings. My favourite was the chorizo, it had the most flavour but it was the skimpiest on the meat which was a downer. The chicken was my second favourite as it was pretty moist, a little bland for sure but was packed with meat. The beefsteak was my least favorite, it was dry, very bland but had a fair amount of filling.   The chips and guacamole were OK. The chips were very tasty but the guacamole was served in a tiny side container and was whipped so definitely not made to order.   The chips and the tacos came with both the salsa verde and the smokier salsa which are signature creations of this place and you can buy tubs of it to take home.   As others mentioned, if you're looking for real toppings for an at home taco night this is your place. Several varieties of hard to find Mexican queso, a bunch of dried chili peppers, fresh chorizo sausage, tortillas and tortilla chips and of course their salsa.   Lastly they also have the authentic Mexican juices like my recently discovered new fave - Hibiscus juice. I didn't have theirs but I plan on it next time.   Definitely a good spot to grab some quick cheap tacos (total bill was about $30-35 with tax tips and soft drinks). Not a fancy night out so save this for when hunger strikes and you want better than Taco Bell and McDonald's and don't have the time to sit and wait at a more formal restaurant.   EATCREST out!"}
{"text":"Really great food, incredibly friendly staff, good sized portions. Be forewarned that even the mild salsa has a bit of a kick."}
{"text":"La Tortilleria is a Mexican bakery specializing in tortillas. There is seating in the front area with the order counter in the back. Along with some chicken breast from Sanagan's, tortillas would complete supper. They have 3 styles, a classic white which is the easiest to roll, yellow corn, and a purple one. You can mix and match. They use a scale and sell them by weight. When I got home, I realized how fresh they were as they were still quite warm!  Be clear that theses circle shaped pieces of bread will amaze your senses especially if you are used to the slimy Dempsters pre frozen versions. The texture is incredible! The other item I inquired about is Mexican salsa and she pointed to their convenient tasting station where you can try the green cilantro themed one or the BBQ flavored chipotle style version. Unlike Costco samples, this one had no one telling you when to stop, so careful there! Both delicious, these are mildly spicy salsas made fresh with crunchy onions and bursting with flavor. They are in the fridge behind you.  Only 4 stars because they don't have the large tortillas, only the small ones.  It's a welcoming space, and a nice retreat from the market bustle, up on the second floor with a picture perfect view of one of the most fun to watch corners on the planet."}
{"text":"La Tortilleria has a fantastic range of import Mexican groceries - canned goods, dried chillies, sauces, beans, desserts, snacks & drinks. Just as good as any of the little Mexican marts in Kensington Market, really - but much more handy if you don't want to head downtown.  Also on offer are the fresh salsas, tortillas & chips that other reviews talk about - while i've not purchased them, they are dead cheap and i've been meaning to try them for a while.  Prices for the whole store apart from that are pretty reasonable considering the import nature of most of the goods. Easy to get to from Dufferin Station, handy to waddle back laden down with bags of delicious groceries!"}
{"text":"Uninspired, dry... The chorizo was so salty, I couldn't get through my meal. Parking is very limited so best to walk or take TTC. But, my recommendation is to spend your hard earned money elsewhere..."}
{"text":"This place peaked my interest as I saw the sign saying fresh tortillas every day.  So I made sure to pass check it out the next time I am in the area.  When I walked in it wasn't really a place I expected it to be. This is small store with a simple layout and two counters.  Again the focus is on Mexican food items but the variety wasn't anything special. Now given I am not an expert on Cuisine from that region I didn't know much about what are the hard to find ingredients here.  Sure there was a lot of dried peppers and prepared salsas but nothing really stood out for me. Apart from the peppers and some spices I have noticed these items elsewhere. This place is very sparse and has no frills approach.  Location is decent if you take the TTC otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to try em.  P.S. I will buy fresh tortillas one day and update the review. 2.5 Stars."}
{"text":"So I've been eyeing this restaurant for quite some time now since renovations had started...I had hungry eyes for this restaurant for days!!! I had finally got the chance to try it out today & boy I was in for a surprise.  I ordered the chorizo on a hard taco w/ cheese & Pico de Gallo & my bf ordered a soft taco w/ chicken & Pico de Gallo. My bf is a picky eater & the fact that they had different options for the tortillas was great! What they had was corn tortilla , flour tortilla & blue corn tortilla which was organic & once the word organic rolled out of the employees mouth which he didn't finish saying the \"nic\" part lol...my bf banged on opted for the organic tortilla.   We had our order to go & when we got home, I hovered my entire meal of 4 hard tacos in just minutes. The hard taco is something I'm iffy about eating as it gets REAL messy & cracks & crumbles just fall apart BUT this time was a different story here @ La Tortilla as I took my first bite of my hard taco, what I experienced was phenomenonal....as I took my first bite...it nicely crunched to the shape of my mouth & no mess was found here !  All in all, I'm very glad to have a mexican spot near our place as I'm just gaga over mexican cusine :) I surely am will be a regular here & I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the other reviews I am reading...this place is close to my office...I've driven past it for as long as it has been existence...one day...my daughter and I decided (I'm not sure why...nothing about it looks appetizing...although from a distance...in a car...looks perhaps cute) to try it...everything about it however...is nasty...the tortillas I must admit...were OK...but to call the interior depressing is an understatement...the fillings were all bland, overcooked to be mush...bland....and again...extremely unappetizing...to top it off...when paying...they had no change to give...so I had to give about a 40% (thoroughly undeserved) top!"}
{"text":"I am by no means a Mexican food expert having only eaten at Milagros and Mexican Lindos.  But I really enjoyed what I had at La Tortilleria.    I have been twice already.  The first time I had 3 house tacos (one each of veggie fajita, nopalitos and soy-rizo) with white corn tortilla.  All three tasted very fresh with very different flavours.  I chose the hot salsa which was tasty but not very spicy.  This came with the best nachos I have ever had, crispy and light.  I ordered the same on my second visit but chose the organic blue corn tortilla and asked for something to kick it up.  I definitely prefer the blue corn and they added chopped jalapenos which gave everything an extra punch.  I opted out of rice as I found it too filling the first time.    They have only been opened a couple of weeks and do need to work out a few kinks.  They still have empty picture frames on the wall and their bathroom, though very clean, needs some minor work.  Staff are still learning the ropes but were very friendly and helpful.  Great options for vegetarians/vegans.  Will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"I love burritos, and these are the best burritos I've ever had. I only wish the atmosphere of the restaurant would match the quality and charm of their food. The seating area is boring and in need of renovation. Bathroom is rickety and dirty. There's a terrible broken speaker at their tv that gives me a headache and makes me want to take my food to-go. Despite these issues I keep coming back because the food is just amazing."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with friends today to try it out as our regular Mexican place was closed.  Taco bell would have been three steps up. Food was overpriced and poor quality.  Ordered Guacamole and tortilla chilps and got chips with some been dip and hot sauce in them.  Meat in the tacos tasted like it was leftover from a bullfight. It was tough and flavorless.  Ordered Quesadillas, got two taco's stuck together. Price was about 15.00 per person and was not up to taco bell standards.  Overall a big letdown that disappointed all of us. Not recommended unless you want to take the inlaws.  This was one of my worst decisions ever.  No wonder this place is always empty.  Would not recommend for any reason"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the Mexican popsicles, paletas, that they carry which are actually from Wrestlers but that store no longer exists.  Flavours: brownie, strawberry, Nutella, raspberry, Mojito and pineapple. Price was over $9 for two, which lost them a star.  The mojito was basily and limey, very delicious and flavourful.  They also lost a star because their napkins are basically useless, really cheap considering the price point of the product. Would go back though because I do love a paleta on a hot day!"}
{"text":"I used to love La Tortllleria when they first opened. They always had a good selection of white or yellow corn tortilla (I prefer the yellow), but the past few times I've been here, they are out of the yellow. How can you be out of yellow corn tortillas when it's noon and you just opened?   The staff aren't the friendliest. I went in today and as I approached the counter the girl said 'The menu is THERE\" and pointed to the food menu on the adjacent wall. I replied that I was looking at the Tortilla menu because I wanted to purchase tortillas and had already eaten my lunch.  I'm not crazy about the new packaging, either. I know they've become a larger chain, but I loved the tortillas wrapped in paper. The plastic bag feels so pre-fab.  I think I will be looking into a new place to purchase my tortillas."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Great ambience. Bad salsa, bad tacos. Just avoid the place. The nachos were old. The tacos wraps were bad too."}
{"text":"Tonight was a complete miss. The Friday night crew was more focused on hanging out than providing great attentive service. I tried the chicken tinga burrito. Big mistake. It came out shaped like a large square diaper. I bit into it and four bites in found a cold wad of cheese shred. I notified the girl at the counter that I'd like two tacos instead (which cost less than one burrito). After some attitude, she agreed to have them made. They were pretty good - much better than the burrito, though I was pretty disappointed with the employee's defensiveness towards returning the burrito.   Owner - teach your crew the art of making a burrito. Burrito layering and rolling 101.."}
{"text":"This restaurant presents itself as traditional Mexican food, and tastes like anything but. Even if you just want to stop in for a burrito, I'd recommend anywhere else. And why did you start keeping your tortillas in the fridge?! Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Very bland food, basically a take out place. They have beers listed on the menu board but they were out of drafts, out of Modelo, and the Corona wasn't cold! Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"I had high expectations after my last burrito experience (Tacofino). One thing they beat Tacofino on was the vintage glass bottle Coke, which made it feel authentic! The Guac wasn't fresh, kind of tasteless. I had pork carnitas on my burrito, it tasted good. Otherwise a fairly okay burrito but nothing to write home to mamasita about.  Tortilla chips were nice, not salty, and the salsa needed 'more'.  Quick service and the glass bottle saved this from being a 2!"}
{"text":"I popped in quickly for a taco after reading about this place in NOW under \"Cheap Eats\". I really enjoyed the mole taco. The tortillas were really nice, but I thought they were a little small. The food was delicious, but for $6+ for 3 tacos, I thought I would be more satisfied.   I am keen to share my knowledge of this spot with my friends. I think its a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I love Mexican food. This was terrible. My guacamole had no flavor. My tortilla chips were bland. Overall it was a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place actually totally exceeded our expectations. We stopped here on a whim after shopping at Dufferin Mall, and it was surprisingly good. My boyfriend got a pork burrito, I'm not exactly sure which one. But it was delicious, the staff was really nice, and we loved the free nacho bowl! The sauces were really good too. I'm not in love with the fact that you are limited to their juices and cold pressed coffee, because they were sort of expensive (a bottle of cold pressed coffee was $4.50) so I just drank tap water. All in all I would 110% come back, and I'm hoping to soon!"}
{"text":"Avoid.   Only one person behind the counter trying to do everything during busy lunch rush.  Left after being patient for 10 mins & walked across the street to Jumbo Empanadas."}
{"text":"I was seated at the end of a long table by the window.  There were no other customers in the place, so there were at least a dozen empty chairs.  An employee came from the back to eat her lunch and - out of all the options - chose the spot two seats down from me.  She bumped into the table and shook it, banged her plate and water bottle on it, hunched over her food like a troll, picked at her food (pulling hairs out of it), and ate noisily.  Then she started playing videos on her phone, adding the aural experience of listening to her eat.  UGH.  It's bad enough when customers behave like this but a restaurant's employees should try to class it up!  I asked the guy at the cash if there was a manager around and he said no.  That explains a lot.  He clearly had no idea why I was even asking.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Amazing spot. First time there tonight, got the tacos and grande burrito. Staff was lovely and their recommendations were stellar. The tortillas were fresh, chicken was fresh and they even had some chips and salsa to snack on while waiting for your food. Took no longer than ten minutes to get your full meal. Awesome spot, im so glad that I found it. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Super cute place along Kipling. They have a bunch of cool drinks, tortilla chips, house made salsa, and other goods along the walls, and they have a pretty decent menu. I had the combo with Taco Del Pueblo, and I enjoyed it, it was very affordable and a decent meal. The one thing I wish is that you could mix and match tacos with the combo, as you can only get one kind of taco. At any rate, good place for a quick meal, really quiet. I would like to go back and check out their rooftop patio as it looks really cool!"}
{"text":"I'm so sick and tired of people who rate a place based on a set of criteria that don't apply. You have to adjust your expectations based on where you are going. You don't rate McDonald's based on the criteria you would rate Harbor 60 Steak House.  This is basically a tortilla factory that also offers food because of the access to AMAZING fresh tortillas. So viewing the food and experience through that lens, here is the only accurate review posted here so far.  I had a carnitas burrito. I have had many burritos in my day. This was easily in the top 5 of my entire life. The tortilla was unreal fresh and grilled after being assembled. Ingredients were top notch in flavor and freshness.  If you're looking for a fairly authentic taco, burrito, etc with extremely authentic and amazing fresh tortillas then this is the place for you.  It's not a fancy burrito chain. It's a whole in the wall burrito factory that makes kick ass food with their freshly made tortillas. Take it for what it is and you'll love it.  Oh ya, and its freaking CHEAP! I think $8.00 for the Super Grande burrito which was (I kid you not) the size of my shoe. You just can't find that kind of deal easily in expensive ass Canada anymore.  AND DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH A TACO SALAD! ARE YOU COMPLETELY DAFT! IT'S A FAKKING TORTILLA FACTORY AND YOU DON'T GET A TORTILLA? WTF!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here zillionth of times, however, it never came to my mind to eat in there; why would it be?  I'm always pro to indulge, so I wouldn't care to have a taco while they charge me the groceries. Now that I'm thinking about it, I realize the reason is: the smell hasn't been appealing or evident. When they are cooking good food you salivate, turns out you want a piece of that.  With the groceries I have encounter feelings. I know they are successful hard workers trying to consolidate their brand. For my rustic taste, the cinnamon, hierba santa, mole, epazote, orégano, and the rest of authentic Mexican ingredients look way too fancy on those perfectly sealed bags. Standing in front gives me the sensation of being in a commercial with  scenography you wouldn't find in Mexico (I rather the bulk containers and the smells of spices).  It would be cool for the stores to have the tortillas machine rolling up with hot-freshly made tortillas, being asked if I want 1/2kilo-1 kilo with paper, or without... But I know I'm nostalgic of how a real tortillería works in Mexico."}
{"text":"The food tastes good but just waited for half an hour for ONE taco.  there was only me and one other person in here at the time."}
{"text":"The tortillas from La Tortilleria are amazing. The selection of fresh ingredients (fresh cheeses, salsa, guac) is equally impressive though the space needs a little revamping. Great staff as well--Daniel is very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Be warned vegetarians, canned everything, and that's if they have it in stock. Bland, boring, and nothing special."}
{"text":"I don't leave many reviews, but I felt the need to after our incredibly disappointing dinner this evening. It was quite likely the worst burrito we have ever had. Both mine and my husbands burrito(s) were incredibly dry and had not even an ounce of flavour (to the point where the most overpowering taste was the rice...which is plain white rice and has close to no taste). We actually ended up emptying all of the contents from the burritos and just eating the tortilla to fill our stomachs with something. We were so hungry after a long day and the past few times we ordered they were unable to fulfil our order because they were \"too busy\"--we thought this was a great sign so when we finally were able to pick up an order we were surprised! Now we know that \"busy\" probably meant \"lazy\", and will never EVER order from there again. I will also add that by no means are we food snobs--the food was just THAT terrible (we both said this multiple times throughout the meal as we forced ourselves to finish)   Save your money friends!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now for lunch and Yelp has prompted me to write a review so here I am. La Tortilleria is a restaurant that specializes in tortilla chips and soft tortillas available for retail purchase. However if you're craving for pretty decent Mexican food, they also have everything from burritos to tacos to tostada/quesadillas called tezcadillas.   The first time we ate there, one could order individual tacos for around $3-4, which allowed us to try a few different types of tacos. The server was very enthusiastic about the soy-rizo taco (soy based meatlike filling reminiscent of chorizo) so I tried it. The flavour and texture of the soy-rizo were similar to meat but I did find the filling salty. I also ordered the slow cooked pork carnitas taco, which was delicious. The tacos were packed with protein, flavour, and cool creamy guacamole. My friend quite liked their black bean taco. We also tried their bottled aguas frescas in tamarind and hibiscus, and although a bit sweet, they are indeed very refreshing.  On our second visit, the menu had changed. Thinking three of us could share two orders of the taco trios, we were disappointed when we learned that each order had to consist of the same flavour for all 3 tacos. Next time, although $3.75 for each taco, I think I would order individual tacos just to be able to order a selection of tacos with my order.  Truth be told I still prefer the other better known taqueria in Kensington in terms of freshness and overall flavour. La Tortilleria doesn't have fish tacos (only veggie and meat options). However this place is less busy, has lots of seating inside and on their patio, and you can buy tortillas and Mexican cheeses like cotija to make your own Mexican feast at home."}
{"text":"The pollo tacos were delightful- not overly spiced yet so tasty! The guacamole was well made and... let me tell you.. the fresh chips were yummy. They had options for our GF, veggie, and meat loving friends."}
{"text":"I will compare this place to the only other Tex Mex places I have been in the GTA and know well - Chipotle and Chorizo. La  Torilleria is not in the same class in terms of taste and freshness.  I went in with an open mind but it was disappointing and having frequented the other two places mentioned above, they are far tastier.  Although I would say the decor is equally bad in both Chorizo and La Torilleria, if you want inexpensive good Tex Mex, try Chipotle or Chorizo."}
{"text":"I have been back several times and not updated my review. The Tacos are delicious, especially with their fresh home-made salsa. I always pick some up along with corn Tortillas and Pico de gallo, for making more at home. The ambiance was part of the low rating, but GOOD NEWS La Tortilleria has just moved up the street into the old \"Franks on Kipling!\" They will have a massive patio, and soon a liquor license. Looking forward to summer beers and tacos in the sun soon!"}
{"text":"Picked up a kilo of fresh tortillas for my BBQ. They were out of salsa, but I will be back for more. Will also buy a bottle of Mexican Coke too!"}
{"text":"I really, really, really want to give La Tortilleria 5 stars based on the food alone.  It was a bit of a weird experience, though so one star off.  :(    While visiting Toronto last weekend, I and 3 others were wandering around Kensington Market during one of the pedestrian Sundays.  What a beautiful day it was, too!  We were trying to find somewhere that wasn't so busy to eat that also had some outdoor seating.  La Tortilleria is sort of hidden in the middle of some other businesses.  (It's moved since the photos were posted.)  When we walked in, the place looks quite clean and presentable up front.  On the walk back to the washroom, I could tell that they're still in the process of making the place presentable - changing the floors and installing some of the kitchen appliances.  However, the owners were making do the best they could with what they have with a smile.    They seemed a little surprised to have customers walk in.  I'm not sure exactly why.  It does appear that they should have maybe waited a few days to open (reopen?) so they could get some more things organized first.  It did take a little while to get our food and that was a bummer.  However - our guacamole was made fresh right as we ordered it and that was part of what took a few minutes.  I don't mind that, it tasted amazing.  I wish I could remember the names of everything we ate.  We shared some guacanachos which were simple, but super fantastic.  It's basically homemade tortilla chips covered in refried black beans and guacamole.  Soooo good.  I could eat that all day long.  Two of us got an assortment of tacos - a few spinach and potato tacos (there is name for this kind, but I forget it) and a few mixed veggie tacos (these had zucchini and corn and a few other veggies), both with rice and beans inside as well, all on soft corn tortillas.  Again - absolutely delicious and well worth the wait.  The others had some sort of meat taquito thing that came with fresh guacamole and some chicken and cheese quesadillas.  Being a vegan, I didn't taste any of their food, but they said it was amazing.    I lived in South Florida and then Texas for a few years and got quite used to eating Mexican food often.  It's hard to find good, authentic-tasting Mexican food, but this is it for sure.  I only wish I didn't live in Vancouver so I could go back here more often!  An added bonus - they sell some Mexican food items as well.  Stuff like salsas and hot sauce and corn husks and Mexican chocolate blocks.  I can't find most of that stuff here in Vancouver so I bought a bag full of goodies to bring home with me.  Definitely go here, but don't go if you're in hurry or if you're impatient.  Good food takes time, I guess.  ;)"}

With regards to the grocery store it was over-priced and they DID NOT HAVE Menudo.....Mexican...I think not!   I stopped there after seeing the menu...they almost only to Tortillas and I thought they must do them well. Save yourselves."}
{"text":"I cant provide a review about their tacos but their Churros are horrible! Takes forever to get served, a little filling and uncooked in the middle.   Their mole paste is good."}
{"text":"Meat was dry and salty, tortilla also dry. Guac was meh and salsa was gross. So dry and salty I might as well have taken a trip to the desert."}
{"text":"This was a very fresh quality tasty meal which happens to be very inexpensive ,don't expect too much ambience it is a very very good and cheap, I'm shocked by the other reviews but take it in context this place is a tortilla factory ,if you like Mexican food real Mexican food then give it a try!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst meal I've had in a restaurant in quite some time. I'm not sure if this is primarily a lunch place, but when me and my family went on a Saturday evening the only option was the tacos. We ordered a variety - for every single on the the meat was dry (as if they had prepared earlier in the day and we were served what was left) and the meat was unseasoned. Maybe if we had gone for lunch the food would have been better.  On a positive note, it looked nice in terms of a casual place to fine with friends."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, great Mexican groceries.  I love the new location also."}
{"text":"A few days ago I was in Kensington market looking for some good tacos. The place my friends and I were going to go was closed so on impulse we decided to check this place out. I ordered 2 tacos, beef and chicken and they were both pretty cheap (around $3 each). From what I could tell, this place only offered soft tacos but no hard tacos so that was kindof a let down.  Unfortunately, the tacos didn't taste very good at all. The chicken was alright, but the beef had an awful after taste. They were both pretty dry and should've been cooked with more oil. My friend also ordered some tortilla chips and they were stale. There's a lot of great taco places at Kensington market so I recommend looking elsewhere before going in here."}
{"text":"While waiting for a dance class to start, I decided I would head over to Kensington a bit earlier to grab a bit to eat.  After wandering around the street with that \"ooohhh what do I want to eat\" look on my face, I settled on this place mainly b/c:  1. It's close to my dance class so I wouldn't have to walk too far 2. It wasn't packed so I figured I could get my food and have time to enjoy it 3. Always on the lookout for some good Mexican food  Well numbers 1 and 2 worked....number 3..not so much.  The staff are really friendly and helped me figure out the menu.  I ordered the beef chipotle taco on the lime tortilla  (forgot what it's called - something like Nixatel...).  I asked the server which was his favourite and he said this one.  They have blue corn/yellow corn/white corn tortillas.  I think you can also buy a pack of 36 for about $3 which seems pretty cheap to me.  Anyways, while waiting for your order you can snack on some homemade chips and salsa.  This was the best thing about this place.  In fact I could have eaten this for dinner.  I actually should have.  The salsa had that nice spicy kick to it - just enough to be flavourful but not burn your mouth scorching hot kinda salsa.  I need my mouth in working order, thank you very much!  So back to my beef taco..(really..must we?).  It wasn't anything special.  It did taste fresh with the tomatoes and cilantro...but that was about it. No real flavour to the beef unfortunately.  I just ordered one which came up to less than $5 (they are pretty small, but I wanted more of a snack).  I think for more of a meal you need at least 3.  There is plenty of seating inside, but it looks tired and in need of one of those Restaurant Makeover shows to ambush it.  There are also a few picnic tables outside where you can eat and people watch to your heart's content"}
{"text":"The fresh nacho chips are terrific.  Wasn't crazy about the beef; lot of sauce, not overly that fond of the taste.  Chicken was good, not great. Service a bit slow.  I would try again, but not thrilled with experience, nor the prices."}
{"text":"Terrible Burritos. My own fault for ordering a Burrito in a Mexican place I suppose! Bland, flavourless, and cold salad inside mixed with luke-warm black beans.   Taco portions tiny for the price of $9 something but tasted ok. Also not sure if soy sausage was gmo - to buy packages not labelled as non-gmo or organic.   Oscura dark beer was good but expensive for a tiny glass.   Overall bad food experience. So many better options in Kensington market...   Stick to buying the packs of tortillas to take home, they are the only thing worth buying."}
{"text":"Came here once to pick up dinner.  Friendly service and decent food.  Will likely come back again to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"great place to buy taco shells, great chips they make too,restaurant quality,they also sell sauces too, very busys hot table for food at lunchtime,food is usually good,guacamole has a funny watery texture at times. suggestion:buy the corn chips and shells and make your own yummy stuff at home,dont understand why folks are so critical,this place is primarily a supplier to the trade and just has a small restaurant as a afterthought/courtesy i think"}
{"text":"Super awesome, my first visit, I loved the Horchata and the Burrito was excellent, good quality food, great friendly service. Highly recommended, I will return again!"}
{"text":"I've only been here like two times since I've seen it open.  And I have to say, the tacos and burrito is excellent.  I really like the filling and the seasoning as well as the fact that I get to eat chips and salsa as I wait for my food.  Service is fair, and the quality of the food is also fair."}
{"text":"Amazingly bland Mexican food. The place looks great inside. Parking is kind of minimal."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I haven't actually been to mexico so can't tell how authentic this place is.   Coming to this store made you feel like you were on vacation and discovering new things. Groceries / food items were unique and you've never seen any of these products before. Wish I knew what to try and how to use all the spices and products here!   We had two different kinds of tacos here. The mole and the chorizo. We liked the chorizo more but the mole was also good. The taco shells were very fresh and was a little sweeter than what you'd normally get in other places. We didn't have a preference for either the sweeter shell or not, but wondered if that was what they tasted like in mexico.   They had free tortilla and salsa at the counter, which was great. Staff were friendly. They also had freshly baked bread daily which we will be trying next time!"}
{"text":"Blah burrito.  And it had a lot of white rice in it (aka cheap filler). I got a beef (bad choice - it was tough beef strips) burrito, that cost about $7.50. It was also sticky (the bland white rice was so over cooked, it was on the verge of mush) and had very little flavour -- it didn't taste flavourful or fresh.  I'm pretty positive everything in it was canned, which they conveniently actually sell on site. They have a small retail area, which consists of a few shelves of very basic Mexican canned product, such as retried beans and tomatillos. I recognized the brand as one I've seen in No Frills in the ethnic food isle.  .  There are so many other 'mexicana' choices in Kensington, I will never give this place second look."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service. At least they are consistent. Sorry folks, this is the worst ever. Nice branding, but they need to get help with food quality. Dry, over cooked meats, hidden under tasteless sauces, and served on stale bland tortillas. C'mon people, do Mexico proud and step up your game."}
{"text":"I really should have known that this place was going to disappoint me by the empty patio - a rarity on a hot summer day; but I thought hey, I could be wrong, it's happened before.  we entered the store- and the cool AC sent me straight to heaven - I thought, see? I was wrong - well, I was. I bought 4 soft tacos - one of each kind - they didn't have any cherizo one left, which was disappointing but I thought, well, now I can try new things; I shouldn't have.  There were 2 kids serving; no green or red salsa left- which was disappointing to my friend. What made it worse was the fact that when my friend walked out the door, the boy pulled out a massive container of salsa to fill them up :O  The \"fresh tortilla\" was not fresh- maybe they did make it that day, but it was 6pm on a humid day and and what you made at 5am just may not keep. Maybe it was meant to taste doughy, but I've had home made tortilla and that was not the case.  3 tacos out of 4 were - unsavory - but by the time I got to the ONE that was good my appetite was severely ruined and I could not stomach it.   Now, I'm a BIG fan of food, Mexican being my top 5 - from that, tacos and burritos tickle my fancy any hour of the day - I would eat just about anything but not this. I was STARVING.FAMISHED but this was not going down.   WHY I paid $12 for 4 unsavory tacos and a warm can of grape crush, I have no clue -because Burrito Boys and Chippy's were in walking distance... but I took one for the team and now you know not to go to this location. I hear the other locations are great; I'll have to go try, even if just to revive my love for tacos."}
{"text":"The Mole Burrito was great.  The Cactus tacos were bland and soggy. Skip these.   The service was not helpful. I asked the guy which hot sauce was the best and he said \"I never eat anything from here\". Nice. I also asked \"how long does take out take?\" He said \"depends how hot the grill is\"  The groceries are cool if you're looking for authentic spices and chillis. I would come here for a take out burrito again, but the atmosphere/customer service is lackluster."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a friend who loves this place and now I know why!  Got the 3 taco combo with chips and salsa, perfect combo portion! The chorizo tacos were amazing! They were slightly dry which would be my ONLY complaint but with the added salsa it was perfect!"}
{"text":"After our trip to Mexico my bf and I were exited about having \"authentic mexican\" food again. We ordered the carnitas and the beef n' chorizo tacos. First the tacos had way to much onion on top so we had to remove a lot of it, the carnitas where extremely dry and favor less, the steak was super dry too but it had flavor because of the chorizo. The chips, the guac and the salsas were good. Finally, the agua de tamarindo was great!"}
{"text":"Good and genuine mexican fast food. Best cheap fast food option in that area. Selection is somewhat limited as it's more of a lunchcounter kind of experience but the three tacos deal is amazing and fast."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place .. but I just cant.  One star because of GOOD, SPEEDY SERVICE.  If I could give negative stars because of the food, I would. The guacanachos were BIG, but TASTELESS. So were the tacos. Chicken tasted like boiled chicken with no salt, pork tasted like pulled pork with no sauce. Size was big but all were bland and zero taste. Not even a jarload of salsa can save this.   Unfortunately,  WILL NOT BE BACK. unless I need fresh corn toritillas."}
{"text":"Meh. I ordered their steak and chorizo tacos on UberEATS and they were bland. Not bad, but not great. Looking for super tasty tacos? Go to La Carnita. Much, much better!"}
{"text":"Three stars is a bit of a stretch. The friendliness of the staff caused me to bump the review up from two stars.  Here are a few highlights (and lowlights)...  1. The restaurant is a tired space where you order at the counter and wait for your food. The patio also manages to be equally sterile and cramped. 2. They have an extensive selection of dried peppers and sauces for sale. You can check these out while you are waiting for your food. 3. The portions are generous, but nothing is great. The meat tastes like it has been soaking in grease or just hanging around at least all day. Ingredients are either bland or very spicy without much nuance. 4. They do play up the fact that they make their tortillas fresh daily. They are good, but are still tortillas. 5. They do have bottled beers, as well as bottled Mexico coke. 6. Prices here are similar to Burrito Boyz and maybe a dollar less than Chipotle. The food is not as good as either."}
{"text":"Ugh. I was so desperate to find a real Mexican restaurant and this place is far from real, authentic, or tasty Mexican fare. Everything hubby and I ordered was so bland and tasteless. We ordered the soft tacos with chicken mole, chicken tinga, and barbacoa. None of the tacos tasted like anything - like I mean nothing, nada, zippo. Even the tortillas were tasteless and not warmed or given any browning. We also ordered a chicken mole burrito and I have never tasted anything so disgusting. I have been dying for an authentic mole but do not bother - it tasted like dirty dish water. We ordered a carnitas chimichanga which, again, was dreadful and tasted like wet socks. Lastly we ordered churros - 1 chocolate and 1 caramel. The dough seemed doughy and bland again which is astonishing considering I have had churros at fairgrounds that tasted better and were less doughy.  If I was able to, I would give 0 stars. This place should be out of business soon but do not bother stopping in at this faux Mexican place. Blech."}
{"text":"I drove by this little joint many times, so I was glad I was finally here last Sunday.  Oop, no fish taco.  No problem.  Fish tacos are tricky to do well and cheap unless there is a large turnover anyway.  I ordered a chicken mole taco, a pulled pork taco and a beef enchilada taco, all in double yellow corn tortillas.  All together was a bargain $8 plus tax.  The chicken mole and the beef enchilada tacos were okay.  They were moist and actually tasted somewhat like chicken mole and beef enchilada, though I wished the flavours could be more intense.  The pulled pork taco was disappointing because it was seriously dry, rendering the pork flavorless (bland would be too flavourful a description).  This issue should be easy enough to fix for these two helpful and friendly staffs behind the counter, considering that they could pull off a beef enchilada taco just fine.    I like that you can choose from 5 types of tortillas (white corn, yellow corn, blue corn, crispy, white flour), 5 types of sauces and a variety of toppings.  The yellow corn tortillas are quite soft and tasty.  La Tortilleria also sells burritos, chimichanga, churro and other entrees and sides.  I love taco joint.  My appetite is wetted. I will be back to try the blue tortillas and burritos later.  Plus I love $8 for 3 tacos (or $9 for 4)."}
{"text":"This is pretty much a convenient store with Latin products and a fast food counter which sells pretty bland tacos.   Not terrible but certainly nothing very special.   It is a good place to stop by to buy Mexican imported products but I would pass on eating there.   Seriously bland"}
{"text":"I don't usually rate places unless they blow me away this place is amazing and has totally earned 5 stars"}
{"text":"A nice place to grab a quick bite to eat. It's in the middle of Kensington market. Clean, fast, and the chicken tacos are good. Oh and the have Coke in a bottle! What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Came to this place with my 9 years old son and try to order a plain chicken quesadilla for him and it seems to be impossible to make it, at least, this is what the guy at the cashier  told me, also said that this will be too spensive for me because it was very simple, that I should order just the taco in that case, after listening to his ridiculous advice, I decide it to order a  basic chicken taco and than he sreply to me: we can only make chicken Tinga, sorry. Jajajajja what a joke. For a place that had only 3 person inside how can you prefer not to sale anything, feel sorry for the owner that let this people running his restaurant."}
{"text":"I visit La Tortilleria once a week for tortillas for my fish tacos.  They have both white and yellow corn and it's only $3 for about 30.  They also offer organic blue corn tortillas and I believe they cost about $6.50.   The homemade nacho chips are, without doubt, authentic Mexican restaurant quality - you can't stop eating them! The green and red salsa scream freshness and also made in-house.  Sometimes the red salsa is hit or miss as it can range from being very spicy to not-so-spicy; the last container I bought was loaded with the salt.  Not a huge selection of Mexican goods as you would think but you can get Queso Fresco, Mexican Chorizo and they have a good assortment of dried chilies.  Prices are not marked for most of the groceries so be sure to ask because it's fairly pricy.  If you're familiar with the area, just come up Norseman and make the quick right on Kipling and then another quick right, otherwise you may miss it.  There is nothing shady about the location, it's just very industrial.  The parking lot is small and extremely tight but, if you're just running in and can't find a spot, I would just park in Advance Tire's back lot.   I've only eaten from there once because I was starving and still had a lot of errands to run.  I ordered three tacos (Beef & Chorizo, Carnitas and Chicken Tinga) which I had to wait for 10 minutes, albeit the meat was already prepared.  It cost close to $10 and the woman was horrifically stingy on the fillings - probably (no word of a lie) about two tablespoons of meat per taco, some nasty soggy rice and some refried beans that had no taste. There was no salsa, cilantro, slaw or even Queso Fresco so it lacked a lot of freshness.  It's difficult to give a review of the meat itself because there was so little of it and the tortilla overpowered everything.  I can't understand the other reviews that the portions were generous. There was a gentleman in front of  that ordered the taco salad and it was half the size of the one depicted in Rob M.'s photo.  I would have given this business four stars if it wasn't for her and her cheaply made tacos!  Please scroll to the bottom of this page and read Tammy W.'s review that Yelp did not recommend for some reason."}
{"text":"I regret eating here. The food was so bland, not authentic at all (I've been to mexico many many times), Their meats are all sweet, they are just sitting there and the guy randomly scooped it and put it in a tortilla. There was no spice, just some huge chunks of onion thrown on top, the potatoes in the chorizo were under cooked, it was just a bad experience. The cheese was just average shredded white cheese thrown on top, not even melted. It was really cold too.   Overall, don't eat here. It's gross."}
{"text":"Very bland, even more dry. I could have eaten mulch and it would have had more moisture and maybe more flavor.  This seems to be a common complaint, I thought maybe they had taken note of these reviews... apparently not.  Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Guacamole is seriously lacking for flavour, too many beans and too much corn in my Tekzadilla to really tase anything else.   Decent Salsas helped a bit  Service was good"}
{"text":"First time I tried La Tortilleria, my party ordered a trio of tacos, ordering the works aka everything on it. Once our order was complete, they brought it to our table without any sour cream or meat on it!!! There are things as an oversight but when you ask for a meat dish and they skip the meat well that is just idiocy. We did not order vegetarian. We asked for a refund and left. Yesterday I returned after craving a burrito. I ordered a carnitas burrito and it was awful, the lettuce was wilted, I got about a tsp. of guacamole after asking for more, the staff member said there was none left, and the carnitas was dry and flavourless, like it had been sitting in the warmer for a few days, it probably was. I am confident this was my last time eating at this establishment. A real shame that La Tortilleria doesn't deliver the authentic, delicious flavours of Mexico. Maybe I am spoiled from having Chipotle, which is fantastic, fresh and always delicious."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, the taco selection is very limited and if desaire to go with individual selection of tacos you don't get salsa even when you pay more for each taco than the actual trip.    This place lacks of taste for service, tacos good but no worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is pretty authentic, but it's not really the style of tacos I'm a big fan of. The tacos they serve here come in many varieties, but all are stewed sorts of things. You can wash it all down with a glass bottle of coca-cola made in mexico (way better than coke made here IMO)  I tend to like tacos with grilled things in them or done on a spit, like pastor (I guess that's more of a Baja and sonora style of thing). I'm not sure what part of mexico these tacos originate from, but i bet they're fairly true to form. I mainly give it 3 stars for that reason.  One other thing. They do have freshly made corn tortillas daily which is nice. You can buy packs of 'em.  Tip: you can park along the wall of the place for free. there are approximately 2+ cars lengths there so if there's a spot available its yours."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken and carnitas tacos. They were bland and just awful. The drinks were a miss too. Not worth it. We made up for it with gelato across the street"}
{"text":"pizza tastes good, smells good. just perfect."}
{"text":"I can't vouch for the prepared dishes here, but the freshly made corn tortillas (36 for $3!!) are amazingly flavourful for cooking your own tacos at home! A fraction of the price you pay in supermarkets and way tastier! They sell other Mexican grocery items too (salsas, snacks)."}
{"text":"Super cute place along Kipling, but parking is a the worstttt.  To order, you go up to the counter, place your order, find a seat, and they call you when it's ready. The service was friendly and quick on the weekday afternoon we went.  They have a bunch of tortilla chips, house made salsa, and other goods along the walls that are for sale like a Mexican Speciality Grocer, and they have a pretty decent menu.   They also have a some tasty salsas for sampling at the front counter while you wait for your food.   I wish is that you could mix and match tacos with the combo, as you can only get one kind of taco. We did got around that by ordering two combos and just sharing though. Besides, that, it is good place for a quick meal."}
{"text":":/ It was so so. Food was not the best but ....I don't mean not good --just I'm not excited to go back and probably won't. They charge for sour cream and salsa which I think is strange since it's a Mexican restaurant... that's like charging for ketchup at a French fry joint in my opinion. And it's a while $2 for a tiny little cup lol. Also there's no taco sauce ! But I did buy some corn tortillas that I can't wait to use. They had a great selection of tortillas. Also the guac is not fresh guac"}
{"text":"This new location is awesome!  They have changed their menu and gone with more of a hip bar vibe.  portion sizes are good, as are the price points.  The flavour profiles on what they serve now have been tweeked, so they are a lot more consumer friendly.  The look of the food is also greatly improved.  Good place to have a beer with friends and chill."}
{"text":"Very tasty - parking is a bit of a nightmare at both their locations, but it is worth the annoyance.  Fresh, clean tastes with a good variety without being overwhelming. A small, but varied grocery/take-home section."}
{"text":"My friend had been talking about how great this restaurant was until I finally tried it. I ordered a chicken burrito and I was disappointed. The burrito was so small and the chicken was tough and burnt. I had a hard time eating it, but I made up my mind that I wasnt going to waste it because it was so expensive. If the chicken wasnt burnt and so tough it would of been a great burrito."}
{"text":"Aggressively bland \"mexican\" food. I didn't know you could make food this flavourless. Epic fail."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place on numerous occasions and always wanted to try it out, especially since I love Mexican food.    After reading the reviews of others, I was a bit turned off, but am glad I have it a shot.  The good: - very friendly staff - the food was pretty good, but a touch bland - nice decor on the inside - good portion sizes  The bad: - location.  It was very hard to turn into this plaza, especially if you going north.  I had to make a u-turn at the lights to get in. - cleanliness:  I noticed the space behind the counter and in the kitchen was a bit messy.  However, I was happy to see gloves being worn when making my food. - malfunctioning equipment:  the grill didn't seem to work when I was there.  But then it kicked in.     Overall, I'd return."}
{"text":"I've been passing by this place almost daily for the past 6 months and just had a chance to try it out - excellent tacos in a variety of different meats.  Will definitely be coming back here again soon!"}
{"text":"These are pretty good tortillas, they stay fresh inside the fridge for several days without going rancid or getting stiff. Having the gluten-free option is always welcomed, and the chips (totopos) are very very good. The price, $3.5 for a kilo... well, you're paying a premium for something fresh and better tasting than Old El Paso crap.  They also sell many Mexican products, although the prices seem slightly higher than other Latino stores in Kensington Market.  I haven't tried anything from the \"restaurant\" side of this place, so this is only a review of the main product (and thus the name): tortillas."}
{"text":"Well I used to love this place before the recent change from actual grocery store to quick serve restaurant. I couldn't find half the traditional ingredients that I used to including achiote, dried ancho, guajillo and chipotle. Also they now only sell a select group of salsas and tortillas instead of their huge offerings in years past.   The big downer is they dont have any of the El Yucateco product lines anymore ( which can be found in walmart now), tapatio is also noticeably absent. they still have some valentina and some house brands. I'll test them out another time to see if it meets expectations, but the prices over established and my favorite regional brands arent very appealing."}
{"text":"I've since gone back to La Tortilleria to try their tacos ($2.50 for 1, $8.50 for 4). They're a little small given the price, but really good. In a city with so few proper Mexican joints, this is a great find.  Also, for high-fructose corn syrup haters, La Tortilleria has Coke in glass bottles imported straight from Mexico. Mexican Coke is still made with real sugar and you can definitely taste the difference, though I'm still not sure which version I prefer."}
{"text":"Stick to buying the Tortillas (cant beat the price for half kilo! $2), salsas, frozen chorizo, cheese and the other pantry items for your next mexican meal or cook off. The food at the place is - bland! I have tried the house special tacos and the salads. The meats they have there - chicken (tinga/mole), pulled pork/carnitas or even the chorizos in a sauce overrun by potatoes - were all bland. Just no flavor in the food what so ever.  Parking is a bit confusing - the empty spots actually belong to the auto repair shop next door and i was told their parking is actually behind the store."}
{"text":"To be fair, the tortillas aren't bad, but this review is about the restaurant.  Bad. Stale. Flavorless. No condiments for the tacos. Things like onions and cilantro are \"extra\". I'm so bummed I picked this place out of all the excellent lunch options in Kensington today. Never again. They put rice on their tacos. RICE. I guess as filler to make them seem bigger. But big isn't the issue. Quality is the issue. Also overpriced.  These guys should stick to the tortillas or step up their lunch counter."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and stopped by to pick up tortillas and chorizo. Found the tortillas in the fridge, but could not find the chorizo. Asked staff for chorizo and they told me that they did not sell chorizo. Stopped by several weeks later and again I was told that they did not sell chorizo. Decided to send a Facebook message to the business today and they responded by saying that they do carry chorizo. Huh? So confusing! Don't they want the business? Or is it that the staff is not trained on what they carry?  Anyway, we really like the tortillas, so they have our business as long as they carry tortillas. In terms of the dining-in options, the reviews are so negative that I am not willing to take the chance and give it a try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in the Richmond hill area and we decided to try the food here. To our surprise the prices were affordable, so we ordered 4 crispy tacos, 4 soft shell tacos and a nacho supreme. Once we got home, we were so excited to try them and also very hungry!! After our first bite... The look of disappointment smeared our face. We've tried Mexican food multiple times before and to be quite frank this was beyond TERRIBLE. The nachos were smeared with guacamole, the burnt pork and chorizo sprinkled all over and the quantity of chips were inexcusable. The tacos (hard and soft) were cold with soggy rice, minimal meat, wrong tortilla for the soft shell (we asked for blue) and just all around disappointing! If there were a way I could have gotten my money back I would have!! Do not waste your money going there!"}
{"text":"I made many mental notes to check La Tortilleria out before we finally remembered to go there one night with empty stomachs. We've eaten there a couple times since and it always sounds like we've just missed a rush. We're never in a hurry though, so waiting for the very casual and friendly servers to replenish the stocks isn't ever an issue.  Between pointing at the hot trays and referencing the overhead menu, my curious constant companion and I have managed to try everything from steak, pulled pork, mole, cactus, chorizo and potato, and veg in soft tacos. On my last visit when they ran out of white flour tacos, I was treated to whole wheat organic soft tacos (which are not usually for sale). A candid conversation with one of the servers revealed that I am not just untimely after all, but that they almost never have guacamole in store.   The fridges in the back offer a rainbow of exotic fruit juices and both plastic and glass bottled Mexican Jarritos soda to wash your tacos down with. Don't forget to grab a handful of complimentary tortilla chips and slap some salsa verde on top of everything before you take a seat in the elevated seating area on the side. Although the crumby plate is often sitting empty, a polite reminder will guarantee that more will be on its way before the next Spanish cover of an American pop classic is finished playing.  I'm not familiar with many of the groceries that La Tortilleria carries, but besides the cute packaging, everything seems to be highly processed. My friend decided to try one of the fresh pastries last time and reported that it was not bad. I'll stick to my little bags of tortilla chips which are perfectly sized for making a single batch of nachos."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the bad experiences people seem to have had here! Maybe the staff have taken the Yelp reviews to heart (hopefully!) and made some improvements!   I've lived in the area for some time and have yet to make my way to La Tortilleria, even though it always smells deliciously of fresh corn tortillas when I walk by. I finally made my way here with a fellow meat lover, as well as a vegetarian, and I was not disappointed.   The staff were really friendly, the service was quick and the food was pretty darn good! I tried three of the meat variates, the pork, chorizo, and chicharrones (pork rind) and was not disappointed. My sister (the vegetarian) had three veggie options, all of which she enjoyed.   While the meat was well seasoned and delicious, the best part for me was the fresh corn tortillas - they are fantastic! Paired with a jarritos, it was a pretty decent meal, and all for around $10.   So why is this a 3 star review? I'll admit, I was hoping for some cilantro and sour cream - and maybe even a fresh tomato salsa (am I asking too much?) - but even without I can see another trip in my future!"}
{"text":"Blah, another Mexican failure in Toronto. (Why can't we start getting it right?)  Upon entry, this place looks okay. More of a takeout joint, but they do have a few self-serve style tables at the front and a small store area selling imported food stuffs from Mexico and the US (canned salsas, refried beans, hot sauces, etc) Place was very clean.  The food was very 2 star...completely uninspiring and really bland. You can get 3 tacos for $6.99. They have a selection of 4-5 veg options and 5 meat options. They all sound delicious in the descriptions, but they don't come out of the kitchen looking like anything special. The veg taco I tried (was supposed to be butternut squash, caramelized onions and some other ingredients) was completely dull. The adobe pork, again , blah. The chicken mole was the only decent tasting one and likely because it was slathered in mole sauce.  They also don't give you any fresh cilantro, sour cream or any toppings here. Just a few watery salsas in a self serve area.  Mexican Salsas across the road is the same price - MUCH better food."}
{"text":"La Tortilleria is a great spot to grab a quick taco on Bloor. The establishment suffers from a bit of an identity crisis as it is divided evenly between a taqueria, and purveyor of Mexican spices/sauces/tortillas.   In my humble opinion, La Tortilleria does a much better job with the former. I'm a big fan of the chicken mole taco in particular, and always end up getting one if I happen to be walking by.   Overall, a safe bet for picking up a delicious snack or a stack of tortillas!"}
{"text":"What makes the tacos here worth eating are the tortillas. They make their own soft corn tortillas and these tortillas are just about the best that I've ever had (big compliments since I'm from Southern California and grew up eating tortillas, rather than bread)."}
{"text":"There are certain hot sauces that must always be in my kitchen and this is the place to get them. Two bottles for less than $5? Sold. Mexican Coke made with sugar instead of HFCS? Gimme now. The store isn't pretty, it's very, well, Mexican. Selection is good but not as vast as I would like, you can get all your basics and maybe an extra or two.   Basically what you should walk away with knowing is that this place is cheap and you can get all of your Mexican favourites here."}
{"text":"I should probably lead off by saying: I've only been to Mexico once, so this Scandinavian-with-a-cholula-favouring-palate might not have the most solid credentials for reviewing La Tortilleria.    However, when I'm planning a Mexican-themed dinner...this is my go-to for staples.  In the fridge at the back: flour tortillas, fresh house-made salsa (which, if hesitant, you can test up at the front, too), Mexican crema and cheeses.  Juices, jellies, Mexican vanilla, big tins of hominy and bulk bins of dried chillies are also found here.    Of special note: an extensive range of hot sauces (ai-yai-yai!), with my standard pick of cholula going for a wallet-saving $1.99/bottle.  Ai-yai-yai, indeed.  It's impossible to ignore the fresh-made corn tortillas up front (white corn, yellow corn, and organic options).  They smell amazing, and - at $3.99 per kilo - are a great deal.  I proudly carry that steaming paper round of tortillas home with me, tearing off pieces as I walk (people look at me, but I can see: those are looks of food-envy).    Yelp note: La Tortilleria's corn tortillas don't last long at my house, though it's worth mentioning that they're good in the fridge, and come back to life quickly when frozen, too.  Impromptu taco party?  With just a smidge of forethought, La Tortilleria's got yo' back.  Muy bien."}
{"text":"I came here with a date one warm September afternoon to grab some authentic Mexican fare in Kensington. After a false start (we went to the old location), we made our way up the stairs in the larger-than-expected-but-with-not-much-seating diner.  It was a pleasant day, so after placing our order, we decided to take a seat on the patio out front. As we waited, a freshly-married Spanish couple showed up to have pictures taken on their front steps (did they share their first tostada here or something?), some apartment dwellers moved a shitload of furniture up the adjacent steps, a staff member smashed A LOT of glass on the front steps. I guess what I'm saying is: it was taking a long time.  When I got up to check, there were the tacos sitting on the counter. \"I didn't know where you had gone,\" the girl behind the counter replied. Whatever. I grabbed some jarritos and headed back out. The tacos were getting cold but damnit, they were good. My chorizo was almost as good as some that I have had in California, and the hot sauce it was served with was awesome. I'd come back, and just make sure to impress to the staff that we aren't going far.  Obligatory Title Pun: See you LA-TOR alligator.  Menu Readability: Bright clashing colours in a sign above the counter.  Need to mention: This place has the worst website I have ever seen. Don't dare visit it.  What this place teaches me about myself: I've heard of dine and dash, but order and dash?"}
{"text":"This place advertises fresh tortillas made daily.  This is a lie. They send them from a factory. Premade  without even a best before Date The owners Axel and Juan are the worst  Rudest ignorant people I have ever seen. They don't care about their customers. They don't stand behind their products.  They will do nothing to fix any issues.  They tell their employees not to tell anyone their names.  So again  Axel. And Juan."}
{"text":"Ordered off Foodora for this place, and honestly i was underwhelmed at what i got, the chicken in my tacos was very dry. I was downing glass after glass of water because of how dry my mouth was getting just chewing it. The tortilla's were also below average...   Dont think ill return here in the future, there are much better mexican resturants out there."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive, the place looks nice and clean. They also sell Mexican products (salsa, chips, tortilla, and hot sauce). Service was quick. They have different options for your tortilas: original, garlic herbs, spinach, habanero.   My hubby had a beef chipotle burrito with garlic Herb tortila. And I had chicken tinga burrito with habanero tortila. We both were disappointed with our burritos.  Garlic Herb tortila was interesting; habanero tortila was so so (tasted just like regular tortila). The quality of the fillings were poor. 1) the beans tasted like it was straight from a can, didn't have any flavour at all. 2) the rice filling was very bland. 3) both my chicken tinga and my hubby's ground beef chipotle were lacking flavour and quantity.  The burritos came out to be around $10 each with taxes. They came with a few chips and salsa dip of your choice .  Overall I was disappointed and not sure if I would return. There are hardly any good Mexican places in York region area."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!! They are thieves!!! Their cactus tortilla package says 36 tortillas and under it, 600 grams. Well, after buying 6 packages  I decided to count them because they last only about a week... sure enough, they only contain 28 tortillas!!!! I called them and they treated me like a retarded!!! They refused to give me the tortillas missing and they refused the give me a name of a higher manager. What kind of business is this. Are they trying to profit on their most popular product because the rest of their food is below mediocre????"}
{"text":"Took an old colleague here for lunch to catch up one day. The staff was great and food was even better. It was a Thursday so we went with their taco specials. The mole tacos were aaah-maz-ing! I also had a type of chicken-filled taco too but it wasn't as magical. It came with a generous portion of chips on the side. As usual, guac cost extra but oh well. It came in a little bowl made out of the chip too.  I need to come back here to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Basic mexicain food, nutritifs are good but missing meat. The nacho is big but is far from the best i had."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, of all my meals in Toronto, this one was the most disappointing.  My chicken tinga taco was pretty uninteresting, and the tortilla was pretty soggy by the time I got it. (It took a long time for our orders to come out.) The chips and guac were ok. Most of the tacos were a bit underwhelming. The quesadilla was wrapped, which I have seen before, but the cheese was barely melted. It was basically a big mess for my friend.   Two beers on draft. Light beer was ok."}
