{"text":"Great place, delish food and cool music, but they totally have to reconsider about the waitress whom they hire. It was for the second time I was there and surprisingly she's still there."}
{"text":"Had wings here last night with a couple guys. It was unanimously agreed that the wings were excellent. We especially enjoyed the honey garlic sauce. The wings were very meaty compared to wings I've had other at similar bars, like the Artful Dodger which has dreadful wings. In fact these were the best wings I've had in a long time.  Service was good and the atmosphere was fine. We were watching the Leafs game for the most part, the TVs are new HD TVs but the volume of the game was low, if on at all. Most of the crowd did not seem to be interested in the game so I would not really recommend this place to die-hard Leaf fans who want a good game-watching atmosphere.   Beer selection was OK, there were a few local craft beers, but I'd like to see more."}
{"text":"Let's be clear, The Rose is a local watering hole, that doesn't try to be too fancy or over the top. And that's what makes it a great local pub for the area.   The staff is friendly and helpful and are generally on top of their tables, unless it is late on a Friday or Saturday night when the bar gets a little too busy.   There is live music of different varieties every night, so it feels different consistently, though the live music level tends to be too loud.   This bar is at its best during the summer months, anytime between 4-8 pm any day of the week. Grab a table at the open window and watch the world go by. It's not too busy before 8 pm, so the service is exceptional and the place is comfortable.   You won't find anything too fancy on the menu or on tap, again it is a local watering hole with pub food, and sometimes simple is better!"}
{"text":"I recently created a Yelp account and decided to review Rose & Crown since I've been dozens of times since moving to Ontario in 2012.  Rose & Crown is your typical pub, with typical pub fare. Despite it's snobish Yonge and Eglinton location (I live here too: booo), the staff there is awesome and very friendly.  Great prices on food and drink, great atmosphere during nights with live band entertainment. Very casual.  Suggested: Rose&Crown Burger. Best burger in uptown Toronto. Yes: it's better than Burger Shack."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and it has a really great atmosphere. I've been to pubs in Ireland and being at the Rose & Crown felt very close like those there. They had live music and the musician was great. Good food, drinks, and service too!"}
{"text":"I should preface this review by stating that I really, REALLY want to like The Rose & Crown. Living a block away, I always hoped The Rose & Crown would be my go-to bar in the neighbourhood, my watering hole in the concrete desert that is Yonge and Eglinton.  Unfortunately, every visit to this bar diminishes that dream slowly but surely.   The first thing you will notice about this bar is the size; it's massive. If you sit at the back, you will realize everyone walking through the crowd from the front to the back will look like they just trekked through a labyrinth of some sort. Interestingly, despite the cavernous layout, it's really tough to find a place to sit if you have a party of five or more. Last weekend, they closed off the entire back section for no apparent reason. I asked a busboy if we can sit there, and he just looked confused as he pointed to a sign that said \"Section Closed\". Eventually people just started sitting there, and I wished I could only be as bold.  The food is below average. I've had their philly cheesesteak au jus, the fish & chips, the nachos and a bunch of other pub fare. You don't really expect great food from a pub, but it should at least be average. The nachos tasted like I was biting into an onion.  The service is also lacking. My last two visits were very frustrating since the waitresses were never around. One waitress asked why I wanted two additional glasses when my table of five already had two (filled with a different beer, no less). I guess they have a limited supply of glasses.  The bar can also get very loud. You almost can't hear the person sitting across from you when a band is playing.   During my last visit, they were handing out free bottles of Carlsberg. I thought that was pretty cool (until I drank it), but I also realized it was really strange since they don't even have Carlsberg on their menu.   I will still probably go to The Rose & Crown only because it's convenient, but only if I'm with people who know what to expect. It's not a place I'd recommend to newcomers, and I will likely never eat here again.  I gave it two stars: one for the friendly staff, and another for hope that it will someday turn around."}
{"text":"Great service and exceptional food, the live bands are entertaining while the overall atmosphere is great. Would definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"I really liked it. Between the three of us, we ordered mac & cheese,  burger, and wings. We all lovef the food! And i definitely loved my mac & cheese!  Food prices were also very reasonable. We didn't stay for tge live music but ive heard its good..so next time."}
{"text":"We cams here for a dinner on a Friday night. The pub is very well decorated and looks like a old fashioned pub inside. Reservation was over the phone and they honored it. The waiter was very kind and servicing. Food was also good. I had the chicken wrap and was tasty. Fries are also good but not the best I have tried though. My gf had a burger which I tried of course and it was good and big for the price. Excellent option in yonge and eglinton area."}
{"text":"This is the best bar in the Yonge & Eglinton area when you're looking for a place with ripping tunes. Everytime I walk by I hear the place rockin' and I feel they pride themselves on the fact that there's live music everyday, and they should. Great choice of brew and delicious pub fare. I would recommend the wings. Enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"They have the best pad thai in the city! All the meals I've had here have been consistently tasty. Love their fresh cut fries and veggie poutine option. They have a big selection of draft beer. And a great variety of live music every evening. The staff always make me feel welcomed and are very personable. I have met some solid friends at this pub and it is considered a landmark in the Young & Eglinton neighbourhood for the locals."}
{"text":"Been a regular here for 12 years. Used to be a very nice place with great live rock music. Recently though, they bring in inexperienced D- bands with crappy pop music like Adele & Miley Cyrus (Really Rose& Crown?!?) I decided to stopped going there. It's a shame."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some fun, beer and music on a weekend. Local staple!"}
{"text":"Right above Absolute Comedy, The Rose and Crown is a pub that seems to be targeted at two audiences - soccer/rugby fans during the day (attracts a bit of an older crowd), and the 21-25 year old crowd in the evening, though you can always find your token cougars hanging out here too (and who doesn't love a cougar).   The bar is actually 21+ seven days a week but the staff only really enforce it on Friday and Saturday nights, the rest of the time they let it slide.  I have been to this pub quite a few times and have always had a pretty good night.   The bar is big, bigger than you'd think with lots of room to sit down and a dance floor in front of the little stage where they have live music most nights of the week. The only pub bigger than this in the area is The Unicorn. The Rose and Crown has a very typical pub feel with bench seating, wood tables, lots of pillars everywhere and dim lighting.   The beer is average, the service is average, and the place in the evenings always seems to be packed. In the summer the windows in the front open right up so you get that nice summer breeze all the way through.  A decent choice in the area."}
{"text":"Generic pub in my old hood at Yonge and Eglinton. Has a live band, a dance floor and white people rock(Bon Jovi and Brian Adams). Never really been my scene. I've come here half a dozen times and cannot recall anything memorable ever happening."}
{"text":"This pub has a nice atmosphere very cozy old fashioned vibe. Very mixed crowd from people having an after work drink to young people enjoying the nice mix of music they play here. Prices are very fair and they offer a daily special from mon to Sunday. Easy to get to just north or eg subway right on yonge, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have never felt the need to write a negative review about any place I've been. But for this, I had to make an exception.   So yesterday, we were in the area for New Years and looking for a bar to just have a couple of drinks at. We were deciding between this and the Duke's Pub, a little further down. This place had two bouncers and a cover charge but no line. So we decided, we would try asking if we could take a quick peak inside to see if there were any seats available and then pay the cover charge.   We walk up to them and at the same time this dude who obviously stepped out for a minute is trying to get back in. Before he can even explain himself, one of the bouncers is already looking ready to kick his ass. But they eventually let him in.   Now, we explain what we want to do. I would have been perfectly fine with being told this was not possible. Infact if they had just said that, we would have still considered paying the cover charge and going in.   Instead what we got was some serious attitude. At this point, we decided that a place that chooses to treat their customers like absolute shit before they have even entered, wasn't getting our business.   We went over to the Duke's Pub instead and they were amazing."}
{"text":"We hosted a private event here! They closed off the back section for us, and it was perfect. You can view a show or have a panel for Q&A. Great spot for cheap eats and a cold beer. The Keith's draft is my personal favourite."}
{"text":"This place does as good a job of capturing the english style pub aura as any in town. By that I mean it has a \"lived in\" look & feel with none of the gloss you'd find at a place like the Duke of Kent next door.   On a weekend night it is a fun place to cut loose with a few drinks no matter what your age (nothin worse than feeling like a creepy old dude in a bar full of kids). You can get a little rowdy, dance, and talk loudly without looking out of place which is a good thing in my books!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for dancing - live music every night! It gets really busy past 11 so good luck getting the waitstaff to notice you or securing a spot at the bar. My friends and I always have a great time here. Generally the people here are late twenties to early thirties, but there are also some way older and younger."}
{"text":"I would love if a cool place like The Curzon, or Souz Dal would open up shop in midtown.  Alsas....this has not yet happened.  What is left is a copy of the Brunswick House.  If you are a college/uni student, this place is for you.  I have been here once, and whew, that was enough.  I had an older woman (she fit the cougar sterotype) stop me in the tiny bathroom to discuss the colour I was wearing.  Apparently purple is my colour.  When I sat in the back room on the bench (see above reference to the Brunswick House), I did see a bunch of young guys come in and do a scan to see if there were any hot offerings for them to hop on.  For the people watching, this place gets a 5 star.  For the fact that I am not 20 and am not hip to the jive of this scene, it gets 1 star.  Let's just call it an even 2 stars."}
{"text":"Come for the booze, not for the food. Guess the wiff of soured, spilled mixed drinks en route to the bathroom should've been a warning. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder and a large chicken quesadilla to share. The soup was watery, not what I expected of a chowder, and bland. However, it was the fishy, canned clam that tipped the scale for me. The quesadilla was presented as sloppily piled triangles on a scraggly bed of salad greens (entirely unnecessary). It looked and tasted like a stoned teenagers' toaster oven snack; the pita was on the verge of charred and the middle consisted of a heap of pre-shredded Kraft cheese with bits of chicken swimming in the calico goo. The place started getting busier as the evening went on, looks like a good, rowdy hangout for drinks, but if you're hungry make a pit stop at the Chipotle down the street first."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for a casual night out.  Crowd is mostly people who went to high school in the 90s, proven by the cover band they have on weekend evenings. I really like this place because it has quick enough service, a variety of places to sit (booths and tables) as well as a dance floor.    Enjoyed some sunshine at a window seat the other day and had some pad thai. It was okay, a little mushy. My friend said it's usually very very good, so I guess this was an off day.  They also have a semi-private room for functions."}
{"text":"I love this bar. Average beer selection, great service (they always know your order), awesome live band on Friday nights and some of the best times I've had out in midtown were had here. Cool that my parents used to go here in the early 80's too!   I know there is increased competition in the area (yonge/eg) but I highly recommend this spot- especially after 9."}
{"text":"Good for a night out on North Yonge St.  Pub atmosphere with a dance floor.  About 6 bucks for highballs on a Thursday, open late looked like a slightly older university crowd with a few older folk peppered about.   There is the duke of Kent down the street which seemed to be a little calmer and more quiet."}
{"text":"The place has decent food and drinks but the waiter we had tonight was very disrepectful and rude. We reserved a table for 12 people and we all ordered our food when all of us got here. Not only did the waiter forget my order, he also had the attitude to tell us that we were taking up room and should go to a library if we wanted to talk and chat. Please note we all ordered a dish of at least $10-15 per person. Despite the fact that the place was not busy at all, he also charged us for what was advertised as free refills.   At the end, he basically told us to f*** off and we were bad for business. I have never felt more disrespected as a customer till now.  I hope this is not the usual way they treat all customers but I know we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Hosted a large corporate event (130 people) yesterday, and can't say enough great things about this place!  - Cozy and charming atmosphere - Wide selection of tasty pub appetizers - Incredibly friendly and attentive service from staff - Johnny and Lisa were absolutely amazing hosts. Even when our large party showed up unexpectedly early, they were prepared and eager to make our night a great one!"}
{"text":"I usually come in here on a weekday after practice to grab a pint. Their selection of beers on tap and bottled is above average for what they charge, and the food is consistently good. The wait staff is very kind, but tend to be slow with checking on tables, even on weekday evenings (I have been here on the weekends when it's more crowded. Funnily enough, they are faster on the weekends).  The place is huge, so you can definitely come in here with a big group, and that may be the best way to travel into this place as it gets pretty rowdy after 10.   In general its between okay and pretty good, but the reason I'd say 3 stars and not 4 are the bouncers and the line on the weekend. This is a pretty laid back, albeit large pub, but it's a pub basically. I don't see any reason to have a line trailing out the door like it's a hot club, especially if there's room inside. I haven't been stuck in the line before but a friend was meeting up with our group (which had been there since 10) at about 11, and had to wait in line til 11:30, even though we had a seat waiting for her inside. It was a little frustrating. Also the bouncers were treating me like a delinquent because I didn't present my ID immediately upon reentering the bar (after stepping out to make a call). There really isn't any reason for that. i wasn't even drinking that night as i was the DD, and they were treating me like a drunk moron and said something like \"Uh, you can't just walk in wherever you want lady.\"   That is my only contention, and they aren't like that during the week which is when I usually go. But yea, the attitude at the door is a little unnecessary. After you get in it's a great time!"}
{"text":"So in the Yonge and Eglinton area, we've got limited bar selection, but the rose and crown has a decent amount if draught options and always plenty of seating. Also, as an added bonus, the food here is actually pretty good, give the chili and pad thai a try...pleasantly surprising.  Be warned, if you're looking for a chill drink with friends, this place gets pretty loud after 9pm as theres always live music (not always good live music)."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Rose & Crown on a Friday around 5:45 or so and was happy to find they had room for a group of 8 of us. The place itself is pretty cavernous as you make your way though the building. The interior is very typical pub style with some booths, some high tables, and some bigger normal height dining tables in the middle. Some areas are better lit than others, some seem incredibly dark but some people like the dank I suppose. Bathrooms are not exactly the nicest, and the sauce squeeze bottle of soap maybe speaks volumes in that while the place is clean enough to be non-offensive, it really isn't trying to be upscale.  Pretty standard pub beers to choose from at pretty standard price points. A pint of premium beer is just under $7 and a pitcher is $20 even. The also had some pretty good specials including 2lbs of wings and a pitcher for $29.99 on Fridays. I had a chance to try the wings, and the meat was good, but the wing itself wasn't as saucy as I personally like. Also tried the nacho's which were pretty blah, and a little too soggy from grease and salsa. I also had the Tandoori Chicken Wrap which was decent, and I'll say that their french fries are actually better than standard pub fries as well. The sweet potato fries and the accompanying chipotle mayo on the other hand were both a complete disappointment. It's rare that a plate of fries will actually go uneaten when you've got a group of people drinking around it. Overall the food in general was pretty weak, but the fact they accommodated our group and the food all made it out in decent time, it was slightly redeeming.  That said, shout outs to our server. He's the reason that things went smoothly and was helpful over the couple hours we were there even to the point of running out the door down the street to catch us as someone dropped an event ticket in the bar. Super awesome.  4 star service, 3 star building, 2 star food. 3 star total."}
{"text":"I come to the Rose&Crown usually on a Friday to hear a friends band play live, always busy but you can get tables if you go a bit early. Nice pub, reasonably price food and drinks. I have not eaten here but friends have and say it's good. Not a big place and if you're up to dancing nights with live music get the place going, although not a lot of space to dance and since small stage is located in the middle of the bar, can make it difficult to get to the front doors."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.  Adds extra charges onto your bill.  Gives attitude to their customers.  Forcing regular customers to spend more.  Have not renovated for years."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I've always had a great experience.  They have love bands and the atmosphere is bumping! Food is decent but I go here to have some drinks with friends and listen to the live bands."}
{"text":"This is a review for Rose & Crown for their lunch service  As someone who works for a large company in Yonge & Eglinton area - Rose & Crown is known for their Pad Thai - who knew?! There are at least three Thai restaurants in the area (Green Papaya, Spring Roll, Our Thai) and funny enough Rose and Crown easily has the best Pad Thai in the area.    Always came here for lunch for quick fix on pad-thai and it never disappoint! Service is very quick, friendly and price is very reasonable for lunch. Ambiance - well it's a pub, what do you expect?   It's a local and honest pub who is staying true to their character and for that - kudos!"}
{"text":"Went to Rose and Crown with a bunch of friends. They had the Monday half price wings special so I ordered it. Came with a bed of fries, veggies and some dipping sauce. The wings was okay. Not good not bad."}
{"text":"This is an all time favorite of mine dating back ten years ago when I used to work in the area.  It is an authentic British pub with the North American amenities - kitchen, TVs, and table service.   The food is home cooked, and their Pad Thai is a crowd pleaser-  rice noodles, peanuts, big pieces of chicken breast and large prawns.  This place has a back room that we always reserve for our football draft, and there are plenty of screens to watch the game.  While the beer selection is good, they don't carry any real craft beer.  I don't count Muskoka or Beau's anymore unless you are carrying the small batch stuff, which they don't.  Nonetheless, the food, service and atmosphere get the five stars.  Hint- if you like nachos, these are some of the city's best."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Rose n Crown for many years and I have to say that Johnny Rafferty the owner is one of the top guys in the hospitality industry and always looks like he is having a good time.  His smile & service is par excellence & so is the service of his team.  Even though I am an old geezzer I went several nights during the week for his live bands and I had a great time.  I tell my friends that the Rose n Crown brings in local talent who keep people dancing.  I have eaten lunch here with clients & sat at the bar and had a few pints and I find that the people that go to this pub, no matter what the age, are super friendly.

{"text":"Great pub with a nice atmosphere. Usually am here during the more quiet hours (Sunday afternoons) for a drink and a snack. Came a couple times with a large group of people and they were accommodating each time. We took over a large portion of the restaurant randomly, literally rearranging tables and chairs but they didn't even blink an eye. Very good service.    The food is dependable pub food. Prices are good and the food is comfortingly greasy. I always gravitate to the onion rings or nachos."}
{"text":"It pains me to write a less-than-glowing review of one of the area's only non-corporate pubs, but I gotta be truthful.  We arrived on a Friday night and the place was hopping. We eventually found a table near the back and decided instantly that we had to get the special: a pitcher and an order of nachos.  The nachos (\"corn chips layered with a three cheese blend, topped with lettuce, pico de galo, and jalapeno\") were a disaster, to be perfectly honest. It was an impressive looking platter but on closer inspection, it became clear that it was painfully lacking in cheese. A few of the nachos near the top had good cheese coverage but the rest of 'em were completely naked, which is just about the biggest and worst crime there is when it comes to nachos.  I mean, honestly. This is as offensively lazy as it gets.  I'm still giving The Rose & Crown three stars because I really like the ambiance and the service was above average. But c'mon, guys. Don't phone in something just because it's the nightly special."}
{"text":"I was genuinely surprised by overall appeal of The Rose & Crown. I was expecting more of a dive bar/pub atmosphere. It may not be the most swanky joint, but this place includes:  - friendly and efficient service - extended space to meet in groups of 10+ - relatively appetizing (albeit simple) pub fare - washrooms on the ground floor - a definite bonus since many places around here offer break-neck-steep stairs.  Sure -it's not fancy and it can get pretty loud, but the location is excellent and prices are decent. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Not much to say... Classic Pub with awesome atmosphere. Great place to drop by for a drink or pub fare!   Food always big portions and excellent taste and value!   Staff are great and service top notch!!   Love this place..."}
{"text":"There aren't many pubs in the Yonge and Eg area ( i think only 3 immediate, and then a few more when you get down to Davisville).  All in all, the Rose and Crown is the better of the immediate pubs. Good selection of draught, ok food, lunches aren't bad, funky keiths table right in the middle, live band plays in the evening, often gets busy by night.   It's a pub. Feels like a pub and looks like a pub. what more can i say... they have beer."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   VIBE  Not as crowded as the Duke.   I ATE  These guys had a really good Pad Thai here! Who Knew?! Way better than Lemongrass (?) up the street.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  If you need to b*tch talk your co-workers, this is the ideal spot."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed myself here.  Relaxed atmosphere with good drinks, great food and excellent service.   Pad Thai and fish and chips never disappoint. Arrive early to get a great seat"}
{"text":"A good place for after work drink, good space to accomodate large group, there is a pool table. Food wise not the best, I ordered quesadia and substituted the chicked with veggies the quesadia tasted more jalapeno than veggies there was a touch of vegetables in it. Nachos are okay."}
