{"text":"Just a tiny little place. You would miss it if you didnt know it was there..... superb chicken!! I would take out only, a bit dated and small inside. Chicken is herb roasted, seasoned to perfection and tender. 1/2 chicken dinner came with baked potato, rice, pita, two sauces and a salad. A huge amount of food. So worth ordering, i will have it again and again!"}
{"text":"Had whole chicken with salad, rice, fries and pita. O.M.G. The chicken was absolutely delicious! Tender, juicy, grilled to perfection. We will absolutely be ordering from there again!"}
{"text":"Just had the best chicken wrap I've had in a very long time!!!! Ingredients were very fresh and the garlic sauce is AWESOME!! Pita pieces are addicting as well!!!! The delivery guy was very nice and food came exactly when it was supposed to so I totally recommend it!!! My only complaint was not getting hot sauce but meh, there are way worse things in the world and probably saved me from some major heart burn. 
Thanks guys will definitely be calling you soon!!!"}
