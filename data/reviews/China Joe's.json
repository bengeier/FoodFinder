{"text":"Gross gross gross gross. 

My food tasted as if it were a few days old. The noodles were like spaghetti noodles and waayyy over cooked and the sauce tasted sour. I will never come back here. I am incredibly disappointed. I should have asked for a refund but I really did not want to bother."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious; service is great and it's family operated, meaning they greet you with recognition and warmth when you walk through the door."}
{"text":"Their mployees smokes in the kitchen. The staffs flip noodles hanging outside the food container with their finger. YUCK!!!"}
{"text":"I came in tonight I got chow main and orange chicken and it was so gross i do not recommend this place to anyone the orange chicken sauce was so thick tasted like it was a month old the chicken was dry the cow main was drenched in soy sauce and noodles where over cooked no veggies or anything"}
{"text":"Cashier could barely speak English that she messed up my order after telling her what I wanted repeatedly. Food was also bland and tasted old."}
{"text":"China Joe's is below average. I placed an order for delivery. They were late, the soup had spilled out into the delivery bag, and they delivered the wrong food item to my roommate. Also, they charge a dollar extra for shrimp lo mein and I got 4 shrimp. Come on!!! I don't believe I will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I asked for chicken fried rice and got beef. My friend asked for really spicy food and the food was very very mild. My second time here, but I won't be back. And I got a hair in my food."}
{"text":"They delivered so I was happy, but the food was fair at best.  They were very polite on the phone and when delivering the food.  In a pinch would order again."}
{"text":"Crab ragoons are very gpod pver all food too oily but hey for the price i guess thats what you get. Also not very friendly and small portions."}
{"text":"There is always free hot soup for us eveytime we go! We can feed our family of 6 with only $20 with their teriyaki bowls PLUS the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"So the real deal is this: delivery for convience it's good service. The food is average. The interior is needing a complete makeover if you decide to eat in. The Egg drop shop is not a good choice."}
{"text":"If I could give it a negative rating I would.  Absolutely the WORST Chinese food I have ever eaten.  I ordered pork egg foo yung from the lunch menu after I was assured I could get pork rather than just plain.  What I got was plain egg foo yung.  I would have been okay with that except I'm pretty sure there was not much egg in it.  No fresh onion, bean sprouts. etc.  This was certainly NOT made from scratch although the girl assured me it was.   It tasted like a pre-made, pre-pressed patty of .... not sure.... salty paste?  II tried to eat it as I was really hungry but no way.  What it lacked in flavor was more than made up for by all the salt.  Inedible!"}
{"text":"First time visit...usually I order from Yummy Grill Sushi off Eastern.  I ordered the mongolian beef and got about 6 fatty pieces of meat, a pretty big portion of rice and tons of white and green onions.  I called to complain and advised the cashier to call the dish onions, onions and more onions...he hung up on me."}
{"text":"I would give them no stars if there was an option for that. Worst China Joe's I've been to. The food was nasty and when I asked for a refund the cashier got mad at me even tho he saw how gross it was, then him and the cook started speaking on their language which is so disrespectful and then tried to make me feel as if I've never had that dish before, I've been to many China Joe's and I had never gotten such a bad service. Hand down worst location"}
{"text":"I will never order from this place again..the guy on the phone was completely rude and acted like he didn't care if we ordered from them or not..when almost 1 1/2 hours later when we finally got our order it was cold and looked like someone in the kitchen just threw it in a box and then shook it up....poor tasting food covered by globs of cold sauce ...I heard this place was shut by the health dept. twice in the past....I don't know why but I thought I would give it try figuring maybe they got their act together after the problems with the health dept. ..BOY WAS I WRONG! !!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just left! (July 9, 2017)  Very disappointed with the entire $30+ experience!  We were put-off  by the woman's attitude.  Our questions about the menu items were answered with an indifference and impatience!  

This was our second visit.  Our first encounter was also unpleasant. My husband received an order that was very spicy, but initially told it was not hot!  When he questioned the waitress she told him the order before must have been spicy.  The wok was wiped out, but there \"must have been residue!  They did not offer him a replacement or an apology.  I shared my Chicken Cashew with him and we did not want to create a conflict.  The restaurant is small and there were several other customers.

Why did we return?  We are new to the area and this place was recommended by a neighbor.  We thought if we reviewed what occurred on our first visit, we would not have any problems.  The waitress told us \"too bad, most people like spicy food!\"

We had a big problem!  I was served the chicken cashew.  Immediately, when I opened the styrofoam box it smelled burnt.  I did not want to complain so I added the brown rice.  There was a mild smell and tasted \"edgy.\"  My husband was served his order, a noodle combo of chicken and beef.  The chicken was clearly burnt with a strong burnt odor. He brought it to the counter and the woman rambled about the way it is made.  My husband said, \"I can not eat it.\"  I saw the burnt chicken and smelled the
contents.  I thought it is either the burnt chicken or bad meat.

After arguing, the woman asked if he wanted something else.  He ordered Cashew Chicken!  It too had a similar odor.  The flavor was different than mine?  He did not eat it, threw it away and we left! 

What is our recourse for this poor service and burnt or spoiled food!  We are 
still experiencing the after-taste."}
{"text":"I got two entr√©es and both of them were way over salted! The only thing we could eat was the white rice and crab Ragoon. I used to love this place but it's gone down hill after new management. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. Let's just say $25 down the drain o well lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today,service nice but food is terrible. Had basic lunch plate,noodle taste old and way to much pepper on it.chicken was ok but a little dry"}
{"text":"Just went to eat with my honey before he went to work. We went to a place called China Joe's based on its usually packed when we drive by. Well obviously the people in this area have no taste buds cuz the food was trash, slop, garbage. I ordered the garlic shrimp which was suppose to be spicy...wasnt spicy, was slimy, and the sauce was gray, the noodles were chewy and tasteless, they tasted stale, and the bell peppers in the shrimp had big chunks that had rotten spots on them....gag! To top it off we arrived at about a quarter to 3pm...the menu said lunch prices until 4pm. We ended up paying almost $20 for two which should have been about $15 according to what we ordered. Not sure if there is waiter service or not because as soon as we walked in the door a toothless man in a filthy white shirt handed us menus so we sat down. Then a woman comes and takes our order. She brought us our food and drinks. Turned out toothless man was the cook. I had a view of the kitchen and noticed rivers of water running down the walls over his cooking area.  I want to throw up after just a few bites of each thing...if ever in las vegas DO NOT EAT AT CHINA JOE'S. Contemplating calling the health department if I am sick tomorrow. We eat alot of chinese food and this is the worst in my whole life."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for pick up. My husband picked it up and brought it to my job. I recieved my food abut, I couldn't eat it. The chicken wings and bbq pork was dried out and old. They tryed to cover up the old dried up pork slices with teriyaki sauce. The rice was hard and the fries was cold.  They will never get my business nor my coworkers bussiness. I tore up the paper menus."}
{"text":"Eat here occasionally.  Never had a problem with an order or the servers.  Typical asian service, quick and no small talk.  We (GF and I) come for the lunch specials, a crazy amount of food for the price.  Here's a tip, 1 full order is more than enough for 2 people, so you can really save $ and get an appetizer.  I like there sweet and sour chicken.  I wont go as far as to say that this is AUTHENTIC Chinese food, but its perfect for a typical Americans idea of \"Chinese food.\"  4 stars all the time!"}
{"text":"They treat us like family! We eat there often. The kids love it as much as mom and dad"}
{"text":"I had them a few more times after my previous review and I no longer suggest them. Each time I received orders the quality was worse and worse. Tonight tops it all in terms of quality. It was completely inedible! We didn't receive our order just shy of 2 hours after ordering and being told 30-45 min. They are only a 5 min drive away from our home. I ordered chicken and Chinese broccoli lunch special that came with the egg rice and egg drop soup. The chicken was so bitter and greasy I had to share it to be certain it was as bad as I thought. If someone shutters and spits out what you give them it speaks for itself. The rice was a weird mix of gummy from old grease and hard from what I can only guess was a result of sitting out for a long period of time. I will never eat here again. It's a waste of time and money.
*Recap 2 hours on a Wednesday for literal trash."}
{"text":"Love this place they've got awesome chinese food!"}
{"text":"My order was charged on my credit card by EAT24 already BUT I was asked to scan my credit card AGAIN with the delivery guy! I asked him the reason for charge me TWICE BUT the guy said that \" in case of credit card fraud \" ! what the fuck is this ???????? I explained him that the restaurant will get paid by EAT24! and also I live 1 min drive from the restaurant  but it took 45 mins to deliver my food ! I used to like this place because they used to deliver in 20 mins even though they have bad reviews ...but NO MORE orders for them."}
{"text":"Terrible . I ordered 2 times online and every single time, sth was missing from my order .

Orange chicken was not fresh and it tasted terrible"}
{"text":"Food is good and cheap. I usually get delivery and it takes about an hour. Best chinese delivery place I have found."}
{"text":"This was my first time that I got myself caught in a home-delivery from China Joe and rather then being on time as I ask the delivery was 45 minutes early which under normal circumstances is okay but not when I ask for a specific time. 

The food sweet & sour pork was the most horrid I ever had..lumps of some deep fried could not identify something.inside..pork I'm not sure / my dog will love it tomorrow. Appetizer ...I have no idea what it was that I got  to eat ...shrimp chow mein...3 shrimps in the whole order and tiny tiny tiny the free bowl of chicken fried rice never saw a chicken or if there was to be one it ran through. Needles to say this was my first and last time I eat Chinese from a China Joe. All those who found it delicious scrumptious and what ever you name it....have you ever eat some good great tasty chinese food....?"}
{"text":"We ate here while staying in Las Vegas and was very impressed with their wonton soup.  We also had the Orange chicken, chillimint chicken and the general chicken.  The batter wasn't over thick and was nice and crunchy.  I can't comment on the restaurant because we had them deliver the food to our room."}
{"text":"While staying in Las Vegas working we stumbled across this place after coming down with a cold and needing some hot soap.  The wonton soup is the best I've EVER had.  They make it with lots of stuffed  wontons, shrimp, bbq pork, bok choy, cabbage and onions.   We also had the general chicken, orange chicken and chillimint chicken.  All of it was wonderful.  No heavy soggy batter just nice and crispy.  The delivery guy was pretty quick and very polite.

I would have given them a perfect score but they really lack when it comes to the lo mein noodles and the fried rice.  Very plain!  Don't let keep you from ordering thou, next time I'll order the steamed rice."}
{"text":"I'm not a Chinese food lover, although I do like to consume it now and then. And we usually end up eating something like Pandas because it's so close to the house, on the occasion we're too lazy to get out of the house we order from China Joes and get a delivery.  It was never my favorite place but convenient. However, it seems they have new management and have revamped their menu. And let me tell you,  it was delicious!  SO GOOD!  We ordered Mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork, beef and broccoli, house chow fun, shrimp with garlic sauce and house fried rice and for the starters we got egg rolls and cream cheese wontons. Everything was so tasty and had their own individual flavors, which when you order Chinese everything tends to taste the same, this was a nice change of pace.  And the fried food was NOT greasy!  
The person I spoke to on the phone was the nicest person I've ever spoken to from there, he wasn't trying to rush me off the phone which use to be the case and took his time making sure my order was just right. He gave a 40-45 min window and our food was here in 35. Nice, hot and fresh.  In a nutshell, if they stay like this, then no more pandas for us.  We can enjoy our laziness and order in."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the neighborhood. Food is always hot and veggies are not overcooked or mushy.Fried Chic apt.is delicious.You gotta try the honey shrimp."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 4 stars!! :) Friendly staff and great Chinese food for a very decent price.

I do recommend when ordering from this restaurant it definitely tastes better when you dine in as oppose to taking it home to eat...because the flavor and color can change once you get home. I rather dine in because the flavor of the food is just right. :)

As with the previous reviews written, the combo plates can be upgraded for $1 more if you wanted to add like BBQ pork in the rice...so I think that is reasonable.  Also, I don't think the cow mein is rubbery.  I think everyone has different taste buds.

Overall, You can't go wrong with fast food Chinese at an affordable price.  Definitely going back again!! :)"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this restaurant well over a year and today was the absolute worse.  First the order took over an hour to get to us, then the order should have been fried rice with orange chicken and was given steamed rice.  When I called they asked if I wanted to get a credit??? No, I want my food.

The other thing is I ordered the Spicy 4 Combination Fried Rice and it was not spicy.  The rice was not fluffy and the meat was overcooked.

Unfortunately, I will NOT be returning to what was once my favorite Chinese restaurant in Henderson."}
{"text":"Honestly maybe they just had a bad day. But everything I ordered was awful besides the steamed rice......
Orange chicken- undercooked 
Chow mien noodles- average.
Egg rolls- very greasy
Fried shrimp- still had the vein
Mongolian beef- practically no beef
Egg drop soup- just f'n nasty!
And a large coke that I never got :/

Trust me the place should just be avoided all together."}
{"text":"They are nice people. The place is...ok. The food in the other hand....not so good. I ordered sesame chicken had no taste and it was soggy. The rice smelled old too. I wish i had read the reviews before getting food from there."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!!! You'll be disappointed and sorry that you did! I went at dinnertime on 12/28/15. There were only 3 customers the entire time that I was there, and now I know why. Keep in mind that this was dinnertime. Most restaurants are busy at this time. First, I'll rate customer service, then I'll rate quality of food. I was standing in line when this rude, disrespectful, ugly chick with a horse face to match her long, black fake horse hair ponytail weave walked in, disregarded me, walked right up to the counter and asked for her order that she had called in. Not only that, but she didn't have enough money to pay and had to go out to her car for more money, then asked for more condiments as if I wasn't even there, and the cashier let her!!! The noodles of the Chicken Lo Mein were big, overcooked, soft and super greasy. The Chicken Fried Rice was old, mushy, soft and super greasy. The food was not fresh at all! The restaurant is dinky and dingy. You can't see everything that goes on in the kitchen. They could be serving up cats and dogs. Who knows? The poor quality of the food makes it overpriced. You've been warned. If you go there, you'll see that I'm telling the truth!!! This was at China Joe's-6126 W. Lake Mead Blvd, Las Vegas NV 89108"}
{"text":"Worst place ever... Horribe customer service will not recommend this location... I will not be entering this place ever again!!"}
{"text":"Their menu says they open at 11.  I called at 11:05, 11:15 and finally got an answer at 11:30.  The food arrived relatively quickly.  I had the orange chicken lunch special, which comes with orange chicken, fried rice, noodles and an egg roll.  The chicken was really low quality, all dark meat.  The orange sauce didn't really taste like much of anything, the rice was hard and the noodles had an odd sour taste to them like they had gone bad.  The egg roll was fine. For some reason they included a menu in my delivery, which had coupons that expired in 2013.  The delivery person was very nice but I wouldn't order from them again."}
{"text":"Order came quickly. Was disappointed with the crab Rangoon but the general chicken was pleasant. Pretty mediocre place, typical American Chinese cuisine. Should have stuck with ordering Thai food."}
{"text":"My first 1 star. I got the teriyaki chicken cause I find this dish hard to mess up... they messed it up! It was bland, the sauce was literally right out of the bottle and the rice was dry. This place would have gotten a 2 star if it didn't reek of raw sewage. Yes I ate there anyway... I was starving and my bike was overheating. Not one of my best decisions but one I will have to live with. I will not go back... ever! Kind of what you should expect from a place called China Joe's."}
{"text":"The type of Chinese food that hits the spot. Food was good and delivery was quick. Only thing was that there wasn't enough curry in the beef curry bowl."}
{"text":"Food was not that great. It had way too much cinnamon. Would not recommend this place . Definitely needs help!"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast. Delivery man was very polite. Typical fast food.  Tasty and fresh. I would order from here again."}
{"text":"Decent food but the absolute worst possible customer service.

We ordered Cashew Chicken and Broccoli Beef. We got the following:

One container of fried rice
One container of Cashew Chicken
Two containers of white rice.

Obviously someone in the kitchen accidentally mixed a container of white rice with our broccoli chicken. Mistakes happen.

When we called about the problem the rude man on the phone (who identified himself as the manager) declared it was impossible, that he had prepared the order himself and there was no possible way the order could be wrong. Strange, despite the impossibility the containers of food were still staring up at me.

And the \"manager\" continued that besides it was too far away to send someone out with more food to fix it.

WTF????

Guy got ruder and ruder until I blew a gasket and went on a two minute rant and then hung up. Mistakes happen, but to act like an axxhole that can do no wrong and treat the customer like they are idiots - there are far too many good places to get food in Las Vegas where they actually are concerned about taking care of the customer.

We ate the food - was decent for the price but not Earth shaking. Not worth the idiots and the horrid service, though. If you are not sure, read down the other reviews and the consistant repetition of bad customer service. I wish I had read them before I ordered. Call someone else, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"omg....horrible ....i got delivery from here last night , and it was all around bad . it took an hour and a half and i live 5 mins away , than the lady that answers the phone is so rude and rushes you to order and you cant get a word in edge wise , we finally get our food and we are missing the side items and the main entree is all veggies and no chicken , my order was the seasame chicken and it was so salty i thought i was having an heart attack just eating it , i had called to ask about my missing items and no one answered , so i called today and i let the lady know what happened and she could care less , i told her i wanted a refund and  she says for what ??? we were busy so thats why we messed up .....wow , i do not advise at all to even try this place . so mad about this ."}
{"text":"Super-cheap Chinese eats. I've only ever tried their lunch specials, which are a ridiculously good value. $6 will get you a couple pounds of food, including an entree, two sides (fried rice and chow mein), an egg roll, and a soup. I couldn't come close to finishing, and even with a 10 minute drive back to work my food was still roughly the temperature of the sun. Food quality itself was average, there were clumps of white rice mixed in with the fried rice and some of the vegetables were a touch undercooked. A lot of other reviews claim the food is disgusting and made them sick; either I have a stomach of steel or the beef & broccoli is one of their stronger dishes."}
{"text":"Just tried chocking down what this place called Kung Pao Chicken. About three pieces of chewy chicken covered, I mean absolutely covered in peanuts and cucumbers. Chicken fried rice also had the same consistency (chewy) chicken. Horrible, tasteless and I hope I don't have to visit emergency room later for uncooked chicken."}
{"text":"Had a 2 choice plate with beef broccoli and orange chicken. Also ordered won ton soup. Came out to about $12 for everything. If I was not in a hurry I could have made it paying less for fresh ingredients and better tasting at home. Now I know why they are always empty inside when I go to Yama Sushi which is next door."}
{"text":"We have ordered from this place several times and the food has been great every time.  We really feel the dinner for two meal combo is the best bang for your buck and they allow me to substitute my curry chicken in there.  Being in Centennial and not having much to choose from around here....I think it's a great option for Chinese food.  And the delivery time has always been pretty standard--usually 30-45 minutes."}
{"text":"God awful.  I hate to give negative reviews, because I feel like each business has its own merit (the price is good and it gives you a choice of eggroll or soup with the lunch specials), but it must be said that the food was extremely dry and bland.  Even the rice, which you already expect to be plain, somehow tasted even more devoid of flavor than usual.  As soon as I opened up the box and saw the orange chicken, I didn't even feel like eating anymore."}
{"text":"My wife and I got sick from the food prepared from this restaurant.  Cashier was friendly. However, the restaurant appearance looked like a boiler room operation. I don't know how they got there level or grade \"A\" in sanitation.  When my wife saw a cockroach run across the floor from the kitchen. What a waste of my money.  Horrible food. Keep yourself healthy and don't eat there. You've been warned."}
{"text":"$6.00 for mongolian beef, orange chicken, with fried rice and noodles, that's a deal in my book."}
{"text":"This place is ok, I've been here a few times to get food orders for one of my friends. Since I go here for my friend so much, I finally decided to order something for myself one day. I ended up ordering the orange chicken dinner combo, and I thought this would be something special coming from a \"real\" Chinese food place. When I tried the chicken I found that it had way too much breading, and it was too sweet. They also forgot to give me my egg rolls that came with the combo. 

Plus the few other times I went to this location, they make such a big hassle out of using your debit card. They wanted me to show my ID( which I had) , but since I had just got a new temporary card from the bank that didn't have my name on it, they wouldn't let me use it or a gift card that I got for my birthday.... Like ok, do you want the money or nah. 

If it wasn't for my friend liking their Wor Wonton soup so much, I would give this place one star. I would definitely rather eat at Panda Express than go through the hassle here."}
{"text":"This Is Probably the worst Chinese food place in Las Vegas Nevada. I ordered combination fried rice and 2 chicken teriyaki bowls. The fried rice tasted like it had been left out for hours.The Teriyaki chicken bowls were just plain disgusting they were soggy barely cooked pieces of chicken that got drenched in teriyaki sauce and had no seasoning whatsoever.Then on top of the food tasting horrible it took them longer than a hour to bring the food.Never Gonna Order Here Again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been eating here since I was 4 years old, that's almost 20 years now. The egg drop soup is to die for, I used to order the teriyaki chicken bowl until I decided to try the curry chicken bowl, which is all I order now. Never had an issue with food. Moved across town but I still make that 30 min drive just to have my China Joe's"}
{"text":"This is not the best Chinese around, but given the very short list of choices on my side of town (that deliver), China Joe's does the job.  We've eaten here several times - once dine-in and the rest delivery.  Here's the scoop:

On the plus side:
*Service is super friendly and delivery is quick
*Food is consistently good and hot upon delivery
*Sweet & Sour chicken is our fave - it's never over or under cooked and they serve the sauce on the side so it's not soggy when it gets to your door.
*Love the cream cheese wontons - and we always end up with a free order with delivery.
*Prices are very reasonable and they are not skimpy on sauces, condiments or cookies.  :)

The not-so-plus side:
*Hot & sour soup... It looked like jarred brown gravy with a few bamboo shoots. It also had a really strange aroma that I couldn't quite place but it was very unpleasant as was the taste.  Nothing like any hot & sour soup I've had before.
*Potstickers. I can't really complain about these because they really were pretty good,  but I wasn't expecting them to be deep fried.  I think my idea of \"potstickers\" is actually the Chinese dumpling, so I can't really fault them for this, just know ahead of time they are deep fried (and a bit greasy because of that).

In the end, whenever we are too lazy to go out and are wanting Chinese, we call China Joe's."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from here last night, and were blown away by the flavor and quality of their soup!  Also had an order of egg rolls, which were pretty good, but their SOUP ... Oh-Em-Gee ... Their soup won my heart and my tummy with the first spoonful.  

We ordered the Wor Wonton Soup and Hot and Sour Soup.  Both were incredibly flavorful, chock full of goodies and an amazing $$$ value!  The wontons were freakin' incredible and tasted like they must be made in-house on a daily basis.  The Hot and Sour was perfectly rich, spicy, dark and delicous, and loaded with eggs, tofu, mushrooms. If you have a stuffed nose, this soup is the cure! LOL  Their Wor Wonton Soup also includes snow peas, pork, shrimp, mushrooms, carrots, etc.  But the wontons themselves were what blew my taste buds away, along with the perfectly balanced broth!!! Next time I will order the traditional Wonton Soup.  Can't wait!

Seriously ... Try their soups!!!"}
{"text":"Great vegan options as long as you remember to ask for no egg in your fried rice. Delicious food overall."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out from here several times. Always very hot, solidly good. $24 for enough dinner for 4. We will go again. We like this place. Kinda blah inside, we have never eaten in, but that take out is solid."}
{"text":"Great food for the price, big servings. great costomer service. me and my husband ate here twice in a row it's good and glad I live close by!"}
{"text":"I used grub hub for the first time I had a Chinese food craving, grub hub was easy to use but the Chinese food was terrible.  

I doubt I am too picky about Asian cuisine but:

Sweet and sour chicken (blue ribbon recommendation by gh) tasted like it was deep fried yesterday and served today not crispy or fresh.  Sweet and sour sauce was runny and watered down and with no good taste.  Poured it over the chicken and it was watery and got the chicken soggy.  

Lo mein with shrimp: poor quality shrimp, noodles covered with garlic that is all you taste.  

Beef with broccoli: sadly the only good one but beef quality was poor, overall taste not bad

Pork fried rice: bland and poor quality pork extremely greasy.

White rice: very dry and old.

Please be cautious, consider other familiar chains like pei Wei, pick up stix, or even Panda Express 

Ps - my friends felt so bad for me they reimbursed me for the cost Bc it was just that bad"}
{"text":"The service was fast and nice, quick as well. But the quality of the food is definitely questionable. The lo mein was cooked in loads of garlic, making that the only flavor available. The generals chicken just was not up to par with me. It had a funky flavor, different than what I'm used to ordering from other chinese takeout I have gotten in the past. The crab rangoon was overcooked and eggrolls were mushy inside also. $18 for all including delivery and tip. I guess it just goes to show, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I eat there every week.  It's hard to pick what to eat to feel satisfied for the whole week until I order again.  Usually I also order here for special occasions like my Birthday and Chinese New Year.   I can't get enough of it.   Sometimes I even look into how the people of china order and see how it is similar to how we eat Chinese food in America.  I have to say it is much more satifiying if you eat they way they do.  That's why I eat here I love the foods authentic quality.   It's not even worth me making it myself becuase I couldn't even start cooking it as good as they do.   For my order today it took 30 mins and I even had to call back to pay cause I forgot where I put my money."}
{"text":"I do not recommend ordering from here. We put in an order at 7:40pm and it is now 9:16pm with no sign of our food and absolutely no phone call or apology. We had to call them to see what was going on with it. They told us that they literally had JUST made the food. For an order that was 45 dollars worth of food, 20% of which was tip but we were, I guess, not important and neither was our money. Cancelled the order. I would not recommend this place to anyone. If I could give less than one star, I would. They deserve all their bad reviews."}
{"text":"Made an order for delivery through GrubHub while I was at work. I left explicit instructions in the order to send me a text message when they were here so I could come to security to pick up the food. 20 minutes after the food was supposed to have been delivered, I chatted into GrubHub support who, after 15 minutes of trying to call them because they didn't answer the phone, said they dropped it off and tried to call. Because I'm at work, my phone is off, and I've got email alerts set for my text messages, which is why I clearly said send me a text message. 

So I finally go to security to be greeted with a dripping bag of food. The cheap and flimsy styrofoam containers they used had completely fallen apart, probably because they took hot as food and put it in styrofoam, which then melted. So, not only can they not follow simple instructions, they also use shoddy delivery materials that resulted in me not even being able to eat. 

If I could rate lower than a 1 star I most certainly would. This place is an absolute joke."}
{"text":"Never again! Forgot half the appetizer,  peppered beef all veggies mainly, kung Pow way to hot to even eat, only thing hot was the soup and won tons were mushy. Use to be good now I remember why its been awhile since we ordered from here."}
{"text":"Salty, incorrect orders, arguing with customer's at the counter and on the phone.  While i have not been treated badly by the employees here, I've been witness.  I just don't want it to be me on of these days.  

The foods ok, but nothing to rave about and clearly not made with love."}
{"text":"The last time I was here was 5 yrs ago. The food was good. Went back about a week ago and had Pork fried rice and bar b que pork. Both were tasteless and greasy. The fried rice had raw onions in the dish. My stomach ended up getting nauseous. Called to let them know and they acted like I didn't buy my food there. The reply was basically you paid there is nothing we can do.I will not be returning here ever again."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorite places to go. All the food is authentic chinese made cooked by chinese. The portions are more than generous with good prices. Visit this place you won't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"Oh, yuk.

Ten years ago, this place used to at least be tolerable, but any more I can't drive past it without sneering and saying, 'oh, yuk.'

The meat is low grade, no matter what kind.  The chicken is fatty, the beef is tough.  Anything fried tastes like oil and not like the food it's supposed to be.  Their sauces are so thick they're more like glazes, and the sugary ones will almost send you into a diabetic coma.  The rice isn't cooked correctly and even the fortune cookie I got last time was stale.

Add to the fact that the people working there are usually not very accommodating or friendly and that the place is filthy, and there's not a thing in the world that would take me back here."}
{"text":"Called to place a pick up order. I asked the lady if the dinner special came with soup and egg roll. She asked me what I wanted. I again asked her if the dinner came with soup and egg roll. She then asked me if I wanted the lunch special. I said yes if it comes with egg roll and soup. She asked me what I wanted. I  told her what meal I wanted she then asked if I wanted the dinner special I asked her what the difference was and she got angry and said ' what do you want?' I again. asked her which meal came with the soup and egg roll and that I wanted General Tso's chicken. She said  loudly ' WHAT DO YOU WANT?' I became frustrated and said Listen, what is the difference in the lunch special and the dinner special? She HUNG UP ON ME!!! Terrible I will never go there."}
{"text":"We discovered this particular China Joe's by mistake because there is actaully a location right behind our house; we ordered delivery one lazy night through a mail-in flier and discovered it was actually for this Flamingo location. I'm a huge egg-foo young lover, and theirs is AWESOME. We usually get that with lo-mein and chicken fried rice. They have coupons for free or discounted items on their fliers and we have never been disappointed. We now always order from these guys :)"}
{"text":"The food tastes good. The restaurant has the best service.My favorites are Mongolian beef, Kung pao chicken, and sesame chicken."}
{"text":"I stopped in on 4/7/17 and ordered chicken and broccoli. It tasted odd but I ate it just thinking they have their own spice mix for their food. Not even an hour later, I was in hell. I left work early and fought nausea the entire ride home. Maybe I had an 8 hour flu and my lunch option was just a coincidence? Either way, I won't be back.
Not cool, China Joe's."}
{"text":"I always try to hit up places I havnt been to so this was a random stop. also try to reserve judgement until I am completely done with my experience and only taking a quick glance at the rating because when you check in, you cant help but notice it.

So I walk in and look over my options. Their theme here is Chinese/Thai fusion. I see that they have lunch specials which is always good for peeps like me who appreciates decent food at decent prices. If you refer to my pic, the lunch specials are from open to 4 pm everyday. Choose an item from the list along with either Lo Mein, Steamed Rice, or Fried Rice. You also have an extra side option from a Vegetable Egg Roll, Cream Cheese Won Tons, or Soup (Egg Drop, Hot n Sour or Won Ton).

I went with the Orange Chicken (typical right?), Fried Rice, and Hot n Sour Soup from the 5.75 list. Keep in mind a drink is not included but I got water and it was definitely from their tap.

First off, I gotta say that the Hot n Sour Soup was excellent! Not too salty or bland and enough ingredients to round out the taste. It was steaming hot!

As for the entree, the Orange Chicken was crispy and the orange tang to it was good. Only thing I noticed was that some of contents could of been more consistent meat portion instead of extra batter.

Now for the Fried Rice. Wow. No, not the good kind of wow. The what the heck just happened wow. The Fried Rice was not the typical fried rice I was used to. There was like nothing in it. You know like peas, carrots, onions, etc. It seemed like they put a couple drops of soy sauce and mixed in a quarter of an egg. It didnt have much flavor to it. 

Total I paid was $6.20 including tax. I left a dollar tip on the table for the service was ok.   If it wasnt for the Hot n Sour Soup being so good, this would of easily been 2 stars. At least the the above mentioned was edible. Maybe next time I will just go with a large bowl of soup. Either that or risk trying another entree in hopes that the cook was just having a bad day at the time. Either way, I will update accordingly.

{"text":"The food is very good and reasonably priced. They have the best hot and sour soup made to order. The dining area is a little run down and the restroom doubles as a storage room. But we always do take away. Good food."}
{"text":"Just got delivery ! Wow ! Super fast ! Hot & delicious ! Highly recommend! 
Thanks china joe ! I have the flu so this really made me feel better ! Will order again ! And tell others! Sorry I didn't take photos everything was AMAZING & FRESH ! All special instructions fulfilled ! Worth the tip ! Thanks !"}
{"text":"Babe and I was looking for Chinese food on our new sidee of town. I came to this place years ago when I first moved to the valley. The food was sadly less than I remember. I had chow mein and babe had shrimp fried rice. Both items were very greasy, lacked flavor and had very little protein. We will not be returning to this establishment. There is way better Chinese throughout the valley."}
{"text":"Seriously the most gross food I have ever had presented to me. Omg we had bbq pork that was obviously microwaved. Was so smelly omg I'm still feeling gross over it. Food was ok I had orange chicken. And my husband had Magolian beef. We pretty much decided to throw away our food. Anyway. Never again. The walls of this place are grossly dirty. Bathroom discussing!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant the other day thinking I had found a fast Chinese joint nearby, and was disappointed. 

I was greeted when I walked in but then was ignored for almost 10 minutes even though I was at the counter and ready. The cashier even answered a phone call before even asking me what I would like to eat. 10 minutes isn't usually a big deal, but usually in that amount of time I am asked right away if I'd like a few minutes or not before ordering.

After ordering, I waited in a booth. It didn't take very long but I did notice that the place needed cleaning, but since it was my first time there, I don't know if it always looks like it needs to be cleaned (walls, divider, floors, everything). 

The cashier let me know it was ready, and seemed to be kind at that moment, so I tipped them a dollar and took my food to go. 

I ordered the chicken and broccoli, which came with fried rice, chow mein, and egg drop soup. Overall the meal was okay, I probably won't visit again unless I want to just stay near home for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Not top notch, but decent food, rice is sticky and chicken is moderately good. Only thing they do I hate is when you want to switch the egg roll for cream cheese wonton, they only give one.. ONE? Every other Chinese joint gives at least three cmon Joe!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it was bad.  The food was too salty and too garlicky, it was so bad that I had to rinse all the protein and veggies in some hot water to wash away the saltiness and the ton of garlic on it.  
The rice that I received was hard and I couldn't even eat it.  Such a huge disappointment and waste of money."}
{"text":"The positive: It's cheap.

The negative: The food is frankly in the Top 5 worst Chinese I've ever had.  Ordered the vegetarian lo-mein and the vegetables tasted old.  The noodles would have been okay, but the problem is EVERYTHING is so drenched in oil, it's like you're eating a plate of oil rather than, you know, actual food.

To put it in even more clear perspective, this place makes UNLV's Panda Express taste phenomenal.  And that's not a good thing."}
{"text":"ok prices, barely ok food, works in a pinch."}
{"text":"Ordered thru eat24.com waited an hour and a half after my order was confirmed. It says 45 min wait time. 

Ordered a dinner special and asked for little to no sauce and my food was covered in sauce.

 Food arrived cold (for a 6 min drive that's not acceptable). Defiantly not very impressed. And no the food does not make up for it."}
{"text":"I went here last night and felt ok about my experience. They were definitely quick and the food was hot, but the flavor of the food was a little bland in comparison to the other Chinese places I have tried. I will return in hopes the food was maybe just having an off day, but other than that this place seems to have good quality food."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the food is pretty good. I love their mongolian beef and cashew chicken, so delish, especially as leftovers cause you can reheat it on a pan and chop it up all together on top of some rice. 

But my main reason for 3 stars is because the store itself... smells. I'm not talking \"oh its just chinese food\" smell. It smells like a sewage blew up in a locker room. Is that place sanitary? Burn some incense, spray some febreeze, there's a dollar store right next to you, get some candles in there!"}
{"text":"I used to stop in a lot when I worked in the area, now not as much but I will drive out of my way for this place. Super friendly staff, good food. I don't what it is about the fried rice, but it's my favorite part."}
{"text":"Had delivery last night and really liked it. My fav was Generals chicken and pork fried rice was first to get eaten up.  Also ordered chicken chowmein and pork dumplings. I want to try this place fresh because the delivery was good i know fresh its going to be better.  I want to try the curry bowls next."}
{"text":"Very plain and not so great looking restaurant. But yr not there for the atmosphere, yr there for the price and tastiness of the food, which was both pretty good. They also have a self serve soup bar."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good, CHEAP, Chinese joint down by the UNLV campus that is actually worth taking a visit to.

I usually order take-out from this place ($6 minimum order, $1.50 delivery charge), and they deliver it to my job on the UNLV campus. The delivery time is pretty random, sometimes taking 15 minutes, and other times taking 30-45 minutes, but it's worth the wait.

I have always ordered the All-Day Express Meal, which gives you either 1 Item ($4.15) or 2 items ($5.15), as well as a side of plain Fried Rice, and plain Lo Mein Noodles. I usually order the Mongolian Beef, but the Curry Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork, and Orange Chicken are pretty good as well. Whatever you do, do NOT order the Teriyaki Chicken...it's pretty terrible.

Usually to push my order over the $6 minium, I order some Pork Fried Wontons (6 for $2.05, 12 for $4.05), and those are pretty tasty as well.

Not a bad place to eat at all, especially considering the limited options for tolerable Chinese food around UNLV."}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food I've ever had

8 dollar lunch special included soup.  I chose wonton. Had an extremely fishy taste.  Cashew chicken had exactly 2 pieces of a chicken like substance and rest was peppers and foul tasting carrots
Overall very bad
Place was empty and staff was eating in the dining room when I went
Annoyed they had to get up and wait on me 

Save your money, skip lunch whatever just totally avoid"}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 person special with chop suey and orange chicken. The soup was basicaslly grease with egg. What made no sense to me was that everything was very greasy except the fried appetizers. How is that possible? The flavors were o.k. but the grease was unbelievable. 

Jusdging by the filth of the actual store I'd hate to see the kitchen."}
{"text":"The only reason I give 4 stars is the fact that their delivery takes a little longer than the average place but my husband and I have ordered a handful of times and the food is pretty good. Our order is always correct, always hot and the drivers are always very nice. If you are looking for decent take out with great service then I suggest this place. If you get delivery, I would definitely order before you are starving."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood to get disgusted with making a poor decision to order chinese take out then China Joe's is for you. I must say that I have eaten a lot of places but never have been so compassionate to let other's know of a horrible dining experience I have had. Though we did not dine at the location but made the terrible mistake of calling this location for chinese food. No we didn't get physically sick to our stomachs but paying $26.00 mediocre food. #68 China Joe's Chow Mein which turned out to julienne sliced cabbage with a little onion and bit and pieces of chicken, pork, shrimp, beef and if all protein measures less than a 1/3 of cup with the rest being cabbage. If you're into spending $9.00 dollars for cabbage then  this is the perfect plate for you and your family. If you're looking for the smallest egg rolls which are very greasy then you have found the perfect location to eat and egg roll without chewing simply let it slide down your throat. Anyways if anything I've said has not hit home with you on weather or not to eat at this location then experience it for yourselves and remember that I did warn you about how bad the food was. By the way the menu online is misleading since no one has upgraded the site and the prices on some items are higher than what is be given on the online menu. Good Luck and remember do everything in your power not to eat here.

{"text":"It came in a timely manner that was the only plus. Down side to that is you can be starving and not want to eat it. The chicken was chewy and fatty. There was so much breading on it that you basically ate mushy sweet and sour bread. The generals chicken was also the same. Hardly any meat and overly breaded. It also made us sick. The rice and lo mien were okay. The lo mien tasted old like the vegetables they put in the noodles tasted bland and old. I hate leaving bad reviews. But i don't like spending 50$ and being sick and tossing it all. So hopefully I can save someone else the money."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, everything is fresh! Food is reasonably priced, I am a fan"}
{"text":"Ordered war wanton- excellent! First time here. Everything I ordered was fresh and hot. The cashier brought the food out to my car. I definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"I used to get takeout from here a lot. When I lived closer. It is really fine. Nothing to get excited about, but not terrible. I had the Pad Thai lunch special and it is nice that they use breast meat. I thought that it was too sweet and it is weird that it comes with rice. The fried rice is not great. Not bad tasting, just plain and not worth eating, really.   The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Writing reviews is not an easy feat. When it is a good experience and expectations or needs have been met, there is the tendency to give it an exceptional write-up as well. Am not one to skimp on writing or spending the money or giving it less the time and effort for anything in this world. If it means to do something right or good for the benefit of mankind's satisfaction, there is the compelling need to let it be known. Restaurants and food places have to meet a great deal from each person's hunger satisfaction as well as the purse strings that purchases the meal. 

Dined in this small restaurant next to a massage parlor in the shopping plaza at the corner of E. Flamingo and Algonquin Rd. in mid-April. Not many diners at that time. Menu is not extensive in choices. This restaurant skimped on authenticity of Chinese cuisine cooking, that is far from what one expects from Chinese cooking. For its cheapness in cost of a meal, it skimp or cut-back in ingredients! The noodles and fried rice were made of soy sauce and a little salt (maybe), devoid of the usual chopped vegetables and egg that comes with it. As you know it, the regular fried rice (or if it was for the combination meal) in almost every Chinese restaurant or in fast cooking or to-go Chinese restaurants as well, would make fried rice with the usual ingredients of chopped vegetables (i.e., carrots, peas, corn, or other type of vegetables are the staple to fried rice, isn't it?) and with eggs. Wouldn't you agree? How do you picture Fried Rice whether you know or not, or you are the Chinese cook? The usual idea and way of cooking fried rice is what anyone expects to be Fried Rice. The Curry Chicken tasted unlike curry with most likely the sauce itself came from a bottle of ready-made \"curry sauce\" or chili-curry blend. See photo (thanks to a diner who was gladly took a photo of it) and regard it with your eyes if having less of ingredients means to have such meal at a cheaper price of $4.99 is sufficient. Is it a great buy for a combination of 2 entrees with plain noodles, plain fried rice at $4.99? It was disappointing to eat through the meal despite the affordability. In all accounts, a meal well-made is satisfying irregardless of the price it is afforded to. Sad to say, as it is decent in price but skimp on ingredients! Would you pay for less of a meal that's presented in a cut-back of ingredients? Had to mention that upon questioning how the fried rice and noodles were made as plain as can be, the cashier or man behind the counter stated that to have the vegetables and fried strips of egg in the fried rice and/or the noodles, an extra dollar is the extra charge or cost to the meal, thus would cost $5.99 (cost un-taxed). Such a sinker! 

Expectation: the usual Oh what a decent price for a combination meal with fried rice! 
Upon receiving the meal: Two thumbs down! 
Rating: 2 Stars to 1 Star. 
Recommendation: Eat elsewhere for the price, the cooking, and the meal that is rrright!"}
{"text":"The employees are nice and the food is always yummy.  I like the chicken pad thai the most.  It takes a little long so call ahead."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good if you like cheap, quick chinese food.  I love the General Chicken.  You have to watch out because they tend to make it all pretty spicy.  The price is very cheap and they give quick service.  I would recommend it for take out not eat at the place."}
{"text":"In my never ending search for Chinese food similar to the et oats version I grew up with I tried China Joe's. I went with the General Tso's chicken. The chicken was decent but the fried rice was horrible. It was white rice with a fried egg and onions. Missing seasoning and. Good amount of soy sauce was lacking. The main item I miss was the egg roll. I grew up with a plump roll stuffed with pork and veggies. Call them what they are,veggie rolls or spring rolls"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. I have been coming to this Chinese place for years, it isn't the best but they are cheap and normally extremely friendly, however today I put in an order for delivery and let them know I was on a time crunch. They took an hour, I called them to let them know they need to cancel the order because I needed to leave. The lady on the phone caught a nasty attitude and said they won't deliver to my address again, so I paid for the meal... however I am not receiving the meal at all. I'm the type of person that pays for their debts, but that's honestly bs. I'll never order from them again. Beware!"}
{"text":"Just received my delivery order and this food isnt edible. Lemon chicken is way over cooked, teriyaki chicken is flavorless, and both chicken plates are bland. Lo mein and egg rolls are ok, but egg drop soup is horrible. My food was delivered 10 mins early and the driver was super nice, but it was a total waste of my money."}
{"text":"This is horrible. Got the lemon chicken. It's a patty of country fried chicken with lemon sauce. It's horrible. Took 20 minutes to get my food and the egg roll is cold.  I'm dining in. Save your money."}
{"text":"Soooooo good!! Awesome pork fried rice. Delivery available even though I'm 6 miles away. Will DEFINITELY be ordering from here forever and ever. Delivery was on time too! Everything tastes homemade."}
{"text":"I ordered food here via grubhub and I order 2 vegetable entrees (vegan) both of them were without any flavours and with egg when I was quite clear while ordering vegan! Never again as they send you what they want!
Very unhappy"}
{"text":"Somewhere between lackluster and bad is a spot called China Joe's. 

Got the lunch special with teriyaki chicken. Didn't ask if it was here or to-go so they assumed to-go and chose the egg roll for me instead of the soup. Whatever. Judging by the other reviews they were doing me a favor.  

The chicken was overdone and almost chewy like when you microwave leftover fried chicken too long. The sauce tasted OK but was too runny and most of it was in a pool at the bottom of the chicken. 

Fried rice was uneventful. Not bad, just meh. 

The egg roll was disappointing. Just a paste inside of a crispy roll. Refused to soak any soy dripped in. The flavor was lacking. Was like a fried gruel roll. 

The lo mein was a disgrace. Overcooked noodles with no seasoning. So bland I could actually pick up the subtle notes of the tap water it was cooked in. In fact, it just tasted like solidified tap water. I used some of the sauce left over from the chicken with a bit of soy to add something to it but all it was like was diluting sauce with water.

What a shame, I really wanted to like this place. Really close and really cheap.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Love that China Joe's!
Their delivery service is the best!
Their food is Definately not bad for the prices they charge.
Sometimes they get really, really busy and they do their best like all good businesses but patience is a virtue.
I've ordered delivery many, many times from them and the food and cost is always accurate."}
{"text":"absolutely horrible. food came fast..  ordered fried wantons. were way over cooked. pork was jerky. oil was old tasting. pork egg rolls were the worst I have tasted, maybe the oil. they forgot the fried rice. cashew chicken... yes 2 items. paper chicken was no flavor.. was mushy. how can chicken be mushy?  soup egg drop was OK. once you added salt. never order from here again. ever. was told it was new manager.. obviously not good one.."}
{"text":"First off, most of the negative reviews are about delivery drivers service not the actual restaurant. There is always a chance your food might arrive cold and that the specific driver forgets something or doesn't even check to make sure your order is correct. Which is why I don't order delivery. Do walk in to China Joe's and you won't be disappointed, the restaurant is bright and clean. I have gotten the orange chicken and it was great, both times. The cashier was friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. Next time I am going to try the Kung pao shrimp. All I can say is China Joe's is a good Chinese restaurant, nothing fancy just good food, I just wish the lazy people who complain about issues with their delivery on time, or accuracy need to realize they are damaging the businesses image, and not actually reviewing the food for what it is, Good!"}
{"text":"Hi Everyone,

With high hopes of finding a better Chinese delivery restaurant than China-A-Go-Go and China AAA, we tried China Joe's on Eastern for the first time on 3/9/17. We had every intention of posting a positive review for our first delivery, but never got the chance as we placed our second order on 3/21/17. Our first experience on 3/9 was pretty good with the exception of the 45 minute delivery wait time. 

We ordered 2 individual dinner boxes at $8.25 each, which includes 1-choice of rice or lo mein noodles,  1-side  dish and 1-choice of entree. My husband ordered the Orange Chicken while I ordered Kung Po Shrimp, which cost $1.00 extra [for shrimp]. China Joe's did not disappoint and made a great first-impression with [their] tasty egg rolls and lo mein noodles. 

We ordered again on 3/21/2017 - this time around I ordered Kung Po Chicken and my husband ordered Teriyaki Chicken. We both ordered the lo mein and added 1 full order of egg rolls to include extra dipping and soy sauce, with an emphasis on \"dont forget to bring chopsticks\".

Unfortunately, our entire meal was a BIG disappointment. The egg rolls were ice cold and \"blah\" tasting - blah, blah, blah... AND the chicken on both entrees was so tough that we had to chew, chew, and keep chewing just to get thru our meals lol. We only ate enough to satisfy \"our hunger pangs\", then threw the rest away in the garbage can -  which meant, NO Chinese leftovers for breakfast or lunch the following day - a total bummer :(. Also, my driver forgot to bring our chopsticks, IS a big part of the dining experience in my opinion. 

We did not bother to call and complain. To be frank, I am growing very tired of the lack of consistency and subpar food when it comes to delivery and takeout dining. We've decided to simply move past this bad experience and continue our quest to find a suitable Chinese restaurant that delivers quality food in our area.

Since our first dining experience with China Joe's was favorable, we gave them 2 stars. As for our 2nd visit, we reluctantly give China Joe's 1 star as the Yelp site does not offer patrons the ability to rate a company at zero stars or below.   

[Post script] -  I just learned that China Joe's uses third-party delivery companies such as GrubHub to deliver its food orders. Since I live only a few blocks away, it now makes sense why both deliveries took over 45-minutes for delivery."}
{"text":"I moved back to east side a year ago, actually I'm still trying to find my way around these parts once again.  It's coming back slowly, coming from ChinaTown area you don't have to search heard for AWESOME take out.  You have more than enough choices, so looking through YELP as I often do, I came across China Joe's.  Now looking at the reviews I was kind of weary, but this is YELP and we all have different opinions, hence the end of all my reviews read the same \"but this is just MY opinion, try it out for yourself and see what you think\"  (ok, well most of my review have that ending)

I always go for \"my USUAL\" when trying new places, if you cannot get USUAL correct, I don't want to try anything else in you restaurant. So my universal USUAL is orange chicken and chow mien/fried rice.  Very simple, no need to complicate the basic.

I ordered through YELP, you can set the time that you want to pick up your order. SUPER convenient. Now the 4star rating is solely based on food and service HOWEVER I would like to ass this little tidbit.  The PARKING LOT is very crowed, China Joe's is located right next to YamaSushi, so after a certain that parking stays PACKED and you may need to circle around a couple times before you actual find a parking space.  If you don't mind parking close to the bank, cvs or the far end of the parking lot (close to flamingo) then you good.  Me myself personally, I don't mind parking wherever, my legs work PERFECTLY!  ok enough about that

Dinner special is only like $10, very reasonable and you get a lot of food, enough to split with another, or take for lunch the next day.  And there's always daily specials posted right next to the register and that's a damn good deal too.  Last night I paid $8.11 for Honey Shrimp, Fried Rice and Egg Roll, ijs not too shabby and yep when I get home today I SMASHING THE LEFTOVERS but I digress...ORANGE CHICKEN

ORANGE CHICKEN
Decent pieces of chicken, not too big and not little chicken nibblets.  Its dressed in sauce, a little heavy but I like it that way, so that was a PLUS in my a book.  You can taste all 3 parts of the entree 1) chicken 2) breading 3) sauce and no one did not take over the other, it was well balanced.  Chicken super tender and moist, breading NOT soggy w/ a tiny crunch and sauce not sticky to where your teeth are not sticking together but SAUCED. Yum, yum, yummy...

FRIED RICE (combo w/ egg)
JUST RIGHT! not gummy, not overpowered with soy, FILLED with chicken and egg, every bite you either have rice and chicken or rice and egg, or a bit of all 3 chicken, rice and egg. No super greasy and NO you cannot taste the MSG. Lol

Since my 1st visit last year, this has become or GO-TO spot for chinese food.  I have also tried
- Shrimp Fried Rice (AWESOME, huge pieces of shrimp, and they give more than 3pcs, ahahahaa)

- Beef Broccoli (AWESOME, crunchy pieces of broc and tender pieces of beef, sauce ON POINT)

- Pad Sew (is that how you spell it? anyway, noodles aldente, even ratio of sauce-noodles-beef-veggies

I figured if I start to order the daily specials, I can hit the entire menu at a fraction of the price. Just a thought

No big GLITZ job as for decor, chairs and table and a soup bar.  It looks like a family owned place, last night when we were there, they had their younger sons/nephews angering phones, taking orders.  I was tempted to send my nephew back to work an hour or two.

Go eats here, don't let the reviews discourage you....but this is just MY opinion, try it out for yourself and see what you think."}
{"text":"NOT VERY GOOD. not good at all. got the wontons based on yelp reviews. are you fu#king kidding me??? those who recommended these wontons should never be allowed to review or rate anything anymore. royal chicken was gross, fried rice is not your typical fried rice, not sure what this is.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS. DO NOT GO HERE!!! the end."}
{"text":"The two stars on here are true ... the food is awful and the place is awful really bare.
Nothing on the tables.  Very sad.  You have to ask for everything.  It's all
Behind the counter.  
The food sucked bigly.  I had chicken with eggplant.  The rice and the noodles we're basically tasteless.  
Save your money or go to China One, much better."}
{"text":"I agree that it's not bad, and for a starving college student like myself, you can't beat the price! 
I had the General Chao's chicken meal deal thingy, they give you a lot of food for cheap and it's not bad mannnn... $5.45
So if you're in the hood, (a.k.a. UNLV) lookin for somethin good, try China Joe's."}
{"text":"Gross for so many reasons. I was warned.  No money back. View the real photo of chicken egg foo young for $8.99."}
{"text":"China Joes Chinese Take-Out.. Not Bad but nothing special.

Chicken was good,rice was good,egg rolls were good but it needed some MSG or something a little bland for my taste.

Feed a family of 4 for $30! The ribs I will pass on next time."}
{"text":"I just called to place an order.. I was put on \" hold\" yet I can hear everything then when the worker comes back to the phone I'm asked \"what would you like to fu***ng order\" like who runs this damn place?! Your customer service is garbage and your staff needs to learn how to speak to people. Not cool at all & y'all are one of go to places for Chinese. I guess the owners son was the one who took the call so watch out for him."}
{"text":"Solid take out that delivers in less than 40min to most paradise residents. Fried rice and chow mein was good, ordered the Mongolian beef and was disappointed as it was mostly veggies and meat wasn't that tasty.  They have good family meals for affordable prices as well."}
{"text":"Being from back East, I'm very picky about my Chinese food.  I love China Joes wonton soup and potstickers.  I got the shrimp fried rice and it was decent, it's been better. I ordered Shrimp Lo Mein for  the first time, it was meh. The food is always hot when I get it delivered and the drivers are really nice."}
{"text":"Not the best but does the job.

I live all the way out by Lake Las Vegas so my delivery options are not huge but on random Chinese delivery cravings China Joe's does the job, The people on the phone are always nice foods decent noting special. Their Generals chicken is good but they put it in a styrofoam box and it's a really hot food so the box looks melted when it gets to you not a big fan of that. I'll probably order from them again, hopefully i remember to tell them no styrofoam boxes."}
{"text":"My family and I come here quite a bit, and Ive even gotten some of my co workers going there. Usually the food is pretty good, its hit and miss, but today.. I made an order and it was gritty and tasted horrible. I called to inform them and they were rude and very abrasive. The lady that answered even hung up in my face. I returned the food to have them make another, which the new order of my rice was over processed and it still tasted horrible. The lady at the counter was very unprofessional and didnt even offer an apology for the mistake. This was a complete waste of my gas, $10.00 and time.. I hate to say, I will probably never return to this place and I will have to let my loved one know of my experience. I dont want them to experience the incredibly disrespectful behavior and nastiness I received today.."}
{"text":"Good food :) The food delivery came fast and the food is very tasty I would definitely recommend this place because it is cheap and very good I'm going to order the family combo right now as we speak"}
{"text":"I have really, really mixed feelings about this place. I mean, you can't deny that feeding a large family with Chinese food for like $40 is a pretty good deal. Plus they seem to make the food when you order it, so that's cool, too. But here's the rub: the food isn't the best!

I've come here on a few occasions where I've got family coming over to my house and I need to produce food on the quick. Since some people in my family are not cool with pizza, I usually run to a place like this to load up. So when I come here, it's not because I'm hungry or I want to eat here -- it's more like \"I need to feed five humans!\" To that end, this place is cool! Like I said before, I've been able to feed everyone, and have leftovers, with about $40. That's a good deal in my book when you consider the amount of feed they/we eat, plus the leftovers. I usually have enough for dinner later that night, and maybe even breakfast/lunch the next day. See, the food there is inexpensive. Plus they have these coupons they give you where you get free rangoons or rice or whatever after you spend a certain amount (I think it was $25 and $30, respectively). 

The downside is that the food sometimes takes longer than I'd like. I guess that's what happens when you get your food made to order, but still. Also, the food there isn't really as Chinese as I'd like it to be. By that I mean that a few of the items I've had (strawberry chicken, orange chicken and sweet-and-sour pork) seem to be really the same dish with a different protein. With the chicken, they use this fried-up chicken balls and throw some sauce on the top. Seriously. I can do that at home for like 1/3 the price. Really you get the same chicken with a different sauce. Not the business. I guess a lot of other restaurants do the same thing, but come on, guys. Step it up. I'll pay an extra few bucks for better chicken. 

All in all, will I return here? Yes. My mom loves this place, it's cheap, and it's close to home. I cannot beat the convenience afforded by this place."}
{"text":"I was shocked reading through the reviews for China Joe's. I've been ordering from China Joe's off and on for at least 15 years and never had a bad food experience. In fact, I consider it some of the best Chinese Take-Out I have found in Las Vegas. Love the food. 

Some of my favorites: Mongolian Beef, Curry Beef, Ta Chuan Beef, Twice Cooked Pork, Pork Hot Garlic Sauce, Curry Chicken, Hot Spicy Chicken,"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Las Vegas and are pretty picky about our Chinese food.  This was the third place we've tried and it's def our favorite!  We got the appetizer sampler, chicken fried rice and chicken lo mein. Most of it was really good.  I didn't care for the lo mein or the ribs.  Next time we'll get chicken fried rice,  chicken wings,  chicken fried won tons and cream cheese win tons.  Unfortunately they were out of the chicken satay but they gave us extra chicken wings to make up for it which are amazing.  The home made sauce they serve is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I have stopped going here.  As you can see from my last review, I used to love it, but the quality has gone downhill FAST. Too bad.  So hard to find good Chinese food in my part of Henderson :(  Smells like dirty mop water as soon as you walk-in.


Best chinese fast food in Henderson.  I have been coming here for 8 years and my favorite item on the menu is the Wor Won Ton soup. My husband loves the General Chicken and the Chicken Fried Rice is also excellent.  
What I particularly like about China Joe's is that they do not bury everything in thick, pasty sauces.  The sauces are good, but the food does not drown in them.
It is very casual dining and I always carry-out.  China Joes also delivers to my area which is an extra bonus.
The facility is clean and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food and service was lacking. It took 25+ to get my order and when I got home the food was bland. String beans were chewy and waxy, walnut shrimp has drenched in the sauce. I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Despite what people say about China Joe's, I used to love ordering from them. I would get their Curry Chicken lunch special and be perfectly happy. That was about ten years ago.

Fast forward to now. China Joe's has gone through ownership changes and they haven't had Curry Chicken on the lunch special menu for several years. As a result, I pretty much never go there anymore. For some reason, I decided to get lunch there today. Being a General Tso's Chicken fan, I went with that ($5.25). It smelled amazing as I was driving back to the office, but when I opened the container, it just looked off. The sauce for the chicken was way too dark, like they just threw a ton of soy sauce into the mix. It actually tasted OK, but definitely not like the GTC I was hoping for. Appearance affects taste almost as much as smell and something just didn't seem right in my mind.

It may be unfair to dismiss them based on one dish, but I don't think I'll be returning (at least for another few years). In a way, I'm glad. Having one less option to choose from makes the lunch decision ever-so-slightly easier."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Ate three bites and had to stop it was so bad. Avoid this place like the plague!"}
{"text":"3 Stars = B-

   China Joe's in the Flamingo at Maryland Albertson's Shopping Center, is most likely a \"I've experienced it move on\" check-in. It was okay. 

    On my way to the Clark County Main Library, I was up to trying a new spot for a lunch special. It was time to give this China Joe's a try. When I looked at the lunch specials on the window, instantaneously I was decided on New York style chicken chow mein. 

   When I stepped inside, I entered a decent size restaurant with a take out environment. Nothing cozy or fancy.

   When I ordered at the counter, their was a slight language barrier when I ordered the lunch special New York style chicken chow mein. Finally I just said \"L-4.\" With a fountain beverage, the lunch special came close to $9.

  Contrary to last Saturday's 2.5 star experience at the Rhodes Ranch China Go Go, the food did not arrive at my table in seconds. It took at least 15 minutes for the food to arrive. In a way, this is a good thing because it gives me some confidence that my food is being cooked from the time I place the order. But, where was the soup that is supposed to come with the soup?

  After the woman placed the tray with the  styrophone box, a spring roll, and fortune cookie on the table, I saw a couple of surprises. This did not look like New York style chicken chow mein. Oh hell no! New York Chinese Restaurant and China Garden is true New York style chow mein. The entr√©e in my opened styrophone box looked like chow fun with chicken. Oh well! I'd eat it with my taste buds in agreement that it was okay at best. The second surprise was that the fried rice that is supposed to be included was air. This is the first time that I ever dined in a Chinese restaurant where the entr√©e filled the dish (styrophone box here). In a strange way this is good because when the entr√©e covers the depth of the styrophone box, there is no filler. Then again, this is like going to an Italian restaurant and ordering veal parmigiano with pasta and getting a dish full of veal parmigiano. Ultimately, what happened to the soup that was supposed to have been included? I walked to the counter to ask the woman working here. She pointed to a table with self service soup. I am thinking to myself, \"wouldn't be the slightest bit helpful to the customer to know that they have to serve themselves the soup?\"

   This China Joe's made 3 stars barely by a hair. And speaking of hair, there was none in my food. The dining area of the restaurant was clean. Cleaniness is the wildcard influencing the 3 star rating. 

  There are so so many restaurants to dine in and try in the Las Vegas valley. In my case, this China Joe's gives me an infinitesimal incentive to return."}
{"text":"China Joe's is in my neighborhood. So, occasionally I eat there. Usually during the lunch special, which ends at 4 pm.
 From my experiences China Joe's rates on the tier of okay. On a previous visit, I was not enthralled by the shrimp with lobster sauce. On this visit, I was not enthralled by the spicy eggplant. On previous visits the spicy eggplant was tasty. The wonton soup could of used an additional wonton or two.
  The lunch special costs approximately $6. Compared to China Garden and Chop Stix, a fountain drink is not included for dine in guests. An additional $2 will substitute wonton soup for egg drop soup. 
  Ambiance? China Joe's has a take out ambiance. 
  Return factor: It is near my house, so I'll probably return."}
{"text":"I ordered the walnut shrimp with fried rice. The shrimp they gave me were pretty big. I felt like there was a lot of breading though. It wasn't really that great. The fried rice had a weird taste to it. Overall, the food was okay. I couldn't finish everything. 

The lady who answered the phone was nice. It was kinda hard to understand her though. The guy who delivered was friendly."}
{"text":"Besides being dirty in the front, which makes me think the back must be even more filthy (Can't belive the health department lets them get away with such filth), it's some of the funkiest,nasty fake Chinese I've ever had...and I'm almost 60.
Just awful. Don't bother.You'll be genuinely grossed out. The flavors suggest the cook u uses the same pan for every dish, doesn't  clean up after each order.So, you taste seafood in a chicken order,and something almost chemical."}
{"text":"This place needs a whole new interior makeover. The food was pretty average as far as these mom and pop restaurants go.  The prices are fairly reasonable.  The proportions are massive so come here with an appetite or be prepared to bring home some leftovers.  I loved how it was cozy inside with only a few people.  Somebody recently opened up a new Chinese restaurant a block away so less people are eating here now.  Before that this Establishment used to be a lot more packed.  It's still the same great food but now without the long lines to wait in.  So it can be pretty advantageous for folks who are in a hurry to go somewhere and they just want to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Heh I used to go to Joes all the time since it was across the university but I had poor taste and little money back then. Come to think of it, it hasn't changed that much. Ba da bup. The food has not changed much either. It's salty. It's over cooked usually. But if you are hungry it tastes pretty good. The prices are pretty cheap and right up there with a meal from McDonalds. I don't know, they probably cook better than Panda Express if you ask me. Consistency wise, Panda has it. I like the beef and green beans from Joe's. If you want some cheap and quick Chinese, without going to the restroom afterward, Joes is the place to go. Overall they are not terrible. Seriously what do you expect for $6? Try getting that at a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered food. A half hour after I ordered a nice lady called. She asked which hotel I was at I told her She told me they would not deliver to the room. I feel if you charge a delivery charge and you get a tip in your order form you should deliver."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese Food Ever!!!

I would give 0 stars too if I could. The delivery man was literally incompetent. He kept calling because he kept getting lost. Then when he finally delivered the food he forgot to ask to make a copy of my credit card. Then when I got back to my room he called again saying he forgot to make a copy of my credit card and asked me to come back down to the lobby (I was staying at a hotel). On my way down I realized I had a missed call and voicemail (this is all within 3 mins btw). The voicemail was the DELIVERY MAN yelling \"WHAT THE F***\" to me!!! I called him back when I got back to the lobby and he said he already left and laughed when I asked why he left that message!

The delivery man was very rude, yes. But what was worst was the food! The lo mein tasted like cardboard. How you screw up lo mein is beyond my comprehension. The only almost decent thing was the hot and sour soup!"}
{"text":"So they slipped a menu under our apartment door so we gave them a shot. We got delivery and delivery was pretty prompt so things were starting out well. The food was okay. Not the worst Chinese food we've had in this city. Unfortunately while eating the pork fried rice I came across some shrimp. If you like shrimp this would probably be a pleasant surprise...Unfortunately for me, I am allergic. As my wife finished off the leftovers there were several pieces of shrimp mixed into our pork fried rice. 

This is basically an unacceptable mistake in my mind. Good thing I was prepared with my allergy meds. The search for decent Chinese food in Las Vegas continues...Would never go back again as this mistake could kill someone. It suggests either they dont know what they are doing or they recycle old fried rice to cut corners."}
{"text":"Uhm Puke - How many china men you know named Joe? Ok I like Chinese food. YES CHINESE FOOD. Not this guy's interpretation of Chinese food. Is this art?"}
{"text":"This place isn't given enough credit. I just love the family who run this place. We are always welcomed. I get tea a lot, while waiting for my daughter to take a class,.but I've gotten take out plenty of times. I've never really been disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in today and ordered lunch. Ordered 2 lunch specials and an order of fried rice to go. When my order was ready, I was handed only 1 lunch special and order of fried rice. Cashier was rushing like there were 50 customers waiting in line. Mind you we were the only ones there. However when I got home. The lunch special was wrong. I called to complain and cashier told me she can not do anything. Last time I'm eating here!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever had.  The Orange Chicken was coated in a thick sticky goo.  The Teriyaki Chicken was fatty and tendony, and the Egg Foo Yung was no good.  The fried rice had no egg or vegetables and the fortune cookie was stale.  The only good thing on any of our three plates was the noodles (which also had zero additions, just plain noodles.)  If I ever had to eat here again, I'd try a Lo Mein meal."}
{"text":"I stayed on the west side of las vegas and would eat at the China Joes on Lake Mead and Jones .. so I moved to this side of town thinking  this would be similar. My service was rude the rice was over cooked and my Kung pao chicken tasted like plastic teriyaki chicken. The egg roll I recieved was old :(. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Woah woah woah, this place is like okay. Not as awful as everybody says here on yelp. 
I once walked into this location and had a man yell at me because I said the name, \"China Joe\", he thought I was being racist because a chinese guy had to be named joe. 
But, its in an awful side of town - but the food is good enough to eat kinda. Their rangoons are FANTASTIC and I could live off them."}
{"text":"Couldn't fault them. Spring rolls were good. Sesame chicken extremely good. The pad thai was yummy but could have done with a bit more flavor and the cashew chicken could have done with a few more cashew but overall it arrived hot and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Don't lie to your customers when you forget part of their order. I've never heard of a Chinese restaurant being out of chopsticks... when I called they told me they actually do have them they just couldn't give us any? Are you out of rice too?! Not a good first impression.."}
{"text":"Please don't judge me as I chose convenience again.  The last time I wrote a review for this place I gave them a 2 star.  This time, I chose to up the rating just a little.  I ordered a few things and two of them were good tonight. 

I ordered the beef with oyster sauce (larger size), sweet and sour pork (larger size) and an order of the potstickers.  My bill came out to $25 which is fine because I know I'll get up to 4 meals from this entire order.  

I've gotta say that the beef with oyster sauce is really growing on me a lot.  The beef is super tender, the water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, bell peppers, onions, etc. is all really good.  I made my own rice tonight because I prefer the stickier type of rice.  I thought the combination was a flavor explosion.  The oyster sauce is definitely a great component that ties the entire dish together!  My second favorite thing tonight were the potstickers.  The outside was the epitome of crunchy.  The potstickers were stuffed with pork and veggies.  Super flavorful and served with a soy dipping sauce.  Personally, I didn't think the sauce was needed.  I think they used a little vinegar, but the potstickers were good on it's own.

The one dish I did not like this time was the sweet and sour pork.  Chunks of pork battered and deep fried, served with chunks of peppers and onions.  The sweet red sauce is served on the side.  The only thing I didn't like was that the batter was so thick that they had to fry the pork longer than usual which made it super hard.  Hope your teeth are strong, because you're going to need it!  LOL!

All in all, China Joe's doesn't stack up to my favorite (Joyful House), but since Spring Mountain is 15+ miles away...China Joe's will have to do! LOL"}
{"text":"EDITED: I feel like anyone that leave this place a negative comment are just a bunch of impatient a-holes. You have to wait awhile for your delivery order from almost everywhere (except chains like Pizza Hut and they have a lot of money to just comp assholes like you fishing for free food free shit). They're all about quality AND QUANTITY here. It's a family owned and ran business. This place is truly a hidden gem. This location on eastern only, not the other China Joe's. Sadly, they get mixed up with the other locations sometime and the other locations are not as good. 

I love the service here, very different Asian restaurant environment. It's family owned and operated and they take the time to get to know their customers. The food is also amazing, I LOVE their Thai food! 

They can even make any dish vegan/gluten free!!! Also big portion. Very good quality AND quantity. 

Any bad reviews are probably from the previous owners. Give this place a try, you will love them!"}
{"text":"I waited 25 minutes for 3 egg rolls and I shitted them out within 5 minutes. Needless to say, my ass was tore up. They need to check their ingredients."}
{"text":"I've been visiting China Joe's for over a decade. The food is always hot and delish.   Price is very affordable, and although the restaurant is small, the staff are generally friendly and quick to take our orders. I LOVE their egg drop soup and sweet and sour chicken.  I'm picking some up now!"}
{"text":"I moved from Kansas to Vegas about a year ago and I was consistently disappointed with the Chinese food here in the area. I finally found China Joe's and couldn't be more thrilled. The service is great, and since we order the same items every week on the same day, the owner just says \"I know you, it'll be ready in 15 minutes\".... love it! I even converted my boyfriend who was going all the way to Chinatown (from Henderson), and he's extremely picky!"}
{"text":"Overall good satisfaction with this particular restaurant. Service was quick and friendly, they have a decent lunch special with large proportions. I enjoyed the orange chicken :) the fried rice was kind of dry, but the side of chow mein that was included with the lunch special made up for it :)"}
{"text":"Really poor food especially the lemon chicken; It was burned and chewy. More of chicken jerky--totally unedible. Egg Foo Young was not traditional. Wonton soup was okay and that's about it. Took forever to make our food. My strong guess is that the chef is not trained in cooking whatsoever."}
{"text":"Average at best. No stars off for a bad experience,was just simply average Chinese food. Coming from California I knew where to go in my home town, now having moved to Vegas I find myself looking for a good Chinese food place. This one came up as close by so I ordered online. Took almost an hour to get my food and they are really just down the street. But really just didn't find the food anywhere close to what I have had. My search continues in the area for a good place."}
{"text":"Great food, great service for the price. Don't walk in thinking you're going to get your $5 curry bowl with dainty flowers and a mint on your pillow; no, you get the best f*cking curry five bucks can buy that you will BODY SLAM the remains into the trash because you are so pumped after your delicious meal.

Sometimes they can get super busy, it's a small outlet right by the college campus, so busy nights can be hard to call in-- but it's fast if you walk in and pick up. My boyfriend and I love this place because it's nearby, the food is always delicious and well cooked! Too often do you have to worry about cheaper priced food not being to standard, but not here and even with my sensitivities. My favorite is the Moo Goo Gai Pan :)"}
{"text":"Best Chinese delivery I've ever had in Henderson. The cream cheese wontons are to die for. We had our food to us in 32 minutes. I think that's outrageously fast. I will definitely order from them again. :)"}
{"text":"Food was very good. I called them for a delivery around 7:15pm and had my food by 7:40pm. It was quick and the food was still hot when I got it. Will definitely be ordering from here again. Chicken fried rice was delicious, the chicken curry had a great flavor but way to spicy. If you don't eat spicy and order the chicken curry I would recommend telling them mild."}
{"text":"I am happy to report that my last order was just a fluke. I just ordered generals chicken with noodles and eggrolls and everything was great! Noodles weren't mushy and, although still lacking, the eggrolls were awesome! The chicken actually seemed better than before.
Will definitely be ordering again :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the green curry, chicken lettuce wraps, walnut shrimp and crab Rangoon. It was all SO SALTY I couldn't even eat it!!! I'm so disappointed. Never again!!"}
{"text":"This is too many stars, do not order delivery, twice now took an hour. Food was ice cold, the first time it was hot and the egg rolls were so good. The next time and Last COLD food egg rolls were nasty, we even ordered and extra order of egg rolls, but you only get TWO. Chicken teriyaki was tough as a cheap steak and ICE COLD, inedible food and no flavor the second time. Although I thought the food was good the first time, even though it took 1 hour to deliver, the second time it was nasty, cold and the good egg rolls from the first time were empty piles of mush this time. SAVE YOUR MONEY, even china a GO GO is better if you can believe that. They have some real problems with delivery and food preparation. You need some focus folks, maybe a better GM or District Manager would help. NASTY, TASTLESS TRASHY COLD food, If you order and you get trash, do not bother to call them, you will not get a hospitable response, or your money returned, or have them come back and pick the nasty food up and replace it
. JUST STAY AWAY I hope I saved you $30-$40 for two people  CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN"}
{"text":"The food was so bad it's the first time in my life I have ever called a delivery place for a refund and to pick up their unedible food. Absolutely disgusting! The food came in a bag full of its own juice (spilled over) the kung pao celery (since the handful of spongy undercooked chicken pieces were hardly visible) our order was incorrect with no cream cheese wontons and some foil wrapped thing I think may have been chicken instead of the bbq robs we paid for. The only thing that may had been edible, had the other dish not completely saturated it with juice, was possibly the fried rice but the shrimp didn't taste cooked. We finally said to each other \"this food isn't edible\" and broke down and called. Dont waste your money, you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chicken Chow Mein NY Style aka cold, bland, soggy, flat, soupy, carcass paste... (after waiting one hour for 'delivery' - meaning stopping the movie, getting dressed, running a block to meet the driver in an alley) ruined our movie dinner night, made my girl sick, and they refused to offer any compensation. Next time I want Chinese - I will hit the 7/11 freezer ... this place is a trough house, bon app√©tit."}
{"text":"I had hopes for a decent Chinese delivery place but ended with huge amounts of disappointment. The main dishes were flavorless and the egg drop was oily. Oh well time to keep looking for good Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"This Chinese place is a hit or miss sometimes it's really great and other times it's not so much. I would definitely recommend the Pad See Ew with fried rice. They have great lunch prices."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill over the years. Last night I ordered food delivered. It took an hour to receive. Not a big deal. The food was hot and the quantity was sufficient. The quality of food was not good. I ordered the fried rice, mongolian beef, and chicken wings. It all tasted the exact same. No flavor. It all seemed like it had been cooked in the same wok with the same seasonings. Not good food."}
{"text":"I love going to this place. The food is amazing and everyone is so friendly. I am obsessed with the cream cheese wantons. They recently remodeled and the place looks fantastic. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food @ a very reasonable price.You can dine-in or take out but I would call China Joe's more of a take-out Chinese restaurant.Very good Chinese fast food.The food is cooked to order.The price is very affordable.

China Joe's gets a very solid 4 star rating."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but sadly it's gone way downhill.

First of all, apparently they are \"under new management.\" We received a new menu from them, and there were some changes. We always order the Family Meal B, and tonight was no exception. However, the price has gone up and the portions were maybe 1/4 of what they used to be.

Really disappointing. But not the worst of it.....the food was horrible. The sweet and sour chicken tasted like old oil and there were only 2 VERY small things of sauce with it. The beef with broccoli tasted odd as well, and the vegetables were barely cooked at all. 

This used to be one of our favorite places for take out, but we will NEVER order from China Joe's again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I'm huge on Chinese food .. I ordered teriyaki chicken to go and it didn't taste like teriyaki just plain chicken and the vegetables where nasty"}
{"text":"My husband was raised on the East Coast and is very particular about the Chinese Food he eats.  It HAS to be just like the stuff he remembers growing up eating.  We have a China A GoGo near our house which was the only place he ever gave the thumbs up to here in Vegas.  Until we discovered China Joe's.  We are business owners at the Blvd Mall and I have been on a quest to find a Chinese spot that delivers to our location and is to his liking.  I love China Joe's.  They are quick to deliver, the food is always fresh and hot, and my husband asks for it regularly now."}
{"text":"I'm new to Las Vegas so I find myself comparing food to my Bay Area roots and they did not disappoint the food is really hella good and it was hot I was thoroughly impressed"}
{"text":"The food here was horrible! I ordered from the express menu. The kung pao chicken that I had was average. I just wish the chicken was seared more that way it could of had more color. The beef and broccoli was good. I would definitely not recommend their fried rice nor their noodles that come with this meal. The only good thing that I had here was there sweet and sour soup. Overall its not worth wasting your time and money at this establishment."}
{"text":"Cashier is very unethical. The cook was very nice & hospitable, he brought the our food & offered if we needed anything else, thats why I am giving a 2 star. But I have to say the food they serve is nothing to have me come back. I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad. Literally, school or hospital food is better then what I got. My salad was just lettuce & fried chicken on top. Literally."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The lo-mein is to die for. But I still have to complain about the lady that works there because she is rude and doesn't care 1 bit about whether or not your food is over an hour late which sucks. I ordered my food at 12:04, it's 1:24 now and I still have not received anything. I've called twice since the 1 hour mark and was told 15 more minutes and then 10 more minutes. I work 2 minutes from this location. No apologies, no remorse. They did not give a single fuck. In fact the woman who answered wanted to argue with me as if I was out of line for being upset that my food is taking over an hour to get here. Lunch rush or not, this is ridiculous. Going on 1 hour and a half to get a lunch special.. So frustrating because their food is actually quite good but the service is lame. The delivery guy is nice though, not his fault at all."}
{"text":"Best Chinese & Thai restaurant I've been to in Vegas! Their staff is extremely friendly and service is great. I ordered the Pad Thai  with some potstickers and usually have a hard time finding a place with good pad Thai, but they make it with a really good seasoning and huge portion sizes for what you pay for. All their pricing is very reasonably priced. 

They have over 50 menu items that you can choose from including soup, salads, chicken wings, party packs for events, kids menu, and lunch specials. Found out the staff is actually from Thailand so they have a variety of authentic Thai food options you can choose from aside from the Chinese food. 

You have the option to dine-in or take-out. Nice, clean seating area. Overall great place and definitely recommend if you're looking for some good food in vegas!"}
{"text":"Not super authentic but is that a surprise to anyone? I got my meal fast and cheap. The lunch special I tried was shrimp in lobster sauce for 6.95. It was a little over salted, but it was yummy for what it was. On a budget, its better than going to panda express."}

{"text":"I give them a solid 3 star review.

All in all it was pretty decent and economical chinese delivery for the entire family. Everyone I had contact with was friendly. This meal fed us all for supper and we all have leftover for lunch the next day for $45. I've had better chinese food, but this is the best (thus far) of what I have at hand within MY local delivery area....

....and that was the whole point. I didn't want to cook, I didn't want to drive anywhere, and I wanted chinese food. Score!

So of of the 6 locations this got the middle of the road average at 2.5 stars. I ordered not knowing this so I'll share my experience of how it was from start to finish.

They actually have a much higher rating on Urbanspoon(US) of 81% which has 4 reviews, 3 of them were recent from 2011. I found them on google maps looking for \"chinese\". I was able to see the menu clearly and decided to give them a try.

For a total of $40.55 I got:
1 large order of orange chicken($7.45)
1 large order of beef pepper steak($7.95)
1 large order of chicken egg foo young($6.95)
1 wor wonton soup($5.95)
1 small order of veggie egg rolls($1.75)
1 chicken fried rice($4.95)
1 order cream cheese wontons (free with order, but would have cost $3.95)

The woman on the phone had a strong accent but I managed to get my order through. I asked if there were any deals and because my order was above a certain amount she threw in a free order of cream cheese wontons, which my son will love. She was very friendly.

I was quoted at 1 hr on the delivery. It arrived right on time. There was nothing missing from the order and it arrived hot without anything leaking.

I paid $45 total, including the tip to the driver.

Large chicken entrees run around $7.45, Sm $4.75
Large Beef entrees run around $7.95, Sm $4.95
Large Seafood varies from $8.45-$10.25, Sm $5.25 
Egg Foo Young from $5.95-$7.95, Sm $3.95-$4.25

They also do Lo Mein, Chow Mein, Curry, Teriyaki, Pad Thai, Chow Fun(noodles), Hong Kong style pan fried crispy noodles, rice noodles, and 6 vegetarian entrees.

======================================

First, the bad:

I found the war wonton soup to be very bland. I added a lot of soy sauce because it tasted like watery broth. I would not buy the soup again. On a good note, it tasted better with the soy sauce. There were also chunks of bbq pork and whole shrimp. Lots of goodies in their soup.

I didn't think the cream cheese wontons to be worth the money if I had paid for it...but since it was free, they were OK. I will ask for more egg rolls instead next time.

I don't usually eat egg foo young so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like, but this was a little too plain for my tastes. It wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was just there and we ate it.

========================================

Now the good stuff:

The rest of the orders we got satisfied our craving for a chinese dinner. We sampled from everything family style. Lots left over for everyone else as they got home from work and lots left over for us for lunch the next day.

The orange chicken tasted just like what one would expect from orange chicken. Lots of sauce. It was crunchy and saucy in each bite. It soaked up enough sauce as to be flavourful yet had some texture. Son ate it up. I ate it up. I think panda express has better orange chicken but panda doesn't deliver does it. Nope!

I liked the Beef pepper steak. Could have been more beef than pepper but I have to tell you the beef was a good texture and taste. The sauce was great on the rice. It's ironic that it costs more than the orange chicken because you really get a LOT more chicken from that...than beef from this dish.

The chicken fried rice went quickly. Just good basic fried rice.

We also got a container of plain steamed rice for each large entree I'd ordered. I'll probably make my own fried rice another night with it because we have so much rice leftover. So...neat because we eventually get another meal out of this in a round about way.

========================================

I will continue ordering from them, but I'll change up my order next time until I hit a short list of \"go-to\" entrees. The first on that list is the orange chicken."}
{"text":"China Joe's on Flamingo at Maryland is my FAVORITE chinese food place in Vegas. I've been getting my takeout from them for years. Beef or shrimp fried rice, mu shu pork, general's chicken, beef and broccoli, crab rangoon, BBQ spare ribs, and egg rolls are ALL good. Of course it's all about personal tastes. Some places fill general's chicken and their fried rice dishes with chunks of peppers or onions or pineapples, China Joe's just gives you meat and rice. :) The crab rangoon doesn't taste like crab, but that's okay, I get it for the cream cheese.
I used to go to China Joe's just because they were close to home. After I moved across town a few years ago I started trying new chinese places. Disappointed time and again. I never knew good chinese takeout was so hard to find. I go to a tiny mom and pop around the corner if I'm really needing a fried rice kick, but otherwise I call China Joe's to get my food ready whenever I'm on that side of town. And their service is always quick and polite. I love \"my guy\" there. Almost every time I call and pick up, it's the same nice guy at the counter. One time several years ago, they delivered my food and gave me one wrong item. I didn't call them about it because it was good food anyway. But about 20 minutes later they showed up back at my door with the right item! I call that excellent customer service. I've been their customer for at least 5 years now and recommend them to anyone in the area, the Flamingo location only. I tried one of the others once because it was closer....., not again. :)"}
