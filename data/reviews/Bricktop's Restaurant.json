{"text":"Brunch was fantastic!  Service was great!  The create your own Bloody Mary is fun.  Will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Brunch Review - great atmosphere and friendly service.   Homemade donuts are phenomenal! Had the egg casserole which was flavored well. Only gripes were the over salted potatoes and the lack of flavor in my friends chicken and waffles.   Would definitely return for brunch."}
{"text":"The dessert chocolate chip cookie was unbelievably good! Solid spot for dinner with friends."}
{"text":"This was our first time visit and we had an excellent time during lunch. We came with a large group after our children's graduation to celebrate their accomplishment over the past three years of middle school. The mom of another classmate, made all of the arrangements and she made the right decision for the whole group of parents and family members. We had the whole patio area that mid day afternoon and the weather was perfect. First, the service was great ! The staff waiting on us did a fantastic job. Just at our table, every food item we ordered was delicious. From the meatloaf to the Scottish salmon and our side dishes too. First impressions do make a difference if you are coming back to a restaurant and Bricktop's made a great impression on us, during our luncheon. We will be back again !"}
{"text":"The past 3 times we have visited Bricktop's, service has been terrible!! Food is way overpriced as well.  $16 for chicken fingers???? Seriously?!?  I always get the beef  carpaccio as an entree, but my advice is to save your money and get 3x the amount of carpaccio at Brio right down the street.  Last trip we made here was during the final round of the Masters and the servers/bartenders were more interested in watching tv than offering me another round of my $10 martini. Don't waste your time or money at this place."}
{"text":"Great lunch and brunch! Delicious coffee, donuts and chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my wife for lunch.  This was my first time dining at Bricktop's (just moved to Charlotte from Chicago).  My overall score for Bricktop's is 3.5.  Wedge Salad: 4.  Very good, I liked the chopped raw onion touch.  They even split it for us, no hassle.  BBQ Chicken Flatbread: 3.  Solid flavors.  They use cream cheese on it, which I didn't mind, but a few pieces had a little too much of it.  Veggie Flatbread: 4.  Good Mediterranean flavors, I preferred this to the BBQ Chicken Flatbread.  Ambience/Space:  3.5.  Casual & very comfortable.  They also have a nice outdoor patio under a canopy that would be great on cooler days/nights.    Service: 3. The employees were pleasant when dealing with us, but I sort of got the feeling they didn't want to be there.  Understandable, considering it was Labor Day.  No one enjoys having to work on holidays.  Side note: A waiter walked by with some sushi rolls that looked very good.  Will probably give them a try next time I visit Bricktop's."}
{"text":"This afternoon I took my daughter to lunch with high expectations!  I had heard great things from friends and colleagues - in the \"hospitality industry\". The appetizer was great but we  had to send the meal back which was corrected - then okay. Our issue - the customer service/waiter was horrific! Did not check on our table as he did with others. But mostly when we advised we were unable to finish our meals - he brought two boxes...we had to ask for bags to carry out and THEN he rushed my daughter asking: \"do you want that?\" Extremely disappointing I suggest management have him enroll in diversity training class. Hopefully he will learn that \"We All\" carry the same money and the color is GREEN! Will not return nor refer...."}
{"text":"If you are rich, older, and live in South Park- you will love it and fit right in. Was that too much? Seriously, the food is decent and it packs a crowd but I am the only one here that thinks this place is overpriced? I was contemplating the chicken tenders with fries but priced at $18 I wondered if the waiter would cut it up and feed it to me as well. Sadly, he didn't so I settled for the burger which was cheaper. Price isn't an issue for me, I will spend the $$ on a good meal, but Bricktop's just doesn't justify it. For dessert I had the warm chocolate chip cookie a la mode. I love a good dessert! It was pretty large, but a little too chocolatey and why is there NEVER enough ice cream attached to a dessert? The ratio was 4:1 cookie to ice cream. :(  The decor was nice with large booths and the place fills up quickly. If you look around to check out the clientele it is a lot of ladies who lunch with too much botox. I had to ask myself, where am I? If you plan a trip to your dermatologist's office soon and still have some cash to blow, stop by Bricktop's."}
{"text":"No bad food on this menu. My only complaint is that this menu is pricey - especially the wine. 2 glasses of red exceeded my rib entree.  The ribs were the best I've every had & I have had plenty in my lifetime. Think Yelp should have 3 $'s describing it."}
{"text":"I found two pubic hairs in two separate dishes, a lobster bisque and the trout.  The staff was rude to me and my guest for an evening that was in a word: gross in both its uncleanliness and its response - they asked if i wanted another entree ...i said no, ....if i  am the manager I am both embarrassed and and apologetic.  The quality of the food and the management team has slipped from my other visits as well.  It feels more like a chain that special place."}
{"text":"The best place in Charlotte. They are consistent with there service and quality of food. Me and my fiancé dine here weekly. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend with a friend. I ordered the prime rib which was the best prime rib I've eaten in Charlotte. I had their hand cut fries and the yummiest fried onions on the side. The server was friendly and was knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer specific questions for us. The was a miscommunication on my friend's order and the server pleasantly took it back immediately and corrected the order. This restaurant can be very pricey and although the good is delicious, it's more of a special occasion kind of place for us."}
{"text":"The blue cheese dressing on the wedge salad is incredible.  The meatloaf is extraordinary with mashed potatoes.  The service is always friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and always make suggestions about the specials.  This is a great place to go and is very family friendly."}
{"text":"We have been to Bricktops several times.  It is nice, but overpriced.  The service each time has not been impressive, although the food is excellent.  The hostess was flat out rude on one visit.  Had we not been starving, we would have walked out.  Last week we sat on the patio for drinks and apps.  We waited and watched while another party was seated and attended to before us.  We had to go in the bar area and ask for a server.  The place was not crowded whatsoever as it was late afternoon.  Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the top restaurants in Charlotte. The food is always great and the staff is on point every time we dine here. (We sit at the bar almost every time).   The Bar staff is friendly and if we go to SouthPark we can count on a great time at Bricktops."}
{"text":"This place is just so good.  The service is the best in Charlotte--better than any of the fancy restaurants."}
{"text":"First time my wife and I had been to Bricktops...really enjoyed it!  We both had the ribs (they had been recommended) and they were very tender and tasteful.  Had the chocolate chip cookie dessert and it was fabulous!!  Also had the key lime pie but wasn't crazy about it.  The crust was a bit too dry with a strong nut flavor."}
{"text":"Brick Tops is my go-to place!! Right around the corner from where I live, my family loves to drive (or even walk) over for a relatively inexpensive, delicious meal. Last night, my sister and I  treated ourselves to the  grilled artichoke to start and then, per usual, I ordered the fish tacos. The blackened fish of the day was Mahi Mahi and paired with fresh guacamole, white cheddar and brown  rice, they were amazing. There is pretty much nothing on the menu that I wouldn't recommend. The people are super friendly and the service is speedy."}
{"text":"Great brunch! Started with the donut appetizer - the vanilla, chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces are great - but the donuts are also delicious without any sauce. I ordered the crab benedict and my husband ordered the chicken and waffle. As soon as noon rolled around the bartender brought out my Bloody Mary. I was disappointed that the only garnish was a lemon wedge, I'm a big fan of traditional (and creative) Bloody Mary toppings. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the mix (not sure if it's homemade.) My husband enjoyed his chicken and waffle, but had to remove a huge melting pond of butter from the middle of the waffle. My crab benedict was fantastic as well, well poached eggs atop an English muffin (homemade?) with a generous pile of lump crabmeat. I especially liked the hollandaise sauce which was particularly lemony, which complemented the crabmeat well. The roasted potatoes that came with the meal were perfectly cooked, soft insides and crispy outside with great seasoning. The food was a little on the pricey side, so we won't be regulars, but it was a terrific meal. Our server was a bit too nonchalant and actually left the wrong table's check with us at first, but everything came out as we ordered it and the food was delicious, so we'll overlook it."}
{"text":"This place has gotten a lot of bad reviews which surprises me a little.  I used to work within walking distance and it was my go to place for lunch when taking out clients... they were always impressed with the menu choices and decor.  I don't care what a restaurant looks like, but you know how clients are...  would rather have a pretty meal than a good one.    Just kidding, clients, love you forever!  Please keep sending me big checks!  By the way, have I told you that you look great today?  wink, wink...  On different occasions I have tried their crab salad, chicken sandwich, fish special, artichoke dip, calamari, and burger.  I found the food to be pretty good, simple and seasoned well.  I'm not a huge  fan of what the kids call \"New American\" food, but I thought this place was good.  Apologies if I am using the term incorrectly...   I have noticed that people give it good reviews for lunch and bad for dinner... may want to skip it at night."}
{"text":"Lunch on Friday was great. I think BrickTops has the best burger in town! Their food is great, always consistent and comes along with a friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Sunday brunch and went in pretty skeptical judging by some of the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the donuts for appetizer and it turned out the donut machine was having problems which was disappointing BUT the manager came by and said they would bring them to our table as dessert and it was on the house. Now that is the way to handle a restaurant issue. I digress, we ordered the french toast (three huge pieces with delicious caramelized bananas), eggs benedict, and shrimp and grits. They were all incredible. My only complaint is that we had to wait a while for the food but it was well worth it. Delicious meal."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. The Palm Beach Salad is a longtime favorite because it's fresh and consistent. Crab, avocado, red onion, tomato, lettuce. The French dip is the most delicious steak sandwich. This time we had the Margherita Pizza which is thin, crunchy and tasty and the bread pudding is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"After we worked around a slight attitude from the hostess, the manager did an excellent job seating us at a great table on the patio.  Rob was our server and he was excellent.  I had the Trout and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  Never had even an average meal here...always top notch.  The burgers, the ribs, the Prime Rib, and that wonderful French Dip sandwich for lunch...oh man.  Hell even the chicken tenders are outta this world.  Shoulda went here today..."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Bricktops and I think we expected more. In the past we sat in the bar area but this time we tried the dining room area. The service was great both in the bar and dining area. Our server Adam was very attentive, friendly and gave recommendations which we appreciated. I ordered the recommended crab cakes and the bf ordered the tuna. The cakes were amazing as I was told they would be and the tuna just ok. The downfall for us is that we expected more food for the price we were paying.. next time we plan on sticking with their chicken tenders as they are always awesome."}
{"text":"Just a great place. Good menu, terrific service. We were there for a late lunch and enjoyed everything about it. Love the bar! We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Hi there , just a writing a  short note had a wonderful time at Bricktop , fantastic service and the the ribs , were to die for ..... Thank you for all involve ... a truly memorable eating experience !!!!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend for my birthday dinner and had a great time.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere.  We had spinach and artichoke dip w/ fresh tortilla chips to start and the real surprise was the fresh and flavorful salsa that came with it...yum!  The margherita flatbread was great for a lighter dinner option with fresh mozzarella and basil.  However, the real standout was the cheeseburger.  It seems they grind the meat for the burger themselves and it proved to be especially juicy and delicious.  The wait staff was friendly, very knowledgeable of the menu and offered great recommendations.  I will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"3 strikes and out. Tried it 3 times. Food has been mediocre to bad. Way overpriced"}
{"text":"Excellent food, no -- excellent cuisine.  Excellent service -- well, except for paying the bill.    They don't accept Discover.  That's okay.  The wait-person came back with the check, after my attempt to pay with Discover, and curtly stated, \"We don't take Discover,\" as he drops the card on the table.  Hmmm.    His dropping the card on the table must have been unintentional, as he and I discussed.  But after careful contemplation of the way he refused the Discover Card, I think it was a passive-aggressive act, although not a totally conscious one (perhaps).  Management, please take note.  After having expended the effort to write that, I'll be back to try another excellent meal."}
{"text":"I was initially excited about the opportunity to eat at such an establishment, considering the look, presentation, and huge crowd. But, after being told that the wait would be no more than one hour, we had to remind the hostess, on several occasions, that we had been waiting well past the original one hour promise. We were finally seated after waiting for more than an hour & a half. We were served by approximately 5 different waiters who never communicated which caused an array of problems for our table! My experience was one that I will probably never go back considering that there are several other options in the free world!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, but has really gone downhill. The last time we went there, we had to send back three things because they were wrong or just plain bad. Too bad because this used to be the closest thing to Houston's in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Visit Bricktop's at Specialty Shops on the Park for the best happy hour in town!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Charlotte. Try the avacado and crab meat salad, it is a winner. Love the restaurant design, quiet, comfortable and wonderful service. The acoustics are great, allows for nice conversation.  all food items on the menu are excellent."}
{"text":"Bricktops does not disappoint!   I have been here twice within the last year, and I ordered the same thing each time:  Chicke fingers!!  Why?  Because they are the best in town!  Breaded to perfection, light and fluffy on the outside and juicy on the inside.   My side of sauteed spinach for both visits was awesome too!    Love  BTS location in the heart of SouthPark with a great patio, and welcoming decor.  Service is always top notch and good looking if I must confess!  Both of my recent visits were with large parties and the service never waivered each time."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Really like the inside of this place. Nice decor and atmosphere. They have a really delicious app with sugar bacon and deviled eggs. Definitely a must. I had the grouper for my entree. Had the mac and cheese as a side. Pretty good, except maybe a bit too much cheese.  Very tasty fish. Would love to try more of the menu and sit outside on what looked like a nice patio."}
{"text":"This is a 4.75 star review.  I have had lunch and dinner at Bricktop's many times and have never been disappointed.  Please be aware however, I do not stray far from a few favorites on the menu.  Their veggie burger is the best I have had in Charlotte.  Their chicken tenders are also the best (no, I am not a 7 year-old child.)  Their salads, soup specials, and vegetable features are also top notch.  The deviled eggs and sugar bacon appetizer are VERY popular and delicious.  Where I dropped the review 0.25 stars is for price.  The restaurant is not the least expensive for lunch; BUT, in Southpark, nothing is inexpensive.  Parking availability is limited in front of the restaurant and additional parking is available throughout the retail area.  Where I am most impressed with Bricktop's is their service.  Granted, I am a regular, but I have always appreciated the teamwork of the professional servers.  It takes a village and Bricktop's has well-trained the Team to help each other."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE restaurant! We go here about once a week! My boyfriend love the bbq ribs and the sirloin. The palm beach salad and crab cakes are my favorites! They also have some of the best sushi!! I go here now to get sushi instead of an Asian restaurant, my favorites are the Hollywood roll and the Dragon roll. Yum!! They have a beautiful patio, that can be heated and closed in or open and cooled which is perfect in any weather! The patio is where i enjoy my favorite drink (a specialty cocktail of their's) the Rosemary Greyhound! So delicious - must try- everything is good here! & The food is always consistent!"}
{"text":"Recently one of our PAK families at at Bricktop's. It is always wonderful to find a restaurant that is helpful with food allergies. \"We have been to bricktops in South Park and they say they only use olive oil as a lot of ppl have allergies. They were wonderful with our 13 month old.\""}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Good mixed drinks and bar is of quality.  Food is on point   I'll come again!"}
{"text":"Brunch at Bricktops is probably my favorite places to meet with friends on a Sunday. The food is delicious!! We usually come in right before 12 so we can be served a mimosa soon after arriving, but have also come in around 10:30 if We have a busy day planned. The deviled eggs are served with crispy bacon drizzled with syrup-incredible. They serve excellent guacamole, but not always on the menu ( might have to ask for it). I could go on, but bottom line is that I've not had anything that I didn't love while there for brunch."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,awesome waitresses, and superior food!! Eating on the patio is best place"}
{"text":"I always forget about this place and don't know why because I've always had good experiences here.  Went here last night with a group and tried almost every appetizer and they were all excellent.   They have a great bar and the \"outdoor\" patio area (which was closed in and heated) is a good place for a group to eat apps.  The waiters were always available and speedy getting drinks and food and were also patient with our large and loud group."}
{"text":"I visited Bricktop's located in the upscale Southpark area of Charlotte for the first time last night with a few coworkers. Based upon this single experience, I think I'm in love.  :)  The restaurant was crowded despite it being a weeknight. I was impressed with the service provided and absolutely loved the food. I experienced the deviled eggs and sugar bacon that previous reviewers raved about. Their analyses were not in vain. Additionally, I had the prime rib and twice baked potato for my dinner entree. The steak was cooked perfectly and the potato required no modification of spice/dressings.   The restaurant is moderately priced, with most entrees in the upper teens and twenty's. However, the drinks are a bit pricey. I ordered a pineapple martini for $10. It was good, but not great... at least not for the price.  Overall, I give this place a rare 5 thumbs up!  :)"}
{"text":"Wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised at how good everything was.  The spinach dip was so good someone at the table was licking the bowl with her fingers.   I had the meat loaf with mac and cheese side; lets say its the best I've had at any restaurant ever! Someone in my group ordered the fish tacos and they were really rood but the kale salad, maybe not so much. We all were happy with our meals.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Overall good food, albeit can be on the salty side if you are not careful (soup and tortilla chips), but they deserve recognition for their service and customer interaction.  After receiving the wrong order for takeout, we were invited back to correct the mistake, our credit card was credited, and they emailed us a $25 gift card to welcome us back.  This is a restaurant that is working hard to make their customers happy and with good food, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was treated here for Mother's Day. It was horrible from seating, to service, to wine list, to entree'.  It was the worst waste of money spent in a long time!    The seats were outdoor plastic seats on the inside. Uncomfortable for sitting for dinner (ESP in white pants).   Our waitress disappeared halfway thru our meal and never returned. We had to ask the manager standing by the kitchen for refills and the bill.  No one checked on us after our meals were delivered.  And after all the \"issues\" and \"poor service\" we received a bill at full price!"}
{"text":"For the longest time, I was under the impression that Bricktops was a pizza joint, albeit one of those \"upscale\" ones where they smother your wood-fired pizza with food stuffs that simply don't belong on a pizza. Salmon? Are you kidding me?   But I was mistaken, and gladly so. I was pleasantly surprised with Bricktops upon my first visit, and I've been there 3 times since. And each time I've eaten at Bricktops, my dining experience has been better than the previous time.   My first time, I popped my cherry there with a cheeseburger. I figure if you can't screw up a cheeseburger, then you're likely to know what you're doing in the kitchen. Bricktops passed this test with flying colors. One of the best cheeseburgers in town, no joke, and complimented pleasantly with a very generous serving of shoestring fries. First visit, color me impressed.  Second time around, my family and I dined there on New Year's Eve. A bit of trepidation surrounded my dining experience at first; I've been to several NYE dine-ins that have been nothing short of awful because of the importance of the holiday and a stunning lack of planning on a restaurant's management's part. But not at Bricktops. Reservations were honored without fail, our meal prepared with the utmost attention to detail and taste, and our waiter was very friendly and attentive, despite the buzz and the clamor in the air. I opted for the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was wonderful. Nothing beats chicken so tender you can fork it. My wife chose a New York Strip, Pittsburgh style, which she thought was very delicious. I sampled a couple of bites. Unbelievably tasty. My daughter loved her salmon and noodles, and for eating her plate clean, she was rewarded with a bowl of vanilla ice cream. Not just frozen, store-bought ice cream, but fresh-churned ice cream, the vanilla tasting of real vanilla bean. I can't say who enjoyed this more, my daughter or me.  Last visit there, I chose the veggie burger. Pardon my french, but HOLY SHIT, that is one spectacular veggie burger! Listen, just run there right now and try it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  A word about the Deviled Eggs & Sugared Bacon: what you've heard about this sinful delicacy is true. You can't just eat them. You find yourself DEVOURING them. Order a plate for you and your sweetie, and a fight for the last strip of bacon and the last sliced egg may break out, and it's gonna get ugly. So order two plates, one for you and one for him/her. Your relationship will be the better for it.  After 3 visits - and possibly a fourth coming this weekend - I can easily make the claim that Bricktops has become my favorite, go-to eatery in the Queen City, replacing my one-beloved 131 Main."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Bricktop.   Love the ribs and corn. They also have a great chicken recipe, although I can't recall the specific dish.  My only complaint is that service can sometimes me inconsistent."}
{"text":"Ribs, barbecue chicken flatbread, crab cakes, cast iron cookie.  Best in town"}
{"text":"First time customer. I had the pan seared tuna and veggies. It was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend. Most definitely going to be a favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"My fish tacos were pretty good but overpriced for the two small tacos and spoonful of rice. My friend got the crab salad - it was tiny. Our waitress was not the best. She forgot the silverware - even after we got our salads. Had to ask twice for salad dressing. The girl that was filling up water glasses was trying to be cute but was just unbelievably rude. Next time I will go to Firebirds. On the plus side - the place is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"I loved the food here as did everyone else I was with.  We ordered a few appetizers-the deviled eggs, pizzas, etc.  Everything was delicious!! The bacon that came on the side with the deviled eggs was to die for! I ordered the ahi tuna salad and I ate every single bite.  It was perfect--light and refreshing.  The tuna was seared to perfection!! Everyone was happy with their food as well--ranging from steaks to lamb to other salads.  The wines we ordered were delicious as well!  The service was excellent :)"}
{"text":"Hard to find good prime rib in Charlotte, but their prime rib is great. Fantastic food and desserts, Bricktops never disappoints."}
{"text":"Bricktop's is tucked away behind SouthPark Mall a block away from where you think it is. -- To wit: not behind Walgreen's. Any time I go west on Morrison from Sharon, I'm heading to the Mall and turn left before I get to 6401. Heaven forbid you should go to Bojangle's instead! (shudder!)   I entered in the mood for a cheeseburger and I successfully resisted the temptation of a very good-looking menu.  But oh! What a burger! I was told by our waiter that since they ground their own beef, I could get it close to the rare the nanny state won't allow us to have.  It came to the table in like two minutes, dripping with hot, juicy deliciousness. So juicy, in fact, that it soaked the bun into a soggy, doughy mess. Halfway through, I discarded the remains of a once-crispy toasted bun and finished off the piece of cow with my fork.  Friends, that cow died a noble death in a worthy cause.  Even the humble French Fries were remarkably tasty. I'm a light eater and usually get two meals from any restaurant. Not this time. I almost whacked our waiter's knuckles when he politely reached to remove my plate. I was sitting, talking, sipping, and enjoying the feeling of being comfortably full, but still nibbling at my fries.  Rita had the deviled eggs and sugar bacon. The eggs were good, but the bacon was de-freakin-licious!  The drinks were strong and plentiful. My wife's favorite pet peeve is a Martini that only fills half the glass. A cheap bar will short you two thirds of a drink that way. Any place that serves you a third of a Martini is probably cheating you other ways, too. This one was full to the brim and frosted.  My rum and Coke was strong enough to rise up and walk across the table by itself. The well liquors are good, too. No need to call.  Our servers, trainer and trainee, were never more than a glance away. As he walked through the dining area, his eyes would track right and left. We were always able to catch his eye.   I hate giving five stars! I really do. But they didn't do anything wrong!  I'll be back to give them a chance to lower their score. That's fair . . . right?"}
{"text":"Went here for a company lunch and all the food was delicious. It was pricey and I thought the appetizer portions were very small for the price. Also was disappointed they don't serve bread before the meal. Other than that, the food was spectacular. I tried lots of appetizers - tempura shrimp, spinach artichoke dip, and candied bacon were amazing. I had fish tacos with mahi mahi and they were to die for. The fish melted in my mouth. Peach Bellini was good, Mac and cheese was amazing, chocolate chip cookie and gingerbread were all perfect. Food was some of the best I've had. This place only lost points for no bread and small portion size for appetizers."}
{"text":"This review is 100% based on 2 separate interactions with bartender, Mike. I hope the owners are aware of what a gem they have in this employee and treat him accordingly. After living in Charlotte for a couple years there are only a couple standouts and I'm grateful to have found Bricktop's and met Mike. Spent an amazing afternoon on Christmas Day most recently (thank you for being like the only place open) and it was a pleasure to feel at home because of Mike. Will definitely be back to see him!"}
{"text":"Went for mid-week lunch and was impressed how many waitstaff on hand. Host was very friendly. Order put in quickly and food served promptly. Drink refills a little slower than preferred, but everything else very good. Will return!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on writing reviews but when you have a meal this superb it's hard not too! Everything I ate was absolutely fantastic, full of flavor and well worth any amount. Granted, I did dine during restaurant week which meant 4 courses for $30. But I would and will gladly come back as often as I can! The meal started with Tomato soup, followed by their sausage flatbread. Both were perfectly portioned and left me excited about what was next. The Ribs were fall off the bone tender, and sides of mac and creamed spinach were the perfect compliments. At this point were both stuffed and fully satisfied when the best looking skillet chocolate chip cookie EVER was sat in front of us. It's hard not to make room and it was worth every painful bite!   Considering it was a very busy time for the restaurant our experience there did not suffer one bit. We arrived on time for our reservation and were immediately taken to our seats. Our server was on her game and they even worked as a team to ensure every guest needs were taken care of. If you had any doubts about this place before, hopefully I can ease your mind by saying go and experience this place for yourself. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was a bad night but everything was terrible including the service. The \"millionaire's\" bacon was burned. The grilled artichoke over cooked. The $16 \"sushi\" roll looks like it came from Harris Teeter. Most disturbing was how terrible the service was. This was once a go-to place but now it is off the list. Don't waste your time or money here"}
{"text":"Amazing place! I must start by saying that the Rosemary Grapefruit Soda there is the  BEST SODA I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!! I recommend it to any and everyone! The atmosphere is nice, not very french ( and I've been to france). There are big bottles of Veuve Clicquot in the front when you walk in, very inticing. The first time I visited, i went for lunch. I take a late lunch ( around 2 pm) and they were still a little busy and a little slow. But my waitor was great and I scored some free fries! They were great, \"skinny', just the way I like them. I ordered the roasted chicken (half chicken) wich was about 16$ and I ate on it for days. It was seasoned well and juicy. The jus was sooooo good. I had spinach as my side which had a smokey flavor to it and parmasean (I think). My lunch guest had the salmon with spincah...Amazing, flavorful, and moist. The second time I visited was for brunch. Saldy, they were out of blood orange mimosas. So I opted for the Rosemary Grapefruit soda. Amazing choice. We started with the donuts that came with three dipping sauces. Chocolate, Raspberry, and Creme Anglaise (my fav!). They were delicious!! I ordered the French Toast with caramelized bananas, whipped cream and a side of bacon. Huge portion!! My guest orded Steak and Eggs, she said it was cooked perfectly. And of course we had frites!!! I will definitely be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"This is my go too, kick ass service at the bar, not a huge menu, but all the items kick ass"}
{"text":"Tuna was cooked perfectly.  Ribs were fall off the bone, but a little dry. Good slaw."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 8. We were seated quickly. The wait staff was superb. Although the place was full, it was quiet enough that we could hear each other. I had the fish tacos.  They were excellent...the best I ever have had!  I am adding this place into my rotation of go to restaurants!"}
{"text":"I went to Bricktops. I don't know if I went on an off night, but for as much as I paid for my meal , I expected better service. During my meal a waitress came out with a salad that she thought we ordered, but wasn't ours. She then proceeded to go to the next table and I overheard the man tell her that he didn't want it now that his entree had already come out. The next incident was my meal came out, but not my boyfriends. The waitress walked by and said she would be right back to go check on it. It took 10 more minutes for his to come out after mine had already been served. My food was not hot. It came out luke warm. Although the food was tasty there are too many negative things that happened tonight for me to want to go back to this restaurant and spend the kind of money We spent. The restaurant wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Seems to be a popular place with business types so is popular around lunch time, but when you sit down the staff will be extremely friendly and skilled. I got the steak and fries and was very good, albeit not quite as hot as I'd like but not cold. If they have the twice baked potato I'd recommend it as it is excellent."}
{"text":"Steak cooked perfectly. Apps and dinner were both delicious. Next time I'm back in NC, I know where I will be eating !"}
{"text":"Went to Bricktop's for our Anniversary. We were looking for a nice meal and a long conversation. When we arrived, we were concerned with the noise because of a significant number of families, but when we were seated, we had a nice table in the back of the restaurant.   The only negative of the restaurant was parking.   Everything else was incredibly positive.   Nice pace from the server. Never rushed. Never wondering where he was.   Had the Beet/Goat Cheese Salad - split it (no additional charge). It was very nice and light.   My wife had the filet and creamed spinach.   I had the NY Strip and Fettuccine Alfredo.   Then, we split a baked potato...  Wow...we were so excited about the food. My wife said it was the best steak she had eaten in some time.   We ended our meal with the bread pudding. I've had bread pudding all over the world. This was among the best. The sauce and the creme anglaise were perfect. What an ending to a great evening.   It's noisy, but just enough so that you don't think people can hear your conversation.   It's casual enough to feel comfortable, but nice enough for our anniversary.   We will return."}
{"text":"Bricktops was an all around disappointment!   Cold mac and cheese and broccoli. They did bring some back piping hot, but this time they were both overcooked. The broccoli could have fallen of the stem.   The initial bite of the mashed potatoes seemed pretty good, but had a strange unbecoming lasting flavor.    My friend ordered the Trout with fries. She said it was ok and the fries were the best part of her meal.   The Cream of corn - for me, was practically the only saving grace to this place.   The manager Jamie Stegall, was very apologetic. Also a saving grace to the whole experience! She was sweet and offered to bring anything else with no cost. She sweetly packed up some cream of corn to go with her card to receive a free dessert the next time I come."}
{"text":"We had a really good group dinner at Bricktop's.  Even for a group of 16, the service was attentive and prompt.  Our reserved table was ready for us and we were seated on time.  Our appetizers, tempura shrimp and deviled eggs, were very good.  The shrimp was perfectly fried and the dipping sauce had a great taste.  The real treat was the entrees.  I had the chicken, creamy mashed potatoes, and sautéed spinach.  All cooked perfectly and very tasty.  The deserts were also very good.  I am very glad we tried Bricktop's.  With it being so close to my job and home, it is a great spot.  I look forward to bringing my wife back.  It was a really good meal."}
{"text":"My good friend took me out for my birthday today. She loves Brick Top and I have never been - check, check. We went in between lunch and dinner, so no wait.  The restaurant is beautiful. The bar itself is nice sized, and the service es muy bueno.  We had a great server!  We skipped appetizers this go around. But two things caught my eye - the deviled eggs and millionaires bacon, and the goat cheese flatbread - maybe on my next visit.  I had the blackened fish tacos and they were yummy! My friend had the Thai steak salad, I didn't taste it, but it smelled heavenly. And she got the kale and spinach side. It too smelled heavenly and the taste did not disappoint. I will try to recreate that dish for dinner. I think it will spice up my spinach. I noticed the grapefruit rosemary soda. I'm not a fan of grapefruit, but this item made me wish I was. My friend got it, and she loved it. So I have to put my thinking cap on. What fruit can I mix with rosemary infused simple syrup and make into a soda.  I would go again and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad say about my experience here. But did I think the whole experience was worth the $130 for 2? Not really. I had the filet mignon, it was PERFECTLY cooked, (md. rare) and a great glass of wine, but I'll look for some place else when we visit Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch met my expectations. The doughnut appetizer is served with a trio of sauces: raspberry, chocolate and creme anglaise. The doughnuts were really nice. My mom makes just as good or better, but these are still worth it.   The Bel Air Benedict comes with a thick sliced tomato, a good amount of fresh avocado and a poached egg on an English muffin and topped with hollandaise. The hollandaise was a bit thick and not lemony enough for my taste, and the egg was cooked a little too much (most of the yellow was hard), but overall the combination of flavors worked.  The home fries served with the Benedict were salty and seasoned and crispy.   The French Toast with caramelized bananas and maple syrup was the perfect sweet counterbalance to the Eggs Benedict. I appreciated that the syrup was real maple and the butter was real butter. (Sad how often that is not the case.) If possible, I recommend sharing 2 dishes to get the best of savory and sweet."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch for our party! The pluses of this restaurant is how they can have great service and good food, and a fair price point. We had a big group with a variety of people--foodies to meat/potato people. Bricktops pleased everyone with their menu options for brunch--breakfast or lunch choices. My favorite is the fish tacos and you can change the side to one of their veggies or do the fries. I have also tried the warm chocolate chip cookies for dessert & they're scrumptious! Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying YUM!! I've been here a few times and each time has been delicious!  My first visit to Bricktops was last year during restaurant week and I was hooked! Unlike most restaurant during restaurant week, you can actually choose from any entree on the menu for the $30 price.  The deviled eggs with sugar bacon appetizer changed my life! The sugar bacon is more like candied bacon...sweet, savory, and amazingly delicious! I could come here and only get the sugar bacon. I normally order the New York strip cooked medium which is prepared perfectly each time. The wait staff is friendly and attentive without being annoying.  They lost a start because they're serving flat soda! My last visit I order a coke and sent it back twice. Finally I requested water and told the waitress the coke was flat. She replied with yeah, we've been having issues with that for a while now. For some reason she charged me $2.50 for a flat soda I didn't drink!! The waitress was apologetic about the soda charge and corrected the bill immediately."}
{"text":"I polled a few people and everyone agreed: Bricktop's sounds like a pizza place.  Having never been to Bricktop's, we decided to give it a try this past Saturday evening.  It was nicely decorated inside with a modern, upscale vibe, but comfortable enough that you could still dress casual (but not too casual).  We didn't have a reservation, but we were seated within 10-15 minutes.    The menu is basically \"American\" food; there didn't appear to be any other theme to it.  We started out with the deviled eggs and sugar bacon appetizer, only because it sounded unique and certainly not something you see every day on a menu.  The eggs were good, but nothing special about them.  The sugar bacon was basically dessert for us.  Wow.   Tasty, but oh-so-sweet.    None of the entrees -- basic steaks, chicken, fish -- really jumped out at me, so I went with the Ahi Tuna Burger.  It was quite a fabulous sandwich, topped with a ginger dressing slaw (lettuce, carrots; no cabbage thankfully).  It was full of flavor, and I enjoyed every bite.  I chose fries as my side item, and they were thin slices of fried potato with a delicious coating.  I enjoyed them, too!  It was a good dinner experience and I'd recommend it for people who like a great meal but don't like anything too crazy food-wise.  I'd call it a nice \"meat and potatoes\"-type restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing place! I went there yesterday without a reservation and the wait were 25min. Food is excellent, nice entrees and great service. If you like fish, you definitely should try the Dove sole meunière. It was so delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! The decor is very nice and romantic. We went for Valentine's day and from the start things were a little sketchy. We had reservations for 2 at 8. We arrived and the hostess seated us, but we passed 9 empty tables before she sat us in the back. As I was seated I realized they had all people of color in this one little section. WTH  The food was good I had grilled lobsters French fries and cole slaw. DO NOT GET THE COLE SLAW. Crab cakes were delicious also."}
{"text":"Christmas Dinner outing with my infamous book club, great wait staff. Robert was our waiter. Great food. Large portions. Parking could be a little hectic on a busy evening. Will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Bricktops and I was very impressed.    The inside was classy and upscale.  We went during lunch on a Saturday, there was no wait and they were moderately busy.  The servers were wearing their Panthers gear l assume for the weekend.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as an app, it was average.  I let the BF pick, honestly I wanted to check out the deviled eggs after all the reviews. Our entrees were the Palm Beach salad and a regular cheeseburger.   Oh my goodness, it was delicious! I had the palm beach salad, the presentation was beautiful I felt bad destroying it. I wish I had a pic to show.  It came with crab, shrimp, avocado, tomato and eggs. Very refreshing.  My BF ordered the cheeseburger, of course I sampled it.  The fries were amazing.  Not sure why they stole the show but they did.  They were better than hot fresh salted McDonald's fries.  I highly recommend those.  And for dessert we ordered the chocolate chip cookie. It was very rich.  A skillet baked cookie with ice cream and caramel sauce.  Also, on a side note I had the coffee with dessert too, it was very memorable. Very strong.  That may have been one of my favorite things.   I enjoyed Bricktops & would return.  Service was great, food was great.  The only concern was the price, it was on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for, right?!?"}
{"text":"Pretty good/consistent fare but a touch expensive for one notch above average food.  $16-$20 salads are a bit much. Steak Frites were good but not great."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. They forgot to serve our salads first. Everything came to the table at once. Seen a roach on the wall crawling towards me. So gross. Server was very nice. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Wandering about trying to find a place to have a drink and this was the winner. Nice big bar and opened up to the outdoor patio. Very nice and inviting. The place was crowded and I order my standard dirty martini. Bartender Sasha was right on, my tini was made to perfection. She gave us a menu and things did seem pricey but on par with most others. I just felt like drinking and had a 2nd when I spotted the Key Lime Pie and had to have a piece. They brought out this huge piece of pie and I was a happy boy. The first bite made me even happier. It was a case of come near me or touch this pie and we will have issues. Delicious. Between my martini and the pie it was perfect evening. Next time I may have to try some food, but I will have my pie first! Great service, nice atmosphere a must stop."}
{"text":"They have sushi and shoestring fries. Enough said. Generous pours, comfortable bar, etc. Did I mention you can have sushi and french fries?!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant for a work dinner function and was very pleasantly surprised of the quality of food and service here. I had the Florida grouper and it was cooked perfectly - just right so it was not dry. The key lime pie was a little different than the traditional style but still quite tasty. Hope to return next time I am here."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of my boss we came here for a lunch with a couple of other coworkers. I had never heard of this place and I've lived in Charlotte my entire life. Anyways after the hostess tried to sit 4 grown adults in a small booth we were seated in the main dining room. That was really the only hiccup of the day.   We arrived around 11:45 before the lunch rush, which if you come after 12:15 expect to wait. I ordered the steak and fries. That was probably the best decision I made all day. The steak was amazing. It had a garlic butter on it, and the steak for lack of a better term was butter. OMG. I picked at my fries, but wanted to save all the room for the steak. M. Steak.   Granted, if I was paying I probably wouldn't have picked the steak. For lunch it is a little pricey, but on the companies' tab I will take it all day."}
{"text":"We went there on a whim because we were too early for Rooster's brunch. Food was excellent, I had the ABLT and my fiancé had creole shrimp, both very fresh and filling. OJ was fresh squeezed and service was super friendly. We will put them on the rotation for Sundays."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I've been here three times and can officially say it's my favorite place to dine in Charlotte. The food is amazing every time. Please try the salmon, steak, trout with lump crab meat, deviled eggs. You cannot go wrong with any of these. The staff was very kind, polite and we had the perfect server. He gave excellent service and was incredibly accommodating. Love this place! Already planning my next visit!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in town until last night.  Went for my birthday dinner very early 5:45.  There were lots of booths open and we were offered the worst one.  (Why do they do that? Give the first diners a great seat please!!)    Ordered a salad and it was swimming in dressing which I would have asked the waitress to replace if she'd come back around.  She didn't, so I ate it. I used to love the TROUT with capers and lemon butter.  The trout now has crab and brown butter.  It was over cooked and dry (no sauce). I wouldn't order it again. We never saw the waitress until she offered dessert.  One guy dropped off water but the service was lacking.  If it wasn't my birthday I would have asked for the manager.   Soooo disappointed! Spouses salmon and spinach were great as always."}
{"text":"Had lunch here, fabulous food. Have to try the deviled eggs, they are a little sweet but so addictive. Everything was wonderful! Great service too!"}
{"text":"We had a nice meal here tonight. For restaurant week, its 4 courses for $30. I had the caesar salad, sausage flatbread, baby back ribs and bread pudding. Mrs. Dining A had the soup, deviled eggs, crab cakes and ice cream. The ribs, flatbread, deviled eggs and crab cakes were all awesome. Sides of mac n cheese, fries and kale/quinoa were all very good too.  4.5 stars for food. 3 stars for service, which was efficient but rushed. For $30, this is a very very solid deal. We even had quite a bit of leftovers to take home. I'm giving this 5 stars overall though, for the price. It would feel a little pricey outside of restaurant week."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for brunch. I go here just for the candied bacon and deviled eggs. Not too fond of some of the other items I've had here. It's hit or miss sometimes with the way it is prepared. A few times I've ended up with soggy food or really poorly made latte."}
{"text":"Perfection!  The food was excellent, booth seating is extremely cool, the bar is gorgeous.  We had the grilled artichoke appetizer and for lunch, the jumbo chunk crab cakes which were heavenly and the \"upscale\" chicken strips which were prepared tempura-style, light and fluffy.    There are definitely things I could pick on, such as the lack of a true chocolate-based dessert, but they are minor flaws.  And they went above and beyond with detail such as having the nicest bathrooms of any venue in Charlotte.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed fresh sea bass and sautéed spinach after a delicious Caesar salad. The salad was a generous side salad with home made dressing - just the right balance to make this common salad very interesting.  The main course was delivered hot from the kitchen with the fresh fish cooked perfectly, especially for the thickness of the choice cut. The sautéed spinach was delicious too with lemon zest and a hint of garlic. My friend enjoyed the Scottish salmon and was equally impressed with his dinner.  Bricktop's offers a consistently great dinning experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte --- seriously. Do yourself a favor and head there right now. We always make it here during the Queen's Feast/Restaurant Week. This time, we took a newbie friend with us, and she said \"how have I never been here before ... this place is amazing!\"  For appetizers: you absolutely have to get the deviled eggs & millionaire's bacon. The eggs are probably some of the best in the South, and the bacon is basically candied/glazed ... all the NOMS.  Entrees: My go-to is without a doubt the baby back ribs. They're so tender they just drop right off the bone. You get a huge rack, probably about 12 bones or so. More than enough. The ribs come with fries & cole slaw. I'm not a huge slaw fan, so I always sub it out. GET THE MAC N' CHEESE. Seriously, it's insanely good. The crab cakes are also amazing --- great size and huge chunks of fresh crab. My wife and I didn't really care for the quinoa-kale salad too much that it came with ... but to each their own. You can't go wrong ordering either of this. My wife and I usually get these and split our dinners to get the best of both worlds. If you're more of a chicken person, the Parmesan crusted chicken is incredible and the service size is insane ... easily two meals worth.   Alright, stop reading and make your reservations now!"}
{"text":"What really bummed me out about Brick tops is that by listening to the server across from us we were expecting really great service, but our server failed us. For me, dining out is an entire experience not just the food. The food was great, I orders ahi tuna, my fiancé ordered a burger. I really wish our server had made a better impression of what Brick tops is really about."}
{"text":"Never heard of the place so me and my wife decided to go there last night and I have to say it was awesome. We both loved the deviled egg w/the sugar bacon. My wife does't usually eat bacon but she loved it. The prices are reasonable with what they give b/c i order ribs and they never asked me if i wanted a half or full, they gave me a full rack. The chocolate chip cookie desert was awesome. I recommend going to this place."}
{"text":"This is misleading. The price range for this restaurant should really be $$$ because everything was rather expensive. I looked this place up for brunch but we didn't get a brunch menu and it wasn't past noon yet. The food was excellent however, it is kind of an upscale restaurant which my husband and I weren't aware of and showed up in jeans and t shirts while everyone was definitely in business clothing. That was awkward but the staff was still nice to us even though we stuck out like a sore thumb."}
{"text":"I have a lot of friends that rave about Bricktop's and I had never been, so recently when I found myself in SouthPark around lunch time, I decided to meet a friend there.  I was worried because there were a lot of people milling around the hostess stand when I arrived.  However, I was able to get a table right away.   I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad which consisted of seared rare Ahi tuna, mixed greens, red onion, fresh mango and a citrus vinaigrette. At $17 for lunch, this is not a cheap salad, but it was good.    Our service was fine on this visit, and while I doubt I would go out of my way to come here frequently, I would certainly eat here again if I happened to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went last week and now remember why we hadnt been back in a long time.  Went for a birthday party for relatives .  My food was cold when they finally brought it out.  I ask to have it heated and it fianlly came back about the time everyone else was about finished.  NUKED and over done.  GUESS WHO WONT BE GOING BACK.  No offer to comp even after I complained the second time and they could see I wasnt going to eat it."}
{"text":"Yummy...a little shopping and then some dinner.  This is my neighbors favorite restaurant and after hearing her rant and rave about it - the boyfriend and I finally decided to stop on in.  it's conveniently located across from Southpark mall and has a lot of seating indoor and outdoor. The menu is American with a nice selection of seafood and beef.  Carpaccio is by far my favorite appetizer that exists and Bricktops did not disappoint the Filet Mignon was top notch.  I opted for a salad for my meal and was very pleased with my selection - lump crab meat, shrimp, avocados this girl could not have been happier.  Oh and I can't remember what night I went but they had $6 martini's - of course at that price how could I resist a dirty martini  with blue cheese stuffed olives oh yeah baby. Next stop I will try their brunch :)"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Amazing service. Everything was perfect, the NY strip Steak, the lobster bisque, and the chocolate chip cookie/ice cream desert were all exquisitely made and prepared. Our server, Jason, was friendly and helpful. I'm very tempted to stop back here at some point to try the key lime pie as well."}
{"text":"Great dinner st Bricktops tonight!  Even more amazing than the food was the scene we witnessed.  There was a gentleman at the bar who had clearly had too much to drink.  The staff at Bricktops swung into action led by Katarina, the bartender and totally supported by the entire staff. They repeatedly, and respectfully, asked him if he was driving...volunteering to call a cab.  He said he was walking, but they followed him out to the parking lot to make sure.  When it appeared he was looking for his car, they convinced him to come back in. They called s cab and put him safely inside.  Patron is safe and Charlotte drivers are safe.  Heard them say their GM is in the hospital. No worries, your restaurant is in excellent hands.  And we will be back."}
{"text":"It's a little fancy pantsy...Pretentious. White table cloths. However, even though I didn't feel like I fit in much, the food was legit. I had grouper with crab the the lobster bisque was pretty good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"hello heaven...who knew you were here on earth in the form of fabulous food & perfect corner booth ambiance?   i ventured to bricktops on thursday for a lunch meeting and while the company was good, my main takeaway (as it has been in the past) was feeling impressed with my overall dining experience.  greeted upon arrival by hostess, ushered immediately to our booth, greeted shortly thereof by a server who shared the daily features, drinks delivered & refilled in a timely fashion and finally the food.  i went with the grilled steak salad fresh vine ripe tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles with a vinaigrette dressing - others went with the flatbread,  french fries and even blackened fish tacos - we left feeling comfortably full and satisfied with our meals.  while the variety is good, i still feel like the prices are just a tad too high - but maybe the covers the rest of the experience? this remains on my list of definite go to spots in southpark."}
{"text":"I ate here for Sunday bunch. We got the Deviled egg appetizer. It was delicious! For my entrée I got a French dip. I was very disappointed by it!  It was extremely fatty and very chewy. I've been there several times and this was the first time I was Disappointed. No French Dip for me next time."}
{"text":"Had brunch here a couple of weeks ago and I was not very impressed with the food on this visit.  The restaurant itself is very nice, cozy and clean and the service was just great.  We ordered the blackened fish tacos, grilled chicken sandwich, and a kid's meal and everything was just 'ok'.  I guess I was looking for more as I've heard lots of good things about this place and it's no doubt popular as they were overflowing with folk trying to get in......perhaps I'm missing something so I will give them another try at some point."}
{"text":"I went in and ordered the cookie dessert.  It is brought out on a hot skillet.  The chocolate chip cookie is on the bottom with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzled all over.  When biting into the cookie it tasted like a homemade cookie.  It was soft and melted in your mouth.  The cookie wasn't over cooked at all.  The ice cream adds a cold mix to the hot cookie.  The caramel is a perfect topping because it doesn't make the dessert to chocolaty.  The desert cost about $6 and it is worth every penny.  The service is great and I would recommened going to Bricktops, there flat bread pizza, hand made veggie burgers and fries are all really good."}
{"text":"went for brunch. donuts delicious, small bites made to order and with three different dippings (chocolate, strawberry, cream), popcorn shrimps nice and crispy but there were not \"whole\" shrimps inside, just small pieces. crab cakes Delicious, fresh, tasty, moist enough and well cooked outside. Fries were also Super good, the cut is the fine one, which is my favorite.  The place is casual, large comfortable tables with sofa, diner style but more elegant."}
{"text":"The deviled eggs with the millionaire's bacon was insane! Best deviled eggs and bacon EVER! We got the chicken and waffles and it was really good. The drinks were REALLY strong and tasty. We will definitely be back. Our waitress was really good as well. This is probably one of the best brunch places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable. We had a party of eight on a weeknight (with a reservation), and the restaurant was bustling. After a starter of deviled eggs and \"millionaire's bacon\", I had a full rack of baby back ribs with French fries and cole slaw. The sauce had a nice peppery kick to it... good stuff, especially with the slaw and a local beer. My wife ordered gluten-free for health reasons, but when her plate came out it was obviously not right since there were breaded onions on it. The manager quickly took it back and (we think) they prepared a whole new meal for her. It took a while, but to their credit, Bricktops did it right. We would gladly return, and I'd probably go for the ribs again!"}
{"text":"I have continued to be impressed with the food and service here.  I would definitely recommend Bricktops.  When I have gone with the kids they were very family friendly which I did not expect!"}
{"text":"What happened! This is not the Bricktop's I have enjoyed in the past. There with another couple 6/26/14, looking for a long-overdue catch-up and pleasant evening.   Our initially friendly waiter turned out to be incompetent...or perhaps it was the combined team? Salads arrived before appetizers. Appetizers arrived a few minutes later, crowding the table. Entrees arrived 1 minute after the appetizers. We obviously sent entrees back, where they must have sat under a warmer until served. Ribs were okay but luke warm and broccolini was hard as a rock. To top it off, the waiter came running after us outside the restaurant accusing us of failing to sign both receipts. We encouraged him to go back and check...where he ultimately found both and gave a weak apology. This while other diners leaving the restaurant glared at us.  It will be LONG time before we return."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, especially my fish tacos entree.  The brown rice was inventive and a tasty accompaniment.  The atmosphere was great for a casual date or decent meal after Southpark, especially if you are trying to avoid the chains (Cheesecake, Maggianos, CPK, etc).  Looking forward to trying more things here."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in town for consistently good quality food. Went there Friday for restaurant week with my wife and another couple and we all love it.  The seared scallop on the country ham grits were fantastic. I have gotten the parmesan chicken on several occasions and it's wonderful as well. The deviled eggs are as good as advertised.  Plus the location is cool and comfortable.  A winner."}
{"text":"I love going to bricktops for brunch on Sundays. The chicken and waffles are so good. They are seasoned well. They also have good potatoes for brunch"}
{"text":"Without question THE best ribs in Charlotte! Absolutely amazing! The French Dip is also incredible as well."}
{"text":"We had our bachelorette dinner here at Bricktops.  There was a group of 14 of us and they were able to accommodate us with only a days notice for reservation as we had to make unexpected change in plans.  The service was great and everyone really loved their meals. Several got fillets and all said they were great! I can recommend the lobster bisque and the meatloaf. So yummy!"}
{"text":"It's upscale yet approachable. The presentation of the food wins you over as soon as it gets to your table, but the taste seals the deal. The flavor deal. I hear you have to try the bread pudding; that's next on my to-eat list. I was too full for dessert this time around!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the greater thing is you can always see Charlotte basketball player and football player, football team's owner dining there too!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bricktops three times and each time gets better than the last.  This restaurant is very popular with a great vibe, great food, and friendly service.    To save you time, start with the deviled eggs appetizer.  I ordered the eggs because I have never seen a restaurant brave enough to add a dish that is best remembered from a church potluck - what's next ... tater Tots casserole?  However, I was rewarded not only with tasty eggs, but with a candied bacon (they call millionaire's bacon) that literally had me fighting my clients for the last piece.  We also ordered the Shangri-la roll which is a combination a spicy roll, a California roll, and a rainbow roll.  I don't care what you combine as long as it is delicious.  The last two times I have ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with a miso soy marinade.  You can't go wrong here and it is buttery as the best sea bass I have had, but my table mates steaks also looked amazing.  We finished off with a chocolate chip cookie which is served warm in a cast iron pan with some ice cream on top.  Definitely check out Bricktops if you can get a table."}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte, I had lunch on Monday March 20, with my wife and two long time friends. Brick Top's is an upscale restaurant in the South Park area of Charlotte. The ambiance was sleek modern and very tasteful. My wife and I shared a Tempura shrimp. It was very tasty and more than adequate for sharing. We also each had grilled salmon salad. The salmon was well prepared but the salad itself was pedestrian, nothing interesting. All in all a pleasant but not special experience."}
{"text":"Their waffles are excellent. I'm not sure what they do- perhaps Crack- but they were the best waffles ever.   The only reason for three stars is the lack of brunch options. This man cannot live on waffles alone- even epically awesome waffles."}
{"text":"This is another long overdue review! Bricktops is one of my hubs and I go to places in Charlotte, as we're never disappointed! We have had date night, large group and group parties and celebrations here. Our friends & family now love Bricktops too! I hate that they no longer participate in restaurant week BUT we are still always in this place lol. Crab cakes are the BEST in town and I've had my share around Charlotte, no one comes close. I've tried many things on the menu and have not had one bad or disappointing item yet. Bricktops staff is GREAT and accommodating, especially when we do surprise group dinners (they'll keep the cake and the secret).   I recently chose to celebrate a new job at a close by restaurant (just to try it). After we were seated and experienced poor & slow service...my husband called Bricktops and they got us in within 15 minutes AND it was later in the evening (with a party of 8). Needless to say my whole crew up and left place 1 and enjoyed a wonderful dinner/experience at Bricktops!"}
{"text":"Now THIS was a very pleasant surprise! I don't know why I expected a yucky chain restaurant. This was more \"upscale\" than I expected. In fact my date thought she was underdressed in her \"designer sweatpants\" but in reality she wasn't. LOL. I had on my staple shorts and T.....but on the \"dressier\" side...if that makes sense?  We started with the Deviled Eggs and Sugar Bacon. GOD was that awesome! There was definitely a sugar component to the egg filling, and it matched perfectly with the sugar bacon which was scrumptuous.  We both got a version of their supposedly FRESH Ahi Tuna, which the waitress said was flown in almost daily. Having lived on the West Coast I'm somewhat spoiled in what I expect out of Ahi Tuna. Well this was the real deal....as far as EAST Coast \"fresh\" Tuna goes. The quality was excellent, and the sear was perfect. Loved those sessame seeds on the oustside. My date's salad was very tasty as well, with the same tuna (albeit smaller in size).  No wine today. Just water. But overall a really excellent dinner experience. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent! My husband and I went for restaurant week and we were not disappointed. All of the food was well prepared and presented nicely. I had the lobster bisque soup, artichoke and spinach dip and crab cakes and fries. My husband had the lobster bisque soup as well, sausage flatbread, and ribs. Neither one of is could pin point our favorite because everything was so great. The service was wonderful as well, everyone was friendly and our waiter was very attentive. The restaurant has a nice decor as well. I really like that fact that we were not  rushed with our food. We had time to enjoy dish without the next one being brought out. I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back!"}
{"text":"Bricktops is a solid go-to for a nice dinner out, but still in a casual setting. The service is always great and the food never disappoints. The wine selection is very good as well. I recommend the prime rib, filet and crab cakes! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"It was grandparent's day which brought on taking the 11 & 8 year oldsters to lunch.  We chose Bricktop's and this is certainly a classy and well run restaurant for lunch and dinner, as well as group events.  Bricktop's has that modern wood and glass restaurant off of a very sizeable bar.  A covered and heated sun porch is just off of the bar.  Booths are comfortable and there are also table seating and nice stools along the bar.  I will risk saying that it has a masculine feel, but not stuffy old school masculine.  Women will appreciate the classiness of the place.  Wait staff are wearing white shirts with ties along with long aprons.  Adds to the class.  Wife and I really did like the lunch menu.  It was full of dinner kind of items, along with sandwiches and salads. There was grouper, crab cakes, Ahi steak, salmon and trout for sea-foods.  Ribs, steak chicken entrees.    Appetizers were pretty neat.  Nice selection of items different from the stuffed jalapenos or mozzarella sticks.  Wife and I had grilled artichokes, three half's, with a dynamite aioli dip.  Heaven.  I had the lobster roll which was delicious and not skimpy on lobster meat.  And wife had a meaty French Dip sandwich which she could not finish.  The grandchildren had some good options from the children's menu, but opted for corn dogs and fries.  But their meal included both beverage and dessert.  Dessert was choice of chocolate or vanilla ice cream and they were very generous scoops.  They even had enough to share with us.  Service was great.  Adam 809 is one to ask for.  Kept us topped up with beverages and regularly checked in with us.  Nice guy, great server.  We four left happy."}
{"text":"Deviled egg app with a side of sugared bacon was delicious!  We crumbled the bacon & sprinkled it on the egg. Yum!  I had their signature chicken dish which was tasty but unevenly seasoned. It was blackened, which I liked, but one bite would be salty & the next very peppery. A side of creamed spinach was good but rather rich. Hubby had fresh fish which was fine (I thought it a little plain) and my daughter had blacked tuna which she loved. We enjoyed sitting outside. I wanted to stroll around in the surrounding shops afterward but was surprised they closed at 7pm."}
{"text":"The Lobster Bisque is possibly one of the best soups I have ever had in my life. It is not always on the menu, so when you see it, get it. It is crazy delicious."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was a lovely service was a bit slow food was perfect but the alcohol is flowing like mud."}
{"text":"Bricktops is a wonderful restaurant. Their food and service is consistently excellent. The have a warm and cozy ambience. This is s great place for family gatherings, first dates and girls nights out. The price points are very reasonable for the product you receive. Their menu provides a generous variety for the beef and potato lovers to the \" I am counting my calories\" diner. I have never had a bad dish at Bricktops  This is my go to place to eat when I want to relax, drink and have s great time with friends and family."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Thursday night. Very good food and service. Great crab cakes- fresh and not full of breading; it  actually consisted of real fresh crabmeat!  The ribs were delicious and falling off the bone. Full of flavor. Will definitely be back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Went this past Sunday for my wife's birthday. Service was slacking. Meatloaf and mashed potatoes seemed canned. Not restaurant not what I was led to expect."}
{"text":"This was a delicious meal. It was also quite healthy with an ahi tuna salad and all for a reasonable price. Would recommend this to anyone for a quick lunch in the South Park area."}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte for 15 years and was shocked that I had never been here.  This is a very nice place for lunch.  I have been twice in a month and found the service to be warm and professional and the food to be excellent.  I'm sure the dinner menu is a bit different so I'm anxious to try it soon, too.  So far, they have some of the best fish and chips I've found."}
{"text":"Exceptional dining and service! We love this place.  You get treated like royalty.  The food is first rate. We come here all the time.  We are always impressed."}
{"text":"My burger was great. French fries were great also. Very nice spot. Outside patio has great views of the shopping store. However my mimosa was nasty! I will get wine next time. We had a party of 25 and service was fast"}
{"text":"Kale and Quinoa salad refreshing. Nice clean bright environment. No waiting for Sunday brunch. Crabcakes were meaty but not too flavorful. The deviled eggs and bacon was a bit too sweet. Savory egg filling would've been a better contrast to the sweetened bacon. Overall, I might dip around the corner to O'Hop for about half the price. ."}
{"text":"A A AWESOME!  i know this is a chain but I'm head over heals for the sugared bacon and deviled eggs...gluttony at it's best.  (Not one of my finer moments.)  Oh Oh..the chocolate chip cookie is baked in an iron skillet and brought to yor table that way.  Really, who does that?"}
{"text":"The best BBQ chicken salad that I have ever had. Patio seating was very nice. Service was great. Loved the variety of items on the menu. Definitely recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Service was great! Nice atmosphere. The blue cheese dressing was to die for! My friend was staring at my salad while I ate. Menu looked to be seasonal. The Chicken Milanese was juicy and crusted with Parmesan. The beurre blanc (sp) was nice and light. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food and Service - Need to know who to ask for if you want great service (you know what that means!  Should I name the great ones?)  Prime Rib (Ordered \"as RARE as Possible!!!  Served as rare as possible...  Every Time!!!) with raw Horseradish - PERFECT!!!  Not not look at my photos if you are _____ ish about Blood and Bones!  Bread - Being very smart Bricktop's gets there bread from Nova's Bakery!  Ribs - Almost every time I get Baby back Pork Ribs - Bricktop's makes them Perfectly!  BBQ Sauce for a simple sauce this one is very good!  Fries - One of My favorite places to get Fries!  BBQ Sauce - Excellent!!!  Dessert - Keylime Pie with a Thick Macadamia and I think Graham Cracker Crust - The BEST Keylime Pie I have ever eaten!!!  One of the Best Desserts in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place is top notch is service and food quality!  No matter what I've eaten such as the classic chicken and waffles on lyft offered amon Sundays or the fall off the bone baby back ribs, the food is always hot, fresh and of high quality.   The service is unmatched. Anytime I've needed a special accommodation or if something was worn for with an order or mixed up, the problem is always corrected quickly and something is always taken off the bill or the.manager stops by to apologize. The really care about your experience here.   If you want to visit this place. Go on a Sunday around 2pm. This way you can enjoy thier awesome chicken and waffles and miss the church crowd that causes the waits."}
{"text":"This is a beautifully decorated spot. The waitstaff is professional and on que. the manager and chefs greeted and checked on patrons. We ordered Chilean sea bass which was prepared perfectly ...Asian flare with julianned fresh veggies. The wine selection is great. This is a place we will visit again!"}
{"text":"Bricktop's is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Their entrees are light and flavorful, and they have great wines. They have a great patio and heat lamps in the winter, so we frequent that area. The lunch crowd is always busy, and so is dinner - so you know it's good. We never have trouble getting a spot, and if so we will just sit at the bar. The staff is usually very attentive and nice. The flavors and pairings are all good for the specials and regular food. I believe sushi is a newer add, can't vouch for it, but literally never had a bad meal here. Tried fish, chicken, steak and crab/tuna salad which is my absolute favorite. I love that I'm always satisfied but not overstuffed after leaving. It's also very classy, but not fine dining expensive, so it's a good balance. Can't recommend you go here anymore than I have, you shouldn't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Rolled in with a party if 17 and Collin, jessica and Jason took such great care of us!! Excellent food, timely delivery! Drinks never went empty!! Highly recommend for a fun night with family or friends!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bricktops, and let's just say I wasn't impressed given that I had high expectations from reading other reviews. From the moment I sat down, I didn't feel welcome. The food was mediocre at best, but it's their service that killed it for me.  Not once were we ever checked upon and asked how our food was nor were we offered a refill of our water.  If you're looking for pretentious waiters and managers who look down at their customers, I suppose this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I have pasted this restaurant see weak times shopping but I have never stopped. I wasn't sure exactly if it was a pizza restaurant or fine dining but my family finally decided to stop and eat here. We were not disappointed. We were able to get reservations for dinner the same day and did not have to wait long even though we showed up early. We started with the deviled eggs and bacon which I am not a egg fan but they were really good and the bacon was great ! I ordered the Bistro chicken with mash potatoes and spinach. The entree was delicious and the chicken was tender. The only complaint was it seemed to be a little salty for me. My parents had the sea bass and the meatloaf. They both enjoyed both entrees. I think this restaurant will be in our regular rotation !"}
{"text":"That Hana Ranch Hawaiian Ribeye. Holy crap. I think that is probably the only thing I will ever get from here if I ever come back. Sure, this place is a little pricey, but that ribeye was well worth it.  Walking in, you get a sense of high class. But, if you're not worried about the atmosphere, then I wouldn't worry about it. I went in wearing jeans, and well I can say we stood out. But who cares?  I ordered the ribeye. It melts in your mouth with a little bit of tanginess, and at the same time sweet. It was quite an experience. The loaded stuff potatoes was a little over the top. I should have ordered the Mac n cheese, but sadly I didn't do that.   Another honorable note is that their croutons are absolutely amazing. They melt in your mouth just like the rib eye. I believe they hand make them as well."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a couple of days ago.  Quickly seated and service was attentive even though they were very busy. Food was of good quality.  Pleasant decor. My wife said it is an older persons place but there was  a variety of clientele. I would like to go back here again.  Good flavor to the food."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch.  Nice interior and service was very good.    Deviled eggs were good but had like a sweetness to them.  Which is weird because the millionaires bacon that comes with the eggs is very sweet and awesome!  The Ahi Tuna salad I had was only okay.  Fish was over cooked and the salad part was soggy.  Didn't have time to deal with sending it back.  I will go back if I'm in the area again but may steer clear of that particular menu item."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant ... Very upscale ... High dollar ... You need to dress well and make sure you are hungry ... Beautiful ambience and the waiters are awesome"}
{"text":"Every aspect of this restaurant is top notch. The hostessss with their black dresses and pearl necklaces to the decor. The waitress recommended the new pork chop which was wonderful. Only caveat is the parking is tight spots. Location has not changed"}
{"text":"Just got here, still very busy. Our booth still very wet from being cleaned, both seats and table. When hostess was informed, instead of just wiping it down she began to justify the condition by stating it was clean. Had to wait for drink orders. Not impressed with Svc thus far. Martini seemed to lack alcohol & it's $10. Had to wait fairly long for food. When it arrived it was hot and very tasty. Kudos for flavor except for sauteed spinach; garlic overload. My burger while very good was overdone. Our server who was very pleasant comped the burger when he discovered it was not as I ordered. He did so without me requesting it. I will go back, but service really needs to consider the customer more."}
{"text":"Impromptu lunch date with the fam!  Let's do it!  We actually went in blind not knowing what kind of food or anything but what a pleasant surprise! White table cloth and kinda fancy but not at all pretentious.  The service is excellent.  I wasn't super hungry so I opted for ahi salad which was perfectly delicious with mango and jicama. Yum!  The kids were impressed with their food (cheeseburger and grilled cheese) but apparently the fries were the best they'd ever had! My husband had the ahi burger which he enjoyed as well. Because l went light on lunch I indulged with dessert!  The bread pudding is DELICIOUS!!!  We will definitely be back for dinner soon.  I only took one star away because it is a bit pricey for what you get but the food is certainly good."}
{"text":"Always consistent, never disappointed. Loved the flat bread pizzas. Crabtini was excellent. Good service, good place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Especially the fries. Hot and fresh. When there was an issue, our waitress, Rasheda took care of it. The breakfast casserole was great. Shrimp and grits good. Steak and eggs great. Chicken and waffles were on point. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding!   From the Artichoke for appetizer To the chocolate chip Sunday for dessert!   Everything was amazing!   Had:  Ribs, Kobe sirloin, mixed salad, kale and spinach sautéed.... All were magnificent   Wine- awesome poor! And amazing!   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wedge salad very good. I had the French dip. I asked for medium rare prime rib. This was not honored. It was still pretty good.   My friend had fish tacos. She didn't comment.   Beautiful surroundings.   Service cut a star off my rating. Our server was clueless to nuances."}
{"text":"Solid dinner.  Something for everyone, we always start with the sushi (one cali and one tuna) and end with the cookie (delish).  The kale/quinoa salad is actually delicious and i highly recommend it as a side,  flavorful & refreshing"}
{"text":"I eat at Bricktop's quite often and LOVE it! Their chicken sandwich is delish not to mention the deviled eggs.  It is a very nice atmosphere, but still reasonably priced. The patio is also very nice to sit at when the weather is good. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I almost hate giving out a big ol' 5 star review based on one visit, but I don't mind giving a low rating on one visit, so turnabout is fair play!  The fella and I took our first trip to BrickTop's on a Wednesday night; the main reason we went was because they were one of the few places NOT doing Restaurant Week.  We made an 8:00 pm reservation and were greeted and seated right away when we got there at 7:50.  The place was a little more fancy than we'd expected; it felt like a 131 Main or Vine to me with the dark wood, gauzy lighting fixtures overhead, and numerous booths.  We had a view of the bar from where we sat, and it looked pretty inviting and a little swanky.  Our waitress was prompt, engaging and friendly.  We started with the deviled egg & sugar bacon appetizer ($10), which was good, but not as great as I expected.  The sugar bacon was super chewy, but the eggs were good - almost sweet as opposed to vinegary like most deviled eggs.  I can't knock off points on the bacon though because... well, it's bacon.    For dinner, I got the Parmesan crusted chicken ($22) with lemon butter sauce and capers and a baked potato for my side, and the fella got the prime meatloaf (which was more like a large cone of delicious meat) and a side of the Cinderella whipped potatoes ($22).  The chicken was the best thing I've eaten in a loooong time with a buttery, delicious sauce, and then I tried the meatloaf.  Then THAT was the best thing I'd eaten.  The fella and I usually like to play \"who got the best dish,\" and I'm pretty sure it was a tie at BrickTop's.  With an appetizer, bottle of wine, and two entrees, our total bill WAS a little pricey ($90ish + tip), but I don't mind paying to get a really good meal and service, and that's what we got."}
{"text":"Deviled Egg appetizer is to die for! Dover Sole fish entree is littered with bones -- beware!!!! Atmosphere is great -- nice, but not stuffy.  Service is hit and miss. We were there on New Year's Eve and our waitress seemed totally sidetracked although it was only 5:30."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night with my coworker. Crowded but got seated right away. Cool vibe, great server, outstanding food, scrumptious dessert!!   I ordered the Bistro Chicken -- pan sautéed, thinly sliced, served with creamy whipped potatoes & fresh sautéed spinach -- heaven on a plate. I ate every last crumb on my plate.   The dessert didn't disappoint - do desserts ever disappoint though? Vanilla ice cream with espresso and truffle almonds - I wanted another one.   My coworker order the filet with mashed potatoes and got a side of roasted corn.  Do yourself a favor and order that side. You won't be disappointed.  She ordered the chocolate chip cookie and she loved it!!  We definitely made the right decision and we definitely will go back when we are in  Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation at Brick Tops for Queen's Feast.  The table was ready for us when we arrived early, our dining partners were held up in traffic and were 15 minutes late.  Restaurant Week is a busy time for many of the nice places in Charlotte, but we were treated to the superior service and fabulous food we have enjoyed in the past, even though it was Restaurant Week and they were very busy.  We were not rushed at all, the food was perfectly cooked and we had a relaxing and enjoyable meal.  PLUS, we could hear each other speak at the table.  We could actually have a conversation!  This is so rare today with all the restaurants doing nothing to quiet the sound.  I would pick Brick Tops any time we want a nice meal out with friends.  Absolutely loved it and so did our friends who had never been there.  I will sing their praises to anyone who will listen!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best cuisine and ambiance in Charlotte.  Wait staff are highly trained and very professional.  The meals were prepared fresh, served hot, and the flavors were delicious.  Not as expensive as other restaurants.  Will definitely go back!!  Cannot wait :)"}
{"text":"Best kids menu for only $6 with healthy choices like salmon and Mahi and grilled chicken with beautiful sides like broccoli and spinach and other veggies in addition to typical kids choices. The trout with crabmeat and Burre Blanc was fantastic and my husband really enjoyed his prime rib! The service was spectacular and David took fantastic care of us!"}
{"text":"Food is always excellent. Price is a little high but you are paying for excellent service, great food and not being bothered. While we were there we sat next to a famous racecar driver, wife and little girl. No one stared or bothered them. Normal to see this in neighborhood. Deviled eggs are impeccable and I always order them. Sautéed spinach, salads, burger, fish tacos... Can't go wrong. All great. Love the artwork.  Dressy casual attire"}
{"text":"I don't know, maybe it was just a lot fancier than we expected, but the food was mediocre and the service was poor.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've ate here a couple of time and always the food was wonderful.  I've had their salmon, chicken and steak and it's always been served to perfection --not to mention always tasting just great.  I've only ate here at lunch but the service has always been extremely efficient, and polite.   The restaurant is very clean and has a great overall atmosphere.  If I had to pick a lunch place to eat this would probably be one of them; the food is just always good."}
{"text":"First of all this place has amazing food. We come here all the time with our entire family. We eat big and spend big including the tips. Beautiful set up ad and decor. Waitstaff can go from awesome and excellent to obviously doesn't want to be here. The hostess are the real issue they run on a power trip. You're a hostess, not the front door to Studio54. They can be very rude and unaccommodating to babies. Please get better hostesses (all of them) and then we can move up the stars."}
{"text":"A complete satisfactory experience from beginning to end. The restaurant is very nice and the servers and staff are very friendly and professional.   The lunch menu offers a great selection and the prices are fair. The food was spectacular! I mean really good! My Red Snapper was perfectly cooked and the whipped potatoes are excellent. Their Chicken Milanese is also delicious. My only complain would be that I wish they'd give you bigger portion of potatoes.   The afternoon got even better when our dessert arrived. A delicious bread pudding covered in a vanilla run sauce. Wow wow wow!   We will definitely return and if they are consistently good this could be our \"go-to\" restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is the worst ever restaurant ever and I had a huge bug I'm my salad. The waiter didn't care at all and neither did the manager! The restrooms haven't been cleaned in months and there are cockroaches everywhere. I wouldn't take my worst enemy to this shit hole. Do yourself a favor and go Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Bricktops Restaurant is a casual eatery located across from the Southpark mall.  I have eaten lunch here on two occasions and both times my meal was pretty good.  My favorite menu items so far are definitely the amazing french fries and the delicious guacamole.  My issues with Bricktops really lie in the details.  First, do I really have to remind you to bring me a straw?   That drives me crazy.  Second, when I order a hamburger medium it should probably come with at least a tiny bit of pink on the inside - not charred all around.  I never send food back, but I was tempted this time!  I actually had to salt my burger - something I have never done before - because there was absolutely no flavor.  I ordered the bleu cheese burger and it came with bleu cheese on the top and caramelized onions on the bottom of the bun.  The onions were overpoweringly sweet and that did not help my poor charred burger taste any better.    However, on the up side... this place is very family friendly, and the entire staff is very nice.  It is the perfect place for a baby shower, a lunch with the girls or a business meeting.  We will definitely go back and hope for a better taste experience next time."}
{"text":"I am someone that is very particular when it comes to sushi, and I have to say, Bricktop has some of the best sushi I have had in Charlotte. So unique and fresh. The atmosphere is very classy yet inviting and the staff here is so friendly and recommends the best options on the menu that cater towards your foodie desires. This place is somewhere I have surprise birthday parties all the time, they are so helpful all the time!"}
{"text":"I visited Bricktops today with my mom to enjoy a nice lunch while she was in town visiting from New York.  I have heard good things and wanted to check it out.  We arrived around 12:30, and did not have a reservation.    This is a very busy place and I'd suggest a reservation and would make one next time- even for lunch!  It was a busy spot.  We were greeted by the hostess who informed us that it would be about a 30 minute wait.  The hostess was a bit snooty- but maybe she was just being focused at her job.  She could definitely smile more!  We were seated in the bar area at a booth after waiting around 20 minutes.  We started with an appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip.  It came with chips that seemed house made.  It also came with salsa which was very flavorful.  It was good dip but nothing out of the norm.  Lunch was a cheddar burger for me, and a Cobb salad for mom.  The burger was enormous!  Even big enough for my husband who always complains about the size of burgers at restaurants.  It was $14.  The Cobb salad has awesome presentation and was $16.  Both are pictured.  We finished up our meal with the cookie skillet... Which is much recommended! It was delicious and came with a huge scoop of ice cream with Carmel sauce- but we had it on the side.  It was $7.  The service was so-so.  We did not get checked on a ton considering all of the food and courses we ordered.  The bartender was our server and she did have a full bar most of the time, but maybe they should have other servers besides the bartenders during this type of volume.  The food was good.... The people we interacted with were ehhhhh.  The food made me want to return but I wouldn't say the service did."}
{"text":"2/7/17 Another 5 stars for this great restaurant      My server was very very good and very attentive  Food and service excellent ! Disappointed that they no longer have daily specials they were a nice add to the regular menu Today daily specials were sushi not a fan of sushi  Happy that they always now have the steak and fries  Will gladly go back  as often as I am in South Park"}
{"text":"This is a place that never disappoints. Great appetizers, tasty drinks, and amazing salads. The deviled eggs are legendary! I get them every time I go. The staff is attentive and the atmosphere is cool, casual, and stylish. I have a great time every visit."}
{"text":"The firecracker sushi rolls were delicious! I also ordered the Palm Beach Salad. Loved it. Service is good. Could improve."}
{"text":"I have been to Bricktops many times and have ordered many different dishes.  My favorite is their Veggie Burger!  Not expected at a place like this, but their Veggie Burger Rocks!  The chicken fingers are light and crispy. Their fries are thin strips of crunchy goodness! The ribs are tender and juicy. I could go on....  The only negative is their pour.  Perhaps because it was Wednesday Martini Special Night, but their pour was very weak.  Also, I asked for Cointreau and received triple sec - huge flavor difference to those who know.  Never the less, I still give Bricktop's a 4 star as their food is always good!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! First there was a 20 minute wait to sit on the heated patio so we opted to sit at the bar. We started with spinach artichoke dip which was bland and boring for 10.00. The bartender was ok she dint ask if it was good or not and after two bites I decided not to waste my calories. Next I ordered the lobster roll figuring what was the special had to be good. My husband had a crab salad with shrimp and avocado. When my lobster roll arrived it was on a hamburger bun???? With sesame seeds? The lobster was ok blah completely not quality of 19.00 no one asked if it was ok.  I ate half and she took my plate. My husband salad had so much avocado and hardly any lettuce. I definitely will not waste 60.00 for lunch here again. What a bad choice!"}
{"text":"WOW!  the SoPa Cougars were right!!  This place is fantastic!  Was here Saturday for brunch.  Had the devilled eggs (comes with weird sugary bacon....not for me) but the eggs also come with spicy chili sauce - to die for!!    I had the crab salad, pretty pricey (I think it was 14-16 bucks) but was worth every penny.  Peach bellinis....need I say more.  My friend got a filet and wedge special, also awesome.  All ingredients are super fresh and presentation was gorgeous.  There is also a beautiful patio I cant wait to visit this summer.  Great decor, cozy but classy touches (the chandeliers in the bar could double as grasshopper galaxies.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Ahi Tuna was amazing!  Best I've ever had. Great place, my wife and I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Two words for this place: Deviled Eggs.  This place is a zoo for lunch (haven't gone for dinner) with the south park business crowd. Nothing I've ever gotten here has been bad... the service is decent. I think the only beef I have with the restaurant is that they have dinner prices at lunch."}
{"text":"Brunch was good but the proportions were small for the amount of money. I left feeling like I spent a fortune and didn't feel it was worth what I spent.   Overall, the food is good and the donuts are to die for.   I think this is a place to experience once, but I don't know if I would go back for the price."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  There is nothing here that is not outstanding.   The food is amazing.  The service and atmosphere are also amazing.  Today, I met my friend Dan and we were seated in a cozy booth next to the bar.  It was a spot that I could have occupied for hours because it was just so comfortable.  In fact, we were there for a few hours!   I had the chicken dish with yummy mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach.   It was better than just five stars!   This was a refreshing lunch because it was full service, the food was served on real plates, and it was not a fast order at the counter experience.   We need MORE of these!   The price you pay may be a little bit more than the fast counter restaurants , but you really do get what you pay for!   Bricktop's has earned its reputation in Charlotte and If you haven't been here, you are missing out.   Three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Our party of two received the best service during lunch today from the front desk to Anthony, our server. I've eaten there several times and love the variety of selections on the menu. I had the veggie burger this time. It is huge and so very good and moist. The deviled eggs ARE the best! Great dining experience, even during the busy lunch! Nearly every table has guests, but there were always tables available for more. We will be back soon for the black bean and chicken chili!"}
{"text":"Great place for consistent lunch and dinner meals.  Comfortable setting with efficient and attentive wait staff"}
{"text":"It is pretty good, but a bit over rated and also slightly overpriced. The deviled eggs are talked up a lot. They are good, but they are deviled eegs. The only thing that makes them special is the Sugar Bacon.  I had lunch there and the tuna sandwich was good, but it was served with a run of the mill hamburger bun. Really ... You couldn't have done better than a lame bun?"}
{"text":"This place was lovely and the food was very good. My shrimp and crabmeat salad was so good that I wish the dish would be a bit bigger.. yummy taste though. The service was very good and tables were nicely separated from each other. Loved the ladies room and the artwork there."}
{"text":"Great brunch! I love the smoked salmon app at brunch and the donut holes. Must try! And the carafe of champagne is delish! But don't get a mimosa unless you want lots of pulp in it. Also they have a really cool make your own bloody mary bar!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and both times were lunch.  I just recently was turned onto the Palm Springs salad by my all knowing girlfriend and OMG, it was perfect...plain and simple.  I know I will end up burning that dish out because that's how I do but I don't care.  Nothing else on the menu can likely compare.  I do however enjoy their flat bread pizza but this salad is the perfect portion and calorie for me.  Great service and good food takes Bricktop's to The Top of my lunch place spots."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to having lunch here!  The hostess and the wait staff were wonderful and very attentive.  A tiny salad and two small strips of tuna steak was $18.00 and not very good.  There are fabulous places in the exact same area that are much better for less money."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best sushi in Charlotte (hands down) it's always fresh! They don't have a huge selection but you can count on quality ingredients, try the Hollywood or California roll. Just Sit at the bar (If there is room), the bartenders are great and it's more fun! The patio is a nice option too. The dining room tends to be filled with an older snotty crowd, so I avoid it unless I'm with a group. If you like french fries order a side. They are skinny and so good! They have great salads appetizers and entrees. You can't go wrong at bricktops!"}
{"text":"I was referred to Bricktops by a friend of mine who swore by their build-your-own Bloody Mary bar.  The brunch date me and Bryan went on here was somewhat of a disappointment in that area, as they stopped doing it the week before.  Also, remember if you go on a Sunday you cannot order am adult beverage until 12:00 pm..... We were at our table for an hour and a half!  Our poor server! I will say, I had the chicken and waffles and they were outrageously good! My first experience with that Southern goodness dish...... I was impressed with Bricktops but haven't made it back after my first visit.  I will say if you go, go early! It gets packed by the family-churchgoers :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The guacamole was amazing and so were the ribs, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. The deviled eggs were good but not my favorite. The candied bacon paired well with the eggs, a nice touch."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in LOVE with BrickTop's. I stumbled here on accident one day looking for  mozzarella sticks, which I found out they don't serve. But, they DO make THE BEST Prickly Pear Margarita I have ever had anywhere in the wold. It is DELICIOUS. The spinach and artichoke dip is fabulous. I always get steak tacos with insanely good fries. And of course you can not leave without eating a cookie-in-a-pan. The menu is limited, but everything on it is sooooo GOOD.   The place also has a nice, comfortable atmosphere and it is always clean. I DO think it is expensive, and my husband and I both do not like to spend money wastefully, but honestly, the food is soooo good it's worth the price.   I can't recommend this place enough. It is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I think I will head there now for a Prickly Pear Marg.... soooooo good...."}
{"text":"Always exciting to try a new place. Service and staff were great, very polite. We had lunch. Had 2 appetizers, popcorn shrimp, chips with guacamole. Both were good, a little pricey but decent. I had the cheeseburger which was big and cooked the way I asked. Wife had the BBQ sandwich which she said was very good. I would eat here again but at the moment I'm not thinking about when can we go back. I wasn't \"wowed\". For the two of us the bill was $80 including tip. Pricey for a lunch of this calibre. Oh, had tea for the drinks"}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant. The atmosphere is very relaxing to me. I ordered the Scottish salmon and butter beans. The fish was very fresh and filling. They offered great portion sizes. My waitress was very accommodating and patient. I enjoyed and will be back again. I am not sure of the wait times here normally, because I had a reservation."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I'm from out of town so this was my first time here.  Tried the deviled eggs and bacon appetizer and followed advice of the waiter to add the Melinda's hot sauce...it was perfect and a lot for one person...better to share with one or two others. Salad was fresh and ample as a starter. Entree was the meatloaf-good flavor but a bit overcooked for my taste (prefer meat cooked medium not well)...good portion but I couldn't finish it.  I ate too many eggs! Ha! Overall a great experience and I'll be back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Bricktops however this visit was problematic. Prices have really gone up since my last visit. One of the appeals for me was I felt dining there was a real value. Now, not as much.  I visited the bar so I could take out. I ordered roasted chicken  which is my favorite menu item. During this visit I asked for an extra helping of vegetables instead of the potatoes. The bartender told me they wouldn't sub a green vegetable for potatoes. She said potatoes were a garnish.... and she had to charge for 2nd vegetable. A garnish? Really? I left with the impression that she just didn't want to deal with my simple request."}
{"text":"Not often I give 5 stars!  Went once for a friend's 10-guest birthday dinner in June 2015 and my gf ordered the BEST crab cakes I've ever had. My grouper with crab meat was phenomenal as well. Great mashed potatoes.   Martinis were superb (not that I go to restaurants for the drinks).  Service was superb as staff did a great job keeping the drinks flowing and serving all food at once for 10 ppl on a Saturday night.   I can't wait to bring my family here for a visit!"}
{"text":"Yum! It's a busy restaurant so it is recommended to make reservations if you can. I didn't have to wait for a table, but a few people who came after me did. Service was good... We had to wait a little too be served and eventually someone else took over from our original server, and he was much better and faster! We had fish with veggies, and steak with fries. Both meals were flavored well, and done well. Very tasty! Parking is nearby and convenient, but may be a bit of a hassle on a busy night. Otherwise there meal was great! Atmosphere is adult, but good for children to dine as well."}
{"text":"We had Japanese earlier in the evening, but I knew that I was going to be hungry again. We were staying across the street and the parking lot was full, so one of these restaurants has to be the draw. We sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome! She even heard me when I told my partner that the drink was too sweet and offered to fix it. I ordered the chicken strips as I didn't want a full dinner. That and I thought everything was a bit pricy. not for the quality of food that is presented to you! The strips were juicy, plump and crispy. But not greasy. And there were 8 huge pieces. the shoestring fries were golden and cooked to perfection. Now the slaw was in a world of it's own. Thinking that this is the best I have ever had. Creamy but not to spicy and crunchy. Yum, yum! Of course when I saw the huge slice of key lime pie my friend had. I had to get my own. (There will be no touching the dogs bowl in this group) The atmosphere was delightful, as well as the service. Great find!"}
{"text":"Not the same Bricktops from yesteryear. Tavern burger was floating in grease and extremely over seasoned. Cob salad was good but something in it caused cotton mouth. Drinks were good! Waiter could be best described as pleasantly reluctant to provide top notch service. Probably will not try again for a while."}
{"text":"This place is great!! My favs are ahi Tuna salad, Cobb  salad, yummy salmon, ribs & beef carpaccio (when available). On Sundays the homemade donuts are a total hit. My fav servers are James & Boggy!!!"}
{"text":"My boss took me here today for lunch. I'm definitely coming back with my husband. The ambience and service were excellent. OMG! The deviled eggs and bacon!!! Delish!! I ordered the Palm Beach salad. It was huge! Lump crab meat, shrimp, avocado...all of my favorites. My boss ordered the skillet cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream- heaven! Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Bricktops is what I would call upscale affordable.  Service and food quality is very good from reviews I read, but for me only one of two hit the mark for my visit.  It was a Saturday night and insteading of waiting for a table my friend and I decided to eat at the bar.  She had a cheeseburger and I had a ahi tuna salad and a few beers.  Food quality was great, but the service, which was good in the beginning, fell way behind after or initial order.    The bartender got our initial order....by the way I was the only one drinking alcohol...a draft beer, so one could see my glass was empty from a distance............unfortunately the bartenders passed by over and over and over never asking if I wanted a refill.  I eventually got another beer, but by that time dinner was just about completely eaten.  Its a beer folks.....only service can screw that up....and bricktops did just that...at these prices I'll look for other locations close by to give my money to in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome, love the brunch. Fresh ingredients made with skill, great waffles, and eggs benefict! Not to mention there dinners set the same standard. My one complaint is there ahi tuna sandwich is a bit to salty."}
{"text":"We went to Bricktop's for lunch and had reservations. We arrived a few minutes late, but we were immediately seated and everyone was very friendly, courteous and quick to accommodate our lunch party.   Service - Definitely 5 stars! The waiters that attended to our table made sure we always had water filled, drinks being served and were very attentive to notice when someone was finishing up with their plate so it was quickly removed from the table. There was no pressure to order appetizers, dessert or anything if we didn't ask about it or want it.  Food - A solid 5! We had the deviled eggs/bacon, the shrimp and the guacamole/chips for our appetizers. All were served very fresh, full of flavor and the portions were perfect for appetizers. For our entrees I had the meatloaf with twice baked potato, another person had the fish tacos with spinach and another had the salmon with creme spinach. All three entrees were definitely a hardy sized portion, our food was delivered in a timely manner and all were cooked properly and full of flavor.  Parking - ZERO! Bricktop's is located across the street from SouthPark mall and in a shopping center beside William's & Sonoma where there was absolutely not enough spaces to accommodate the patrons, no valet service available, small parking spots and a very frustrating experience. Going in for the meal we were frustrated from having to search, wait and then park. Leaving we were frustrated as we tried to rush out of our place so the next person could park, get around cars sitting and waiting for customers in other stores and then simply an overall poor design of the parking lot.  Overall, Bricktop's definitely warrants a solid 4! I will return for the exceptional service, well prepared and great appetizers and entrees, but I will make sure I allow enough time to park over at the mall and then walk over to the restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this as a place to take clients and it exceeded my expectations. The Ahi Tuna burger is fantastic! I've taken a few clients and they've had nothing but glowing reviews. Bricktops is now my go to place!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the menu of this restaurant. The food deserves four stars but the service is 3 stars based on my two experiences there.   My husband and I really enjoy the food. We like the Deviled Eggs and the Millionaire Bacon, the meatloaf, Chicken Milanese and the ribs.   We've had a mixed experience with the service. The first time we sat at a booth in the bar area and had FANTASTIC service. That server really set the bar high for subsequent servers. The second time we dined we ate in the dining room and  the service was adequate but not great. There was a couple sitting across from us and apparently the whole entire staff knew the woman of the couple and congregated at their table during our entire dinner which was  distracting because they were laughing and talking as if they were at a party.  With the restaurant practically full, I wondered how they had so much time to congregate. Did they not have other customers to attend to?  Our waitress was adequate but really busy and when  she came to our area, she spent a lot time chit chatting with the couple instead of checking on us at regular intervals.  She had various helpers bring items but  after our flatware was removed with our appetizer dishes, we had to request new  utensils. We had a hard time flagging our her down when we needed something, she  just always seemed in hurry. We had to request drink refills, they were not offered. We had to request bread, it was not offered. We felt like she was not attentive,  like  we were an afterthought, not really a priority. Also the timing was off on a couple of courses. My husband got his salad long after the appetizer but about two seconds before his entree.    Since the second visit was for my husband's birthday, I was somewhat disappointed that service was not as good as the first time. This experience did color my perception of the restaurant somewhat. I left my normal tip since service was not horrendous, but I was not thrilled with it either. Since we had a good initial experience,  I am willing to  attribute this to just a fluke.  I would come here again because of the menu. But if we experienced lackluster service again, I would be not be inclined to return.  Servers need to understand that good service adds to the quality of the experience. It is not just about the food. If I just wanted good food, I would do take out or cook at home. I want the the opportunity to relax, have good meal and be properly attended.  UPDATE: I did notify the management of this restaurant about the second visit. The manager acknowledged that he had had to speak to the servers about congregating at  the couple's table to chat before. Apparently, they are frequent diners at the restaurant and a lot of the staff know them. He apologized and sent a gift card to be used at a future visit. We had already decided that we wanted to return there at some point in the future- they have a brunch menu that looks good- so this was a nice gesture. But if we get seated near that couple again, I am going to ask for another table. :-)"}
{"text":"We were in town on business, staying nearby. Checked out this place at the beginning of the week and loved it! We had a great waitress and the food came out very fast. Food was delicious. Chicken dishes and steak were done perfectly. We returned later in the week. Service not as great the second day. Food was delicious though! Great lobster bisque and sushi."}
{"text":"First thing you notice walking through the doors is the noise level.  It was very busy on a Saturday night but nonetheless after a long tiresome day, this wasn't my cup of tea.  We even had to ask the waitress to repeat herself several times because we couldn't hear her over the noise.  I am getting older but I don't need a hearing aid yet.  Ordered guacamole appetizer and with first bite a warning signal went off.  There was no taste to the guacamole.  Only a slight taste to the salsa.  The chips were greasy and so we ate very little of a $9 appetizer.  No need to consume considerable fat grams on something with no taste.  My wife ordered chicken.  I ordered salmon.  Just like the appetizer, neither had any taste.  The mushrooms came in a separate bowl swimming in grease and cooked in wine.  The wine taste overpowered the mushrooms unfortunately.  Cost $56 to eat a tasteless meal.  I could have put that money in a jar to save for my hearing aid.  The only positive thing I can say about this restaurant is the service was quite good despite them being very busy.  It is conveniently located across from South Park Mall.  We were so unfulfilled that on the way home we stopped at Cook-Out and got a chargrilled chicken sandwich that had much more flavor than what we ordered here."}
{"text":"Bricktop's may not seem like anything unique when looking at the menu or location but don't be fooled. This restaurant, while it is large, has the wonderful service level of a small restaurant. The entrees they offer are 100% of the time well prepared and the kitchen is always willing to meet special accommodations. Some of my favorites include the crab cake and prime rib"}
{"text":"On the way between Sarasota and Cape Cod.  Found BrickTops on Yelp. Really great place with exceptional service. Wife had the prime rib and i had the ahi tuna burger. Food was excellent.  Somewhat  similar to a Houstons. Will stop again next time near Charlotte.  Owners: Need to build one in Sarasota"}
{"text":"Went the other night with a friend that raved about how good this place was.  The import beer selection was very small.  The beef Carpaccio was just average.  (if you want the best go to Collectors Cafe in Myrtle Beach, you'll be licking the plate). Then I got the Ahi Tuna which was missing something.  I\"m not sure if it was the sauce that was throwing it off or what.  The scoop of white rice didnt even look appetizing"}
{"text":"Been back again since my fairly recent review. Took my husband this time. I have four words for you: Get the deviled eggs.  I also got the veggie burger again. It was just as good. But seriously folks, the deviled eggs with bacon crumbles on top may be the best eggs I've ever had."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially on Sundays. Their Brunch is AMAZING!!!! The chicken and waffles for me is the best item on the menu, it's hard for me to order anything else because if I do, I feel as if I am missing out on something. I was not a fan of their grits or the mimosas, BUT the peach drink (can't think of the name) makes up for it. :) This is a perfect place for a girls brunch (which we did) or date night."}
{"text":"This has become our family go to.  They do a fabulous trout, love the crab cakes and the fries are the best in the city- thin and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  They even grind their own meat for the burgers.   The kids menu offers salmon instead of only offering unhealthy stuff like chicken nuggets and hot dogs. When I come with friends we sit at the bar and enjoy excellent cocktails and with the kids we sit outside and play games with our kids.   They can run around in the courtyard while we have a cocktail.  Its a little disappointing that we are there constantly and no one has ever recognized us, I like it when restaurants recognize and welcome their regulars.  But for the most part its a great cozy favorite for our family!"}
{"text":"Bricktops is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! My boyfriend and I go all the time. The atmosphere is great. The staff is always pleasant and extremely helpful. We always look for Rob when we go. He is friendly and knowledgable. He knows his guests and always offers the best recommendations.   I wish I could tell you what to order specifically, but everything is absolutely amazing!! I will share some of my favorites with you.  Appetizers: the deviled eggs and millionaires bacon!! The bacon is thick cut and carmelized with amazing goodness. The smoked salmon is fantastic! I was shocked that it was served warm but this is my current favorite.   Meal: Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my all time favorite dish. The chicken is lightly pan fried with a fantastic lemon butter sauce and capers!!! Bistro chicken is blackened with the same sauce! This is a new favorite. Baby Back Ribs are fall off the bone. I can't share their secret, but they put some extra TLC into these.   Sides: Macaroni & Cheese! I have to have his every single time! Kale & Quinoa Salad is light and delicious. It's served cold which is very refreshing.   Last but not least, you have to order the skillet cookie!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and have for years! It is my go to place for martinis always along with amazing food! Go see Troy, he is the bartender that can take care of of you!"}
{"text":"This place has potential in being good. The flavors were there in the food, but everything I had was a little too salty for my taste. These were the list of food that I had:  Appetizer:  Spinach & Artichoke Dip Guacamole & Salsa Dip  Course: Jumbo Lump Crab Cake  Ahi Tuna Steak"}
{"text":"This is my work group's favorite company sponsored meal location and on each occasion we've had good experiences with absolutely delicious food!   If you decide to go for lunch they serve several types of stacked salads which are a fun twist on an otherwise simple meal. Regardless of the meal I am there for I enjoy the variety of fish dishes they offer and light vegetable sides. The burre blanc sauce they offer is a great addition to the perfectly cooked fish dishes.   The raspberry martini is a great decision if you are adding a cocktail. It has a perfect balance of sweet to cut the liberal pour of vodka.   Sometimes the service is a bit slow but that's understandable considering how busy they get!"}
{"text":"Friends rave about this establishment; we decided on a lark to go for a late lunch last week and wish we'd diverted to other eateries.   For starters, the wait staff was perhaps the most singularly unwelcoming crowd we have experienced in the city. Considering the upscale ambiance and the number of servers on hand versus the number of customers, waiting five or more minutes for someone to greet us and take a drink order is a little much. Furthermore, both of us also had, more than once, empty drink glasses for more than a few minutes during our meal. See previous comment.  We were situated near the kitchen, so I got the delightful view of our server chatting with another server while holding our drinks a few feet away from us. Our presence seemed at best to be an afterthought.   The food was acceptable but nothing exceptional; I have had far tastier meals for less money and better service at nearby Rooster's. The lobster in my lobster roll was bland, lacking the rich goodness that should make that sandwich so tasty, and the cole slaw was fundamentally sliced cabbage with mayo with a little sugar thrown in for good measure. Even the locally produced ice cream was scarcely discernible as peanut butter pie, its purported flavor.  My husband's french fries were good. That much we can say.  Overall, the restaurant reminded us of country club dining: overpriced mainstream and bland offerings amidst a homogeneous clientele. It was the Wonder Bread of upscale Charlotte dining, and in my many years of Charlotte living I can promise you better choices are literally down the block from Bricktop's."}
{"text":"Went here for our family Saturday brunch. We arrived at 11:30 and luckily we didn't have to wait too long before we got a table. It got so busy after 12pm. Our food was excellent. I recommend cob salad or crab salad. It was so fresh and healthy. I didn't feel guilty despite I was stuffed in the end."}
{"text":"So my parents were in town this weekend and I now realize where my indecisive nature comes from as we debated FOREVER about where to go on fathers day. It had to be close to my grandmothers ....dad wanted a big portion (as I prefer small plates so we did a lot of that for the majority of the weekend) ...and mom is super picky in the food department.  We finally decided on South Park and after circling for quite some time we let my dad make the executive decision. My dad walked into our first stop (Bricktops) and noticed the cranking AC and Prime rib and decided this would be our eating destination.   I had a salad and the pr special and felt both were pretty delicious considering how hungry I was. The twice baked potato had enough salt, butter, and cheese to qualify it as heart-attack inducing but tasty none-the-less! We spoiled ourselves and had dessert, I really enjoyed the chocolate chip cookie sundae thing and the key lime pie garnered rave reviews from the rest of the table.   Service was really great, I must say. Our server was on top of everything and made great recommendations. Considering how busy it was I was impressed.   Clean, beautiful, bright food ...it is not. Stuff your face on fathers day ...it is. I'm not sure id go back on my own but I wouldn't be against having another one of those twiced baked potatoes (following a long gym session!)"}
{"text":"We normally enjoy the food and atmosphere, but this time we left feeling taken for granted. The server was new and well understood. But she dropped the food tray on our table and did got on my 9 year old. Barely a half hearted apology. Cmon"}
{"text":"Top level service!! The devil eyes and bacon is awesome!! Always a great go to spot!  They know how to treat the customer."}
{"text":"Ever had one of those events when you had built it up so far in your mind that the reality couldn't possibly live up to the expectation?  Bricktop's is undoubtedly a victim of just such a happening.  Nonetheless, I think that even if I didn't have all this pent-up excitement of a warm chocolate chip cookie dessert in my mind, I would have still been disappointed.  Now I'm not normally one to hang out in the SouthPark area.  But I do understand that it's different than many other parts of town.  You go into this place and you can tell right away that it's like walking into a different planet.  From the outside you expect something like an Applebee's.  Inside, it's way more upscale.  That's not bad, but Bricktop's?  It just doesn't fit.  The name is way more casual than the interior suggests.  Bricktop's suggests downtown pizza joint, not uptown bistro.  Regardless, you are finally inside, and you're greeted with gorgeous wood and beautiful lighting.  It's really a nice looking place.  The menu, while not very impressive looking, has some nice dishes, with prices to match.  This is not casual dining.  Even for SouthPark.  Service is friendly, but not particularly good.  You are seated quickly, but then left on your own for way too long.  Food is brought out quickly - even more quickly than I would have expected, in fact - but you aren't ever checked on again.  Glasses remain empty.  Then again, maybe I'm just not the typical customer and they want me to leave.  As to food?  Definitely doesn't match the decor.  I don't have a problem dropping the amount of money they ask for their food, but I'd like to have something worthwhile in return.  Their burgers were monumentally disappointing.  Almost no flavor.  The blue cheese burger promised caramelized onions.  I didn't get onions of any kind, caramelized or not.  They would have helped.  The macaroni and cheese, made interesting with penne instead of macaroni, had a bizarre cheese sauce, more appropriate to a kids menu (which they have, but not appropriate here on a $5 side).  And the cookie?  Thin and crispy and generally unappetizing.  Even the ice cream that came with it didn't have much going for it.  There was a chocolaty (caramely?) sauce drizzled on top, but it could have used more.  I would, however, suggest ordering it when your food arrives, so that it gets there about as you are done eating.  Otherwise they will take your order with your plates and you'll be waiting for a while to get the cookie delivered."}
{"text":"Bricktop's topped our list of places to eat on this trip to Charlotte. We came on a suggestion from Yelp, but our  expectations were surpassed by the food and more importantly, the service. Rasheda is everything you want in a server. Period. She took such good care of us, and made us feel valued. Her recommendations were so on point and any requests that we made were fulfilled almost immediately. The prime meatloaf, the steak, and the Chilean sea bass were excellent, and the show stopper may have been the creamed spinach.'The serve staff worked as a team to meet the needs of us dining there. The manager was pleasant and friendly, engaging in conversation with us and actually allowed us to brag on our server without once trying to take any credit. Couldn't recommend Bricktop's enough!"}
{"text":"Very nice spot for both lunch and dinner. Nice atmosphere where one can dress either casual or dressy and feel like they fit in. The staff is great and we've always had good service. Rarely do we have a wait when we go, even on a weekend evening or Sunday brunch. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here tonight. The wait was minimal for a Saturday night and the hostess kept us updated on our seating. Once seated or server came almost immediately. She was very attentive and helpful with menu questions. We had two apps, tempura shrimp and firecracker sushi roll. Wifey got fish tacos and I had the ribs. Both dishes were excellent! We sat outside which is set up very nicely. The menu prices are not cheap but the food is very good. Will definitely go back. Oh......the fries that come with the Ribs OMG!! AAA+."}
{"text":"Bricktops was wonderful I had the crusted parm chicken w/ spinach an the flatbread app with a bowl of lobster bisque.  The lobster bisque was as wonderful as when i was paula deans lady n sons :)  There was not just tiny pieces of lobster there were big pieces.  The flatbread very light, not heavy so to spoil you for your entree.  the crusted chicken w/ tomatotes and capers wonderful.  My freind had the ribs, they fell right off the bone, i tried one they melted in your mouth.  For desert the hot fudge sundae very light just enough to get that sweet for the ending of your meal.  I will be back to bricktops , service was great an staff was so friendly :)"}
{"text":"Seriously, the deviled eggs with bacon crumbles on top may be the best I've ever had. The restaurant is in South Park, which is a really nice area of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ate at Bricktop's for a business dinner today and got to try a plethora of different things; overall I was a fan of the food but not super blown away. -BBQ Chicken flatbread: this was decent; the chicken was juicy and the barbecue sauce added good flavor but the flatbread wasn't that crispy and flopped under the toppings -Tempura shrimp: very crispy on the outside but the shrimp were still juicy. The sauce was similar to bang bang shrimp from Bonefish/ Cheesecake Factory and was very tasty -Spinach dip: came with tortilla chips and salsa; all pretty standard- not bad but just average -Millionaire's bacon: great!! Pretty sweet but the saltiness of the bacon still came through, everyone LOVED this at my table. -Simple greens salad: exactly what you would expect; good portion for a salad but WAY too much dressing for my taste (I asked for it on the side but received it poured all over the top) -Crab Cakes: highlight of my meal! The lump crab was awesome and didn't need a lot of spice/sauce because it was so good on its own. The coleslaw it came with was average and the portion was fairly small but the taste was on point. -Chocolate chip cookie skillet: topped with ice cream and a good end to the meal. It wasn't extraordinary but it was a warm baked chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream...you can't make it taste too bad -Key lime pie: everyone at my table thought this was WAY too tart and I agree. The graham crust was good but if you don't love key lime pie I would avoid for sure.   Our server was okay and the food took quite awhile to come out for each course, so I wouldn't advise eating here if you're in any sort of time crunch. Definitely a better place to relax and enjoy conversation without having to worry about being rushed out which is nice."}
{"text":"It's time for a Bricktop's update - and yes, while the stars are still the same I just had to offer some info about their brunch. Because...it.is.delicious.   Yes, a friend of mine sang a pretty song about Bricktop's brunch and within days hubs and I flew over to this SouthPark staple for some goodness. Their brunchy menu is in similar style to their lunch and dinner menu - new American eclectic. Not only do they offer a make your own bloody mary bar, but they also host a variety of specialty drinks (think blood orange mimosas and bellinis by the carafe - NOM).   I've eaten the same tasty dish both brunch visits - the French Toast. Big toasty brioche slices with sides of caramelized bananas, warm maple syrup, fresh whipped cream and crispy bacon. It's delicious not at all nutritious and heavy on the portion for $11. Also, if you're feeling quite indulgent check out the bite size homemade doughnut starter - 13 sugar doughnuts with three dipping sauces (raspberry, chocolate and vanilla cream).   The brunch bill can get a bit out of hand here, especially when you start drinking your weight in mimosas, but it's worth it. Check it out!"}
{"text":"One of my Charlotte favorites. I eat there all the time and it is always perfect. Their palm beach salad is wonderful and a meal by itself. The ribs are quite simply the best in town."}
{"text":"Tried Bricktop's for the first time for brunch with an out of town friend. It was her suggestion. We were seated outside on the patio. The complimentary bread was tasty as we waited for the main dishes. I ordered the Steak Benedict. They ordered the Shrimp and Grits and the Palm salad. In my opinion the steak Benedict had an odd taste. The roasted potatoes we ok. I had a taste of the shrimp and they were well seasoned. The highlight of the meal was watching the servers try to bring down a rain guard as it began to pour down outside.  The leftovers of my meal will be thrown out as no one at my home even wanted to give them a try. I probably will not be back unless it's by a friend's suggestion."}
{"text":"This is one of my local favorites. I am pretty hard to please and 9 out of 10 times they do a great job. I went there for breakfast and they did not have sugar free syrup. The manager ask if I could wait and he would send someone to Harris Teeter after it. I said yes and he did it. I think they should keep it on hand but he sure impressed me with his desire to serve. Great place."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for brunch this past weekend with the parentals. Very warmly greeted when first entered and given a table immediately (we had reservations but you never know how those will go HAHA). Anyway, our server was very nice. They were pretty busy as it was a Sunday morning and we had a bit of a delay with the food. We tried the guac and salsa appetizer and it was really good. I had a blueberry waffle with fruit but the waffle comes warm and had a lot of butter on it which I tried to remove (I didn't want it too soggy) but it still got the middle of the waffle pretty soggy. It also didn't come with syrup so I had to ask for that separate but that was no big deal. My sister got one of the salads but mentioned that it was soggier than usual (with dressing) and she thought it was only so-so. We tried the doughnuts for dessert and they were covered in sugar so super sweet. Good idea though, who doesn't love dipping food in chocolate?!"}
{"text":"I just want to reiterate how out of this world delicious the Tollhouse Cookie dessert is.  So good that my boyfriend and I must always ask for a knife to cut it down the middle as to avoid any debate on who stole the last bite!  Tears could get involved people..."}
{"text":"I came to BrickTops for my birthday with 4 other friends. We started off with the deviled eggs and millionaire bacon, they were delicious! Also had the lobster bisque and that was really yummy! For the entree, I ordered the crab cakes and substituted the cole slaw for a loaded baked potato. The crab cake had good flavor, but the portion was extremely small for $30 and the baked potato came out cold. One of my friends ordered the prime meatloaf which was divine!!!! The meatloaf was delicious! However it was a very small portion, it was more like a meatball instead of a loaf. She also ordered a side of mashed potatoes that tasted like instant potatoes; which wasn't that great, she also added a side of mac & cheese which was pretty good.  Another friend ordered fish tacos with a side of fries. The tacos were actually pretty good. Had nice flavor to them, similar to a blackened taste.  My third friend ordered the chicken Milanese; the chicken was crispy and tasted like perfection. However the dish was supposed to come with a side of Alfredo but the kitchen \"ran out\", instead of telling us that there wasn't any pasta, they just neglected to tell us and sent the dish out without it. Boo!  The last dish ordered was the bacon cheeseburger with fries . It looked really good but I didn't get a chance to taste it. Overall the food was pretty good but I would not go back because it wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Visited here twice.  Great service both times.  They have some really exceptional entrees. The side dishes were not as stellar but still good. Listen and Listen well..... the BREAD PUDDING is exceptional( the desire to eat it sparked my second visit).  Great alcholic drinks-pricey but strong!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here! It's buzzing every night with families date nights & girls group get togethers!! Menu is 1 page (true example of do less amazingly)   Most popular not to be missed appetizer is eggs & bacon.  Perfect for 2 people to share.  Great twist on a traditional favorite.  They have my favorite salad dressing called green goddess but this didn't come out of a squeeze bottle.   I have had many items on the menu that does change from time to time.  Don't hesitate on the Pork Chop the flavor is superb & it's a great portion.  The half chicken is a little crispy outside but juicy on the inside.  If you like fish then order the grouper it'll make you an instant fan! My favorite go to is baby back ribs.  Fall off the bone with a tangy sweet sauce that is finger licking good! Don't worry hot towel is on it's way! They have shoestring fries that compliment every dish & the loaded baked potato is a generous size & heaping in \"loaded\".  Lol we never have room for dessert. Lol in the warmer days get there early to sit out on the patio.  Make a night out of it! ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I love sitting at the bar. Drinks and service are awesome. The NY Strip and twice baked potato are to DIE for. Ribs are delicious as well. My husband and I will definitely be going back again and again"}
{"text":"Came here after work for a quick bite to eat at the bar with a buddy.  3 things stood out - none of them good.  1.  Don't be different in serving gin & tonic.  Served gin & tonic is a regular water glass, which was taller and narrower than what I'm used to drinking G&T out of--also regular straw dropped right in.  Looked like a sprite with a lime, if you ask me.  2.  Time the food service appropriately.  Enjoying the blue wedge salad for appetizer and didn't really get a chance to finish it because the main course arrived 6 minutes later... they had no awareness or were trying to rush us out of there.  Really disappointing that they tried to actively usher people out of there--more so when we're sitting at the bar.    3.  TUNA AHI BURGER SHOULD NOT BE MADE TUNA SCRAPS.  What a terrible, terrible menu item.  It was not a clean steak of tuna meat, rather, it was a TUNA PATTY.  I can appreciate that it was seared and raw, ONLY IF IT WAS TUNA STEAK.  How are you gonna use the leftover tuna scraps, make it into a patty, and only sear it?  It's very awkward item to eat overall--I'm pretty sure anyone that's had the tuna ahi burger here will not be getting it again.  It's more of a trap, in my opinion, where guests that order it \"fell for the trick\".    I will not be returning here.  If you are planning on going, then: (1) prepare to eat quickly; and (2) don't order the tuna ahi burger.    dmo out."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this place.  I have been for brunch and dinner.  Service was always good and quick.  The food never disappoints.  I look forward to coming back again very soon."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Bricktop's and their food... It wasn't until this past Sunday that I went there for brunch. It was fantastic! The handmade mini donuts were insanely good and the waffle was delicious. Everything seems so fresh here. It's a little pricey but if you're willing to treat yourself definitely check out Bricktop's... Brunch or dinner you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The service at Bricktops is great. A friend had her birthday brunch here. I ordered the chicken and waffles. Friends had their lobster bisque, that stood out with decent amounts of visible lobster pieces. As for the chicken and waffles, I thought that it was okay. My request for strawberries and whipped cream was met without issue. The waiter was also understanding when we wanted to taste each other's meals and provided spoons for sharing desserts."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the Southpark area and certainly upholds the upscale atmosphere that one would expect. Reservations are not required, but highly recommended if you want a table in a timely manner.  The hostess said that they only reserve part of the restaurant, but based on how busy they were on a Wednesday night, I can imagine that wait times could get lengthy on the weekends.  I ordered a wine on the menu and was disappointed to discover that they did not have this wine, nor had they had it for the past 2 months. There wasn't a comparable substitute so I was left with the option of ordering a different (less preferred wine) or going without- gasp.  Of course, I went with the substitute as this was my first baby-free meal in a month.  I ordered the American Kobe Steak and it was amazing; my husband had the Scottish Salmon and he was also very impressed. Everything was well cooked and came out very fast given how busy the restaurant was. Very nice to be at a restaurant that has it together time wise. The chocolate chip cookie, comes out in a cast iron skillet and is to die for.  Seriously a must have and worth every calorie!  This is definitely an upscale restaurant- all of the staff were in all black, with pearls and red lipstick.  Everyone was very professional but slightly cold.  There was not a lot of personality nor did anyone really engage with us, heck, I would have been thrilled with a smile after the initial greeting.  Overall, the food made up for what the staff is lacking in personality.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Brunch spot in Charlotte!  Amazing chicken & waffles, and their quinoa & kale salad is delish!  The chicken was so tender and fried perfectly.  The grits were even great and I don't like grits usually.  AND...the Bloody Mary bar at brunch was exceptional!  Definitely a great place for a date or to bring a good of friends/family.  They have great superb as well!"}
{"text":"Get the Deviled eggs and the bacon that's on it is to die for!  The service was good, place Is cozy. I'll go back there for the deviled eggs. That is all."}
{"text":"Truthfully, I wasn't impressed.  I had the Scottish Salmon which wasn't a salmon steak as I had expected.  Instead it was served as over cooked, pressed down salmon brick.  Seriously, it was as if someone had pre-cooked salmon, flaked it and then pressed/formed it into a rectangular patty.  Tasteless and dry.  The Deviled Eggs and Millionaires Bacon was pretty good."}
{"text":"Nestled in the great area of Southpark in a small strip of stores near the mall lies Bricktops. This was actually my second visit, but its been probably almost a year since my first.  The atmosphere is great, and the staff always seem to be on top of things. The menu is a tad bit pricey but the food always seems to be worth it.  I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which came with rice, and included a side of vegetables, and I got the Cauliflower (which I highly recommend).  Very yummy!!!  Definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner for two or even with a group of friends!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely positively fantastic. I had the crabcakes with the fettuccine, I couldn't be happier. I am a tough critic and this place was excellent.    I look forward to my next visit, spectacular"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's our date night go to, even though I pig out on ribs the make sure to give you a hot towel to clean yourself up. Their lobster bisque is amazingly flavorful. My boyfriend loves there Caesar salad to start and is always switching it up and is never disappointed. And to finish we can't resist that warm delicious cookie"}
{"text":"Ugh. This is why I don't eat at American restaurants much. The dinner menu (including a separate sushi menu for that matter) offered one meaningful vegetarian choice, a goat cheese flatbread. It was decent, but hardly special, and by no means worth the $15 price. I suppose a lot of restaurants like this exist, and I only go to them when I get pulled in by a group that doesn't share my diet. Nonetheless, I could reasonably hope for better options.  Certainly, the low-light ambiance and the crowded strip-mall parking didn't enhance my opinion of the place either."}
{"text":"I had high, rooftop hopes for Bricktops but these hopes were flushed away down a porcelain downspout like the meal I had five hours earlier.  Atmosphere - A modern designed room that has maple tables w/ cloth chairs, booths w/ red brick colored leather (or pleather) seats and copper accents throughout.  Service - Service was excellent.  The restaurant was slow and our original server was switched to a new one w/out explanation.  This was kind of odd but we did not ask why as the new server was cheery, helpful and refilled my tea numerous times.   Food - It was early dinner time so I was not looking for a big heavy meal and based on a suggestion from the server I had...da, da, daaaa,...the prime rib sandwich!!  This sandwich seemed like a great decision at the time but later took me to foreclosure and back.  The condemned medium rare misaligned roof meat was stacked high on a fine crusty, buttered and toasted sandwich roll which I dipped its' shingles into a French Onion soup tasting repossession au jus.  For dessert I had the \"Chocolate Chip\", which was a warm cookie in a skillet w/ vanilla ice-cream.  I determined it was either the meat on the sandwich or the sauce that got me sick as the dessert was shared w/my date and she did not suffer the same torture I went through around 10 PM that night.    Overall - The place left me feeling like a fool because about 4-5 hours later it left me feeling like I had a putty knife in my stomach...and this roof was ready to fall.  Once I evicted what was present I immediately felt relieved.  How do I know this is what got me ill?  Well the last time I ate that day was at 9 AM and it was cereal.  Additionally, I felt immediately better after serving notice on this money pit and then selling it to the porcelain gods.  In the morning I was able to eat without a single lean.    The sad thing is that I initially enjoyed my experience here.  I had excellent service which I tipped very well for and was ready to write a favorable review that was until the sheriff knocked and served notice on my meal."}
{"text":"Oh, so *this* is where the South Park folks go for Sunday brunch after church.  This was next on our Sunday Brunch series, and we will DEFINITELY be returning. Our server, Mattison (cool name, right?) was sweet and super helpful. The lady and I were persuaded to try out the doughnuts as an appetizer, which were AMAZING. Light, fresh-out-of-the-oven cinnamon sugar dusted mini doughnuts accompanied by chocolate, raspberry, and creme anglaise dipping sauces. Highly recommend to everybody.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, and the lady ordered the crab benedict, which Mattison kindly suggested adding avocado and tomato to.  I really don't want to type too much or else I might start drooling over my keyboard, but the chicken was moist and perfectly fried, the waffle was amazingly fluffy and flavorful by itself, and the lady's crab benedict had massive chunks of real crab with an amazing hollandai--- sorry, can't go on.  The service was awesome, the food was amazing, the portions were huge... after our brunch series is done, this will be somewhere we will be returning over and over again. After all, I've yet to try their deviled eggs... and all of the rest of the menu. Till next time, Bricktop's. You've served us well."}
{"text":"I really enjoy it here. The food no matter what time of the day has always great, it is nice to come to a place on a numerous occasions and know the food is going to be consistent. The millionaire bacon and deviled eggs are to die for. They have a wide variety of dinner options and a great drink menu, which have all been good that I have tried. The bistro chicken is my to go to, and the sides are all unique and delicious."}
{"text":"We had dinner reservations at another local eatery just around the corner, and since we had some time, we decided to stop in for a drink.  Bar is classy, drinks wonderful but pricey .  I had the Barrel Aged Manhattan, and my friend had a Raspberry Martini. Our drinks mixed well and a great pour, glasses were full to the brim--I will never complain about too much booze!!! Our server at first was great but then seemed to be bothered--we needed a couple extra napkins due to the pour, and she even joked we needed sippy straws--hard to get that first sip with the glass overflowing--oh well.  Again, the drink was made well, but service could use improving--maybe when too big a pour, give me a side car!"}
{"text":"Had not eaten here in years, BF knows some servers there so we went... it was excellent. We were there on Sunday around 430ish so it was very quiet.. BF has sushi (I dont eat) he said it was amazing... we also did a 1/2 of the deviled eggs and 1/2 candied bacon... both were good, bacon was a little much but it was something different to try. We also split the pizza with the beef, cant remember since its been a bit if it was short rib pizza? It was good, felt like it could have used a little less cheese and some sort of sauce... maybe a drizzle of BBQ on the top and that would have really kicked it up. I would definately go back and bring friends who had never tired... was delish!"}
{"text":"Best mac n cheese in Charlotte and best ahi tuna burger  ever.  The service was good and awesome bloody mary bar for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Lovely. Late dinner while in town for business.  We had dinner at the bar and the serving was attentive and helpful with beer and food suggestions.  Upscale dining. I enjoyed my salmon and cheesy cauliflower. Dan had the ribs and enjoyed. We heard, later, this eatery is known for their ribs. Great grapefruit cocktail with rosemary?  We'd be back if in town again."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is good. But nothing is great, except the millionaire bacon. And in my opinion the food is over priced. I have the 4 star ranking because the food is good."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch spot. I come here often and the food is always fantastic. Enjoying one of my favorite things here today....Prime rib!!"}
{"text":"We randomly decided to check out Bricktop's last Sunday as a last minute plan since we had to hit up the mall for some Christmas shopping.  I have been meaning to try them out for awhile but just seem to forget about it!  Anyway, we were there during brunch hours and the menu was fabulous, not to mention the plates of fluffy french toast and waffles that we saw passing by our table...BUT, we didn't go with a typical brunch.  We both ordered burgers.  I don't feel like I have earned the right to review this restaurant since we ordered burgers only...no apps, no dessert, no drinks, nothing special.  BUT--I HAD to give a shout out to the burgers at this joint.  I had the veggie burger and it was a DELIGHT!  It was by far the BEST veggie burger I have ever had.....and I have had a TON of them.  The waitress told us they make everything fresh in house and it was so obvious.  The veggie burger had such flavor and it was so moist!  It was falling apart a little bit but I didn't really mind because it was so good!  It was served with their french fries which were thin cut and very good as well.    My husband ordered their cheeseburger and he put it on the list of his top 3 burgers ever!  He has several dives he goes to in NY for a good burger so the fact that this burger made his top 3 list is truly amazing and speaks volumes for this restaurant.   I CANNOT wait to go back and try more of their menu items because if they are getting the burgers right then I am hopeful that other things will be amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"My food was great! Meatloaf with cream potatoes was delicious. The meat cooked perfectly. But, the server did not give us bread and butter until we asked. Rather disappointed with the services."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here last night for my birthday (she's 19) we had reservations which was good because they were busy for a Wednesday night.  We were seated and greeted in a timely manner, I had a glass of wine already from the bar and my daughter ordered a sprite. We had appetizers of their bang bang shrimp, spinach artichoke dip, Caesar salad and lobster bisque. All was tasty except the Lobster bisque which has brandy in it.  It was fine for the 1st couple of spoons but after that it gets to be too much. My daughter ordered the NY Strip, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  Her steak was perfectly cooked medium and delicious, the sea bass had a sesame gravy like sauce that I did not care for.  The stir fry vegetables that came with it were great thought and very tasty.  I took only one bite of my sea bass.  I put my plate to the side. When the server asked us if everything was ok (at least 15 minutes after we had our food) my daughter mentioned I did not like my dinner. She asked if I would like something else like dessert (not another entry) I said sure because my daughter likes their key lime pie. The manager also came by to ask about getting me a dessert. The point is the sea bass was $38 yet you offered me a $7 dessert. The server was new and sweet but she didn't come back to refill my daughter's sprite till the end of the meal, didn't know what the Cobe steak was nor what was in the BG salad.  All in all, it was just ok"}
{"text":"My update is LONG overdue.  I have been to Bricktop's so many times since 2012 and I hate that I have not updated my rating.  Needless to say every visit has been extroadinary last night's visit kicked this place to a five star rating in my book. I called ahead and put my name in, for two, and was told 45 to 50 minutes. Upon arrival we checked in and headed for the bar. The bartenders were SO attentive and delivered water while we previewed the drink menu.  Wanting to try something new the bartender gave me her take on a few drinks so I went with the French Martini, vodka, chamboard and pineapple juice...Loved it!  My guest enjoyed a Cabernet. We enjoyed our cocktails and after 35 minutes were seated at a booth table in the bar.  Our waiter arrived and brought water and bread, wish was so warm and fresh, it just started the meal off perfectly.  On this visit I decided to indulge with the Crab Cakes and Mashed Potatoes and was able to also taste the Trout with Lump Crab Meat and Deviled Eggs my date ordered. The deviled eggs, how have I not ordered these before??? The creamy yolk was to die for.  As for the entrees, the trout was cooked too perfection with a creamy butter sause and large lump crab scattered on top. As for the crab cakes, they were too die for. All crab meat with VERY little filler. From the cocktails, service and food Brickop's is not a place to not check out. I look forward to getting back there soon!"}
{"text":"Ok so I first went here when a friend of mine started working here......would've never tried it otherwise. But wow I was surprised how good it was! American food....how boring! But everything I've ever had had been wonderful and my son who is very picky loves It too......and he orders the salmon ....not exactly kid fare and the only place he will eat it! Anyway....awesome martinis with house made infused vodkas. I've had the flat bread,all the salads, and brunch and it is excellent. Service is always spot on and that is hard to come by. A pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the area. It's definitely a little more expensive than surrounding places but it's worth every penny!   I have a lot of allergies (shellfish, peanuts, & nuts) and this is one of the few places I am able to eat the fries. They have their own frier and don't share oil with the shellfish. This alone is a huge plus to me. Plus the fries are amazing and perfectly crunchy.    All the food at this place is amazing. I came once when I met up with my old coworkers and another with friends who were visiting. All my friends Saint the place was \"on point\" and a \"great decision\". This will definitely be one of my go to places in the future.    The staff was also great and super attentive. I can always tell how good staff is when the manager comes and speaks to me personally about my allergies and to make sure I can eat what I want to order.   Highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Fancy restaurant that fits right in to the very spendy Southpark neighborhood. Starting with two hostesses to greet, a large and well decorated dining area, white table linen and three staffers to take care of our table (one who did nothing but refill water glasses). If you're looking to impress, this will get 'er done.  We started with the goat cheese bruschetta which was more like a small goat cheese and veggie pizza as you'll see from the picture. Which isn't to say that it's not really really tasty and quite filling. You could easily have this as your main course.  But we didn't. Today was a \"salad\" day. I went with the Cobb, my wife had their \"Florida\". Both were good portions of protein and were very flavorful. Interesting plating for the two salads. They must put them into a cylinder of some sort where they build the layers and then \"flip\" it onto the plate. It looks pretty.  My only complaint is that while there was blue cheese in the salad, the dressing on the side was a balsamic and oil rather than a blue cheese dressing itself.  $14 for the pizza... I mean bruschetta and $18 or so for each of the two salads. A little expensive for a late lunch but it was quite good and I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped into Bricktop's for lunch one day so that I could use a gift card I had won.  Had never been, but a gift card is as good a reason as any.  We arrived at around 12:30pm on a weekday and here's your first pro-tip:  Dress smart.  We were all wearing jeans and we stuck out like a sore thumb.  Definitely more a business casual-type place.  We had to wait approx. ten minutes to be seated, but when we were, we were greeted warmly by our waitress.  She took our drink orders and gave us a run-down of the specials.  My co-worker and I decided on the fish tacos, while another co-worker went with the beef/mashed potato/carmelized onion flatbread.  It took about 15 minutes or so for our food to arrive, and while waiting, I checked out the jukebox.  It. Is. Awesome.  I queued up some MJ, Coldplay, Oasis, Verve, Bruce, Frank Sinatra, and Billy Joel.  Our food arrived and we dug in.  Two tacos came two to an order and the fish of the day (and everyday) was mahi-mahi.  The tacos were really tasty.  The spicy salsa was right on and there was some decent brown rice on the side.  My flatbread co-worker enjoyed her pizza, but found it to be a tad salty.  For dessert, we decided on the cookie.  Delicious.  And now I know why they keep it in the skillet (if they took it out, it would just ooze everywhere).  Bricktop's is a little outside of my normal price-range.  While the tacos were good, I don't know that they were $14.00 good.  On the other hand, I think that dessert is worth the $7.00.  I'll come back, but it will be a special occasion.  And rest assured, I will be kickin' out the jams on the jukebox!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this was the worst steak I've ever had. I ordered the American Kobe sirloin and fries. The meat, and I use that term lightly, was definitely not sirloin. It had that cheap mystery lunch meat flavor that you would find in a bad taco and was more fat that beef. Since there was only about six ounces, mostly fat, I only got about two bites and that was more than enough to feel sick. At $28 a plate that's $25 too much.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice. It just isn't enough to make up for the bad food and outrageous prices!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and had a great experience. Service was friendly, and prompt without rushing us.  I had the grilled salmon salad - cooked perfectly, flavorful, nice portion."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious but the service was why I wanted to write a review. I couldn't help but notice how nice the servers were to each other. I saw them helping each other like a team and it was very noticeable. Melissa was great at the bar! She was friendly & efficient and treated my son and I with great consideration. We were only in Charlotte one night for a soccer tournament and we wanted to go somewhere fun. It was a little pricey but I knew that before we went. Thanks Bricktop's for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I still keep my rating at 3 stars after my last two visits. The food and service were very good. I had the Filet this week and it was excellent. They are getting a price premium because of the neighborhood the restaurant is located in. The price value is good, not great."}
{"text":"Go for the brunch. The sugar bacon and Chicken & waffles are unbelievable."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews I guess I expected a little more but it didn't happen. The atmosphere is nice, relaxing, very country club-ish and so were the people on the day we were there. Everyone else was over 50 and it seemed like that kind of crowd. There was no background music playing, which was very noticeable.   The wait staff were very good, friendly, cheerful and quick. The menu looked delicious but the prices really didn't. My wife had the ahi tuna burger which was just the, ground up ahi tuna with fillers for $16. I had the French Dip sandwich which was good (but also $16) and the au jus had the distinct taste of butter. So much so that I thought the pasted baguette was buttered but it wasn't.  I don't think we'll be back. But hopefully other people will enjoy it. It just wasn't for us."}
{"text":"I've been to Bricktops quite a few times mostly for lunch, but recently when I tried the restraurant for dinner, it gave me a whole new appreciation for their food. Service was amazingly attentive, but not overly so, as they sat my friend and I for dinner. I chose a sushi appetizer (which I never knew they offered) AND IT WAS AWESOME. Their sushi menu is limited, but very good. For my entrée I picked the Prime Rib with loaded potato and the Prime Rib was huge and a perfectly cooked medium rare (just the way I like it) and the potato was loaded to the sky and tasted amazing. A great meal and very affordable based on the portions provided."}
{"text":"Just outstanding. Great atmosphere. Like a real NY steakhouse with the circular red booths. Great drinks. Friendly staff. Love it. Plan to spend money."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. The first time I went it was a cold, rainy afternoon so there weren't many patrons. This time the after work crowd was out in full force. There was no wait thankfully. The server was warm and attentive, she easily answered any questions about what was on the menu.  I had a sushi roll (I think it was Dynamite) which was very good. Topped it off with their delicious baked macaroni and cheese. I always enjoy Bricktops."}
