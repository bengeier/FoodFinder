{"text":"I agree with the other not-so-positive review here! The food used to be much better. Now, there is new management and they are beyond CHEAP!!! I saw the lady behind the counter pick up pickles with her glove-less hands and put them in a container! Can you say \"hepatitis\" anyone? Also, the same lady yelled at a boy for daring to take a napkin. He told her he was a daily customer and she just glared at him! Are the napkins coming out of her paycheque? Really disgusting and gross place! Will never go back. AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went today to get the Noodles and beef special. The noodles were stale, like they sat there for days, the meat was tough. The person that served me used her bare hands to put some peppers on the meat, I told her no peppers please!!!
I think the management changed and the food got much worse. Also I took a fork and the cashier said that I already gave you one. No tact, bad and not clean!"}
{"text":"Soly's has quite a variety on their menu from eastern and western cuisines. You can get anything from curried chicken on rice to a cheeseburger and fries to a burrito.

The curried chicken is quite good and definitely a favourite of mine at this place however, this week I was craving their cheeseburger and fries. It's a little on the pricey side... without a drink it came to $7.33 after tax.

Their burgers aren't really anything special but for some reason, I do like them. I doubt they're homemade and perhaps it's the selection of condiments that makes their burger what it is.

Their fries are reminiscent of McDonald's fries but with way less salt. which actually makes them better. Their gravy is tasty and has a near-perfect consistency.

If there's one thing I've noticed since I started Yelping, it's that I'm not a big fan of salt. Sure, I get how salt can really embellish the flavour of a dish but I find that most places use it more as a crutch.

Not Soly's. For a simple restaurant in a food court, they sure know how to season their dishes appropriately."}
