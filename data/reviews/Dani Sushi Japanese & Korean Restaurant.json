{"text":"Amazing sushi and lovely people who run the restaurant! Always a great experience, we are so lucky to have this place in Long Branch"}
{"text":"In terms of pricing, this place is a little on the expensive side. There are a lot cheaper places where you can get sushi in Toronto, but if you're a student going to Humber College, this is a close place to get a quick fix.  I like how their menu is pretty diverse, with both Japanese and Korean dishes and they even have ramen. It's also nice how they give you both Korean side dishes AND the miso soup and salad. I love Korean side dishes so I was pretty happy with this. The glass noodles were delicious.  The service here was great. The waitress and chef were very hospitable and polite, and they were both very friendly and always wore a smile on their faces. The interior looks more like a home than a restaurant, but it was cozy nonetheless. Plus, they have a TV and play Kpop which is a huge plus for me!"}
{"text":"Prob a 3.5    But fresh fish and lack of competition locally push it up to a 4. Also - I'm mildly snobby when it comes to sushi.  Good service. Friendly. Esl.  Very good fish. Sashimi great quality. Peripheral dishes are ok. Haven't tried enough rolls to comment.   Prices average or slightly above.  Decor and facilities are lacking.  Tv/speakers have Jpop on loop - obnoxiously intriguing in a cant stop watching car crash kinda way.    This is a gem of a little local sushi place - Dani has great potential beyond this restaurant that he and his wife opened just a yr ago!"}
{"text":"My new favourite spot in the hood.  I'm so glad to have a great sushi spot nearby.  The restaurant itself isn't super fancy but it is really cute.  I love how they play j-pop and k-pop music videos on a TV behind the sushi bar. The service is very friendly but since it is a very small business with only one lovely woman serving tables and doing take out,  they have ingeniously installed call bells at each of the tables (like being on a plane) ring the bell to call the server over. The food was really great, the salmon sashimi tasted very fresh and the dragon roll was beautifully presented and delicious, I would definitely recommend it. My bestie had seafood ramen which she really enjoyed,  it had a generous helping of shrimp, squid and shellfish. I'm gonna be a regular here."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite sushi places I've tried in a while. It is a tiny place with only a few tables, but the service was great and the food was excellent. We had a few different rolls and some vegetable tempura. Everything was really good. The tempura was nicely fried and the rolls were fresh and well balanced flavor wise.  The husband/wife duo who run it are really lovely people. I liked the extra starters they give you complimentary at the start of the meal as well. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Dinner with wife and 2 young children. Ordered mix of sushi, maki rolls and a rice bowl dish. Food is great and a constant stream of Korean house apps made the meal great. Our younger boy was really messy but the staff is very understanding and helpful. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi place in Lakeshore's west end. The place is neat, the price is good considering how well served the plates are and the staff is super polite."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favourite sushi restaurant on Lakeshore. The service is amazing and the food is great! The restaurant is run by Dani (chef) and his wife (host/waitress).  Sushi is made authentically (they even add the little dot of wasabi in the sushi) and the fish is really fresh. The shrimp tempura has a nice batter and is fried nicely. It is one of my favourite items on the menu.   While you wait for your order, the waitress (wife) provides customers with miso soup, and free Korean banchan (side dishes), this usually includes braised potatoes, salad, japchae, and sometimes different dishes.   The tea is amazing there! The wife is very attentive and a great host. This place is really my go to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice owners/staff. A little pricey, but worth it for good food. Seems like a popular take-out place. Every time we have eaten here, we have seen a ton of people come in to pick up their food."}
{"text":"Been there recently for first time for dinner. Very cute place to sit down. Not many tables, just 5 of them. Had Sashimi and Sushi platter which was very good and fresh. The presentation is excellent and ample good tea served. The price is slightly on the higher side but worth it once in a way for that excellent food. Looks like a family run business. The lady serving us was very friendly, patient and a good smile."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great, service is always amazing my reason for giving 2 stars is because they are SO inconsistent with their hours! They have a sign posted in the front with their hours and I would say at least a half dozen times over the past 6 months I've come only to find the door locked. If you're going to run a business I feel you should be consistent with your hours. Today was the last straw it's become frustrating and I probably won't be back.  Walked by again today and once again closed with the hours stating it was open from 1130-10"}
{"text":"We were here on a lazy Thursday. Service is good, food is delicious. Planning to visit when in need of a sushi fix in lake shore."}
{"text":"Five words: BEST SUSHI I'VE EVER TRIED!!!!! Best place to go for any sushi lover, and even for people who are not the biggest fans of sushi you will after trying there's. My advice for first timers or non sushi enthusiast the spider roll is by far my favourite!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant in Longbranch that is  worth writing about!  I tried a variety of appetizers... all fresh, delicious and accompanied by favourable sauces that are not usual to the North American tastebuds.... ok this is my way of guessing it is \"authentic\" however since I have never been to Korea... I am not sure ;)  This is the best thing to happen to Longbranch eat out option in a very longtime !   Hope everyone supports this clean, friendly and tasty restuarant... I want to dine here for years to come.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Dani sushi is the best place Iv been to in Etobicoke. 100% better then Just Japan down the street."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout sushi and was pretty impressed. We ordered 3 bento boxes and 1 sashimi platter. Everything tasted so fresh and the quality was on point. I also asked for extra ginger and wasabi and they didn't cheap out like most places. This place totally satisfied my craving and would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Dani sushi is one of the better sushi places in Etobicoke, the prices are on the expensive side but in my opinion worth it. They give out delicious side dishes, which I really enjoy. The food is fresh and quality is great. The ambiance of the restaurant is also very nice, they play recent kpop songs and the decoration and place itself is really cute and cozy. The portion is decent and quite filling."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and decent prices. Salmon sashimi was fresh and delicious, all rolls very good. So glad I found this place on Yelp!"}
{"text":"The best part is the owners. Very nice. Love that it is local, and the menu items are good too. Fresh fish, clean location and fast service."}
{"text":"Was randomly in this neighborhood and was hungry and wanted sushi. This restaurant seems to have great reviews so decided to check it out.   It's a cute little restaurant. I believe it's owned by the chef and his wife. They are a very kind couple.   We ordered a sushi, sashimi and roll platter. They served us complementary miso soup and a few small side dishes. I usually find miso soup extremely salty but they made their's perfect! Small side dishes were delicious. The fish was very very fresh. The service was great the food was tasty, the only 1 thing was that the sashimi slices are on the thin side compared to other sushi restaurants.   Otherwise, I would consider coming back when I'm in the neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a few weeks ago.  it was pretty good.  There are only a few tables (more than 3, but not a lot).  It seemed to be well received by everyone who was dining there.  I had a lunch special and roll, both were good.  There's a lot of street parking nearby.  Overall it was great."}
{"text":"Good addition to the neighbourhood. The portions are generous but a bit pricey. Very small interior - only a handful of tables, so it may be hard to get a seat during peak times. Food tasted great but a lot of items on their menu included something fried. They didn't have as  much sashimi as I would have liked. Sushi was very good but they didn't have the Korean Dolsot Bibimbap I was hoping for. Service was good."}
{"text":"The other day I decided to step a little out of my comfort zone and try another sushi place for lunch.  I drive by Dani Sushi a lot and read the great reviews on Yelp so I thought I'd give it a go.  I called and ordered the Spicy Roll Combo (spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy dynamite rolls).  The lady that took my order was so nice and sweet over the phone so, right away, I got good vibes.  When I got home and opened it, there was mayo poured all over it - kind of reminded me of \"You Know Sushi\" on The Queensway.  Not to mention, there was only a teaspoon of wasabi and two little \"packets\" of soy sauce.  I can't even provide a review on the freshness of the fish because the salty mayo took over everything.  The spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls had avocado which was odd to me so I couldn't differentiate the two.  The spicy dynamite had an unbearably sweet sauce mixed with the salty mayo so, unfortunately, that's all I could taste; it was NOT sushi in my opinion as sushi is supposed to be fresh and clean.  Maybe it's wrong of me to write this but I THINK the mayo may have been laced with MSG because I couldn't get enough water after and I felt like I was blown up like a balloon.   I'm giving two stars because the service was exceptionally friendly and it was quite nice inside."}
{"text":"Finally had dinner here tonight, this restaurant only opened a couple of days ago.  I usually wait until I eat at a place a few times before writing my review but I was quite happy so decided to go for it anyway. I ordered one of their vegetarian bentos, it was A LOT of good food  :)  This (pictured) is the \"Tofu teriyaki + veggie tempura + 3 piece Inari sushi + AAC roll + rice + soup, which came accompanied with two small plates of complimentary Korean appetizers (cold noodles and potatoes). The tofu was perfect and so creamy inside, I need to go back for more. Everything was perfect, the owners are very sweet people, great experience all around."}
{"text":"Finally, I decent sushi place in the west end.  We have been struggling to find a decent place since moving out of the beach.  We decided to try Dani one night and it was great.  Super friendly staff and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Good boat selections.  They provide a few cold appetizers plates as part of your meal."}
{"text":"Great little spot! Very pleased to see a little sushi spot open up in this stretch.   Saw this place when we were leaving 850 a few doors down one night and remembered it when a sushi craving hit.  It is definitely small....only 5-6 tables. Had some Japanese variety show on the TV, which was fun to watch. It was just the two of us, so hard to judge how it would be when busy. But service was great for just us.  Had the tuna sushi pizza to start after reading a recommendation here, and it was really good! Big serving and lots of hunks of tuna! Patti had the WOW Roll, which was a bit spicy but she enjoyed it. I had the Green Dragon which was very pretty! It had it's own avocado tail!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and I definitely plan on going many times again. The woman server is sweet and pleasant, though sometimes struggles to understand what I'm communicating and once brought me an entirely different meal from that I ordered.  Other than that one slip up, I adore this place. The sushi is very well made and the menu selection is ideal for me (though I've gone with people less fond). It's a bit more expensive than other sushi places on Lakeshore, however the service is significantly better so I feel they deserve the few extra $$."}
{"text":"Cute little sushi place! I got take out from Dani Sushi & the lady was so kind. I got an order of spicy salmon rolls and to my surprise I got a free miso soup. I also ordered spicy mayo on the side which most places charge but Dani sushi didn't. The fish was really fresh and the rolls were delicious, I recommend you to check it out."}
{"text":"This time still perfect for my lunch and my dinner.  Come here between 11-3pm to have special lunch with cheap price."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of my favourite places. The staff is extremely friendly and thoughtful. The food is very tasty."}
{"text":"It really is 3.5 stars  Our party of four patronized Dani for a Sunday dinner.  Dani's storefront is humble, and its decor is simple, clean and down to earth.  We ordered a Dani's Roll, a French Kiss Roll and a Sushi, Sashimi & Rolls Boat.  The general consensus around the table was the portion was generous.    1) the Dani's Roll was different in a good way.  Firstly, it looked pretty.  Secondly, it used tofu sheet instead of seaweed.  The roll tasted sweet.  There was a creamy sauce (I can't recall the flavour of the sauce now) that added moisture to the roll.  The rolls were rolled tight.  This was the best item of the evening.   2) The French Roll was rolled tight.  The ratio of the rice to protein was good.  It was fresh, but the flavour was not memorable.    3) The boat was gigantic for $55.  All the raw fish slices were fresh.  For both the sushi and maki, the ratio of rice to fish was standard.  The sashimi was average fresh and sliced thick, though it was not particularly creamy.  While there was no wow factor in terms of quality, this item was a solid performer.  As mentioned, the portion was big.  The four of us could have dined on the boat alone and be full, and this would have made a cheap meal for four.  Dani is a solid neighbourhood restaurant.  I like how down to earth it is while it crunches out rolls and sushi as good as Hina, another Japanese restaurant in Etobicoke.  The prices of Hina and Dani are similar.  Hina gives you better ambiance, and Dani gives you better value."}
{"text":"The the price the food is great. I went to have dinner with my family and the restaurant was just big enough.  I would not recommend going here for a large group of people as the restaurant is quite small. It seems that they do allow take out."}
{"text":"A new neighborhood restaurant. Yey!  Service: good and quick. Friendly. Atmosphere: Japanese food but with virgin 99.9 music. Small and comfortable. Only 5 tables.  Food: changing my review because this place has grown on me. I absolutely love it now. First time the food was ok but they were new. Now we take out from them on the regular. Very well priced. Love their sashimi and kalbi! So happy to have a good place nearby."}
