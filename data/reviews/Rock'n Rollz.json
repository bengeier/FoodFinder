{"text":"Subs are reasonably cheap. Had pickle chips. The music is kinda loud. My sub didn't come out correctly once, but has been great ever since"}
{"text":"Unique place.  Great sandwiches  (Jimmy John's style but better). Some cool memorabilia and rock concerts on the TV.  Not too loud but one can only handle so much black sabbath. Would be nice if they switched it up instead of playing a whole concert straight. 

I will come again."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and convenient location.  I haven't tried their pizza yet, but it's probably good. This is a clean place with clean restrooms.  Recommended for all.  BABCOCK ICE CREAM!"}
{"text":"How is this place still open?...plain Jane subs.  No flavor or fun subs to choose.  Two stars because the pizza is pretty ok.  Weird atmosphere and music...like a stark 70s and 80s rock and roll music video.  These are playing on the tv...garbage.  Close it down."}
{"text":"If you like fresh, fantastic sandwiches, and made fast by fun people -- this is it! 
It's only made more awesome by the atmosphere, which is clean, comfy, and (my favorite) rock-n-roll!

And if that isn't enough, it's locally owned, too.
Boom! 
Plus they deliver--sandwiches and pizza."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after hearing it was a pretty good sub place. I was fairly disappointed to find it was similar to Milios or Jimmy Johns. I got the turkey bacon sandwich and it had way too much bacon. It was crumbled bacon and it was so thick and hard that it hurt your mouth to even eat it. My husband got the Italian style sandwich and it was okay. We got a cup of broccoli cheddar soup to split and were very disappointed with it. I have had way better out of a can. The bread had little flavor also. Even the atmosphere felt off. It is called Rock N Rollz and there was a rap battle on the TVs. We were disappointed and will likely not be returning."}
