{"text":"Wow this place has bad service bar tender really sucks got a card and it had someone else's name would not fix asked for something and he ignored me"}
{"text":"I gave this a 1 star because of a bad experience I had with a dopey female bartender.   I ordered a individual pizza, and went to the bar to order a diet soda.   The guy bartender was too busy texting even though the bar was full.   The dopey female bartender finally served me after i waited 10 minutes.   My pizza was getting cold.   I ordered a diet Coke.   She said $2.50.  I gave her a $5.00.  She came back with my drink and no change.   I put the diet Coke on the table I was sitting at.   I went back to the bar to see if I can get my change.   After another 5 minutes of waiting,  the dopey female bartender came back,  asking me what I wanted.   I asked for my change. She said \"It was my f@king tip,,, you walked away so i f@kin kept it..\"  I am a guy who doesnt like swearing,  nor do I do I like to be sworn at.   So I threw my change at back at her,  and told her to keep it.   Other than that,  i love the food there."}
{"text":"From Buffalo, Living in Phoenix, Drove up to Vegas for a wedding. Found Moon Doggies on the internet. Great Bills bar. The place was rocking at least for the first half. When in Vegas and looking to watch a Bills game this is the place."}
{"text":"So fucking disappointing no children allowed...if my children are not wanted here then I don't want to be here. Such a shame. Booooooo"}
{"text":"Few years ago this place sucked. Now it's pretty rad. Good juke, bartenders like Artie who are awesome and the food is on point. Pretty different mix of people on any given night. I'm into it."}
{"text":"Wow!  As good as I had hoped after seeing it on DDD!  Had a regular sausage and the guinea pie!  Homemade meatballs and a garlic sauce with spinach...Excellent!  A must eat at if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow I have never put as much into local bar as this place. And I just got shit on by the daytime bartenders. Hardcore they seriously made me feel like a sack of shit. I tipped well, ate, gambled big, and drank. I bring a ton of business in here and this is how I get treated wow."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, friend of ours dad had died that morning. Went to celebrate his life, and when we went to play a very meaningful song on the jukebox , my husband was greeted by the bartender who said \"do not play that sad shit.\" My husband then told him of the situation, at which point the bartender came over to my friend and I's table and put his hand on my shoulder and said \"no sad music\" . On top of that, he put an \"out of order\" sign on the jukebox as my husband was choosing more songs with the money we had already put in the jukebox.    This will clearly be the last time we step foot in this place."}
{"text":"I've been carefully evaluating the best places to spend my time, and this is one of them. It's a really cool dive bar with great bar food and a cool, friendly staff. There's good music filling in the air, and  the place just feels good!"}
{"text":"Buffalo gal done good.  A little slice of B-lo in Vegas.  Poutine was amazing and the weck rolls are fresh and homemade!! Help was super sweet and owner came out to greet us. Very happy! Friends raved about the white pizza."}
{"text":"We decided to try moon doggies because of the show Diners drive-ins and dives; and I am so happy that we did!! EVERY SINGLE THING was AMAZING!! The pizza was probably the best I have ever had, the crust was so tasty! Don't judge a book by its cover, this place is a hidden gem! MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Over rated due to being on an episode of Food Networks Diners Dives and Drive Ins, and then it just catches fire from there. The place is a dump, straight up... Some locals think they are really cool cause they have this local dive bar that's totally rad. lol. It's your typical pub food in a dingy environment. There is nothing special going on here. In a nutshell you have your local low lifes (who look like they beg for change by day) and  a mix of random locals (who refuse to give those locals change on the streets) who have come to believe this is the cool spot because the LV Weekly told them it's the secret cool spot. Don't be part of the herd, friggin sheep. If you are an owner or a business though, take this place as an example of how to use connections you gained so that you can be the ultimate shepherd"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed from my many trips to Moon Doggies. Never. This is a dive bar, one of the great Las Vegas dive bars in my book thus far.   All the bartenders I have come into contact with. James, Tiffany, the cute couple who bartends together, and Arty are friendly and fun. Arty though tends to cut people off from playing music, instead he plugs in his ipod. That can be disappointing sometimes because my friends and I love playing music while at bars.   The BEST thing about this place besides the people and atmosphere, is definitely the food. The pizza is to die for, garlic fries, wings, etc. I have not tried everything, but I am in there enough to probably get through it eventually. Chris is the owner of Naked City and I think his food is just amazing.   I love the place all together! Maybe ill run into to some of you there sometime."}
{"text":"Can you give a place 6 stars?  If you're looking for the perfect bar that has all the characters and the great food of an Anthony Bordain episode, you've found it.  Jenny is the best bartender ever.  She'll  toss your ass on the street if you're defending sexual harassment in the work place, and then pour you a great stiff drink for watching her do it.   The food is great,  The characters are even better.   Just start talking to the guy next to you, had a guy from Bangladesh, then a guy from Peru, 2 Canadians and an LA King's fan.  If Jenny says \"do you trust me?\"  have whatever she's pouring, she's there to take care of you.   This is the Friday night out that you need.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Dive bar west of the STRIP. Great bartenders. Fills up for Buffalo sports events. Naked City Pizza is the food provider. Great pizza. The beer is good, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Suicide fries are amazing! I love hot and these put me on fire. Perfect place for creative pizza and awesome \"bar\" food. No one under 21 allowed. I can't wait to come back! We found this place after seeing it on Diners, Drive ins and Dives."}
{"text":"I went to Moon Doggies to game and the bartendar (female redhead), with a chip on her shoulder and very poor customer service. I inquired about any happy hour prices. She said no but their website it says they do. So, I asked about the $20 free play in order for me to stay. No other place has ever told me that I would have to lose to get my comp dollars in order to play.  I thought the freeplay is a marketing tactic? So, no happy hour prices during happy hour hours. So, it seems the bartendar was aiming to overcharge me - as in to pocket whatever she made off of me. Even after I asked the locals of whom frequent the place (sitting next to me) about the prices and were a bit surprised of the bartendar's answer of the free play and that she quoted me a price of $4.75 per well drink."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Some of the best I have ever had, can't compare to any other pizza place in Vegas. I love the cup pepperonis they are perfect for little parmesan cheese bowls! Haven't gone more then a few days in between visits it's that good!"}
{"text":"This place shady as fuck. Watch out for crack heads from across the street. The drinks are cheap. There's definitely drugs going on in there, drug deals, etc.."}
{"text":"Awesome bar!  Killer pizza!  Great staff!!!  You see the negative reviews??  FAKE NEWS!!!  Came to watch a Bills game. It is a dive. Anyone who cheers for the Bills has to understand what a dive bar is. But this place is AMAZING!  Great drink prices, friendly staff, quick service ...  dark inside. Smoky. It's perfect for a Bills game.   Parking lot is a little small so get here early or grab an Uber. You will have a blast. Do not be scared by the negative reviews. Those people obviously don't know how to interact in a dive bar."}
{"text":"I went to Moon Doggies for the second time tonight.  I know it is a Bills bar and I am a Dolphins fans wearing a Dolphins hat.  (probably not a good idea)  A few people took some minor shots or insults but you expect that going into a different team bar.    The bartender Jennifer was super cute and nice.  She was great service person, fast and friendly and quick wit and humor.  I think a great compliment to a local bar.    The drink prices were good and drinks were not watered down.  This is a good place to hang for good prices and decent bar food.    I did have one issue.... I was given a warning for offending other patrons.  Neither I nor my party of 7 understood what this was about.  The best we could come up with is I was wearing Dolphins gear and cheering good plays  (for Buffalo at that)    I think this is a good place if you are a sheep who wears the same flock of jerseys of the Bills...I do not think they welcome anyone else much less if their team is losing.  (Coming from a Miami person who's team has not done much better so no digs there)    I don't think I will return.  It is not a good feeling when you are reprimanded without cause or justification.."}
{"text":"Quintessential dive bar, complete with awesome food, courtesy of Naked City Pizza. I have no idea how they would survive without their partner business, or whether they've ever tried. Lord knows that's the only thing that brings me in!  Lot is on the small side but I've never seen this place particularly busy. They have a good pool of regulars, and everyone I've seen behind the bar has been polite. There isn't much in the way of décor, but they can mix up anything you could want. I'm not there enough to know about specials or events, but their pricing is on par with other neighborhood bars."}
{"text":"GREAT pizza and great prices. Best bar I have been in Las Vegas I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a dive bar. So I am rating it as such.  Clientele a little rough around the edges, which is to be expected. It's a dive bar.  Naked City Pizza has excellent pizza.  They play rock and heavy metal. I love it. If you don't like this type of music, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"What is wrong with this place? NUTHIN'!!! Barkeeps are great and know the biz inside and out. Food is from an outside place, if you will, but located in a big ass closet. SUPERB Grub baby! Pizza and their Beef on Weck is too legit. Justy an all around great place whenre each and ever local degenerate rolls thru and has a blast. Yeah, a dive bar, but if you want to be a Kardashian, go to the Cosmo...LOVE this joint!"}
{"text":"Drinks are great!! They literally have every beer you can think of! And the bartender sandy is freakin hot! Big ol booty! Lol"}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo and was thrilled when we accidentally stumbled upon this place. I saw the pizza on yelp and said let's go here. Well we walked in and Deftones is playing on the stereo, yes! Then we go to the back to order food after being greeted by the bartender and I start to notice all the bills stuff. We accidentally found a buffalo bar with real buffalo pizza and wings. My lucky freakin day!   I was so surprised and happy I told just about everyone in the bar including the man making my pizza. No one even made me feel embarrassed about my happiness rant.   I will be moving to Vegas this year and I'm so happy I found this slice of buffalo because c'mon us buffalonians are picky about our food! Especially our pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"This is not your traditional New York style pizza. And even though I love New York style pizza, I'd have to say that Moon doggies trumps it!!!  I heard about them on diners drive-ins and dives and thankfully they are very close to my office. Also, if you like heat you must have the suicide fries. The food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing. The bartender was super nice. Came in on a Tuesday night and was pretty crowded. Just like any dive bar but as my first time there I had a good experience. Again the pizza was really good. Took me back to a pizza joint in the Bay Area the sauce was exactly the same flavor."}
{"text":"Came here for a going-away gathering.  I assumed the only wine I would get is the \"house red\" or \"house white\", so I ordered a lite beer immediately ( I am low carb, and haven't had a beer since 2007).  After I order, I was impressed by the wine selection there were actually choices, and reasonably priced too!  Reminiscent of the divey bars I went to in grad school in the NJ/NYC area. We were sitting at a long table with benches. However, refreshingly, our waiter was really cool...checked on us enough but definitely didn't hound us to order drinks or food.  I was truly impressed, especially when a drunk stranger sat incredibly close to one of our friends...he calmly said to guy, \"Hey buddy, your seat is over here.\" and then the he led the buzzed stranger to a seat near the bar. Very cool, very well played.   Pizza tastes very homemade, I don't mean that in necessarily in a  good way, but it really wasn't that bad either. Just like that pre-made unroll and bake dough you get in the grocery store (BTW, I despise square pizza) and topped with premade sauce you get in the grocery store with processed semi-fake pepperoni & sausage (added soy filler), and cheese that is probably the generic big bulk block o'cheese from Costco or something.  The last time I ordered the \"Naked City\" pizza  was \"To-go\" and it did not taste good at all. This time it was perceived as solid \"bar\" food, and the meat didn't taste sooo mysterious.  Maybe it was because I was very hungry...remember I ordered my first beer in 6 years...so I guess this is the beer munchies?  Bear in mind, I did not eat the crust, which is a huge component in judging pizza.   While the pizza doesn't necessarily bring me back to this place, a good cold beer with great service does. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One word - SLOWWWWWWWWWWW   Expect to wait - Service Staff are more concerned about talking to each other   Will not be going back"}
{"text":"Leo the bartender is super cute.  You can get the best food super late from super cute pizza guys. They play really good music and the bar is well ventilated w tables and a bar to sit at.  They play sports and cartoons at night.  There's a lot of tvs everywhere with out being douchey. It's the right lighting for all your late night mysterious snap chat posts. Leo makes a mean campari soda.  No champagne tho :( The drinks are on point.  The food is not your typical late night bar snacks.  I'm in love with Moondoggies."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the good reviews are about. No taste pizza, high cost small soda $2.50, self order. You have to go up to the bar to order what you want. No one tells you though. We sat at the table 20 minutes, menu in hand the \"server\" walked by menu times and never said a word. The music was so loud. There was a table of very loud obnoxious people at the table next to us, it really made the visit excruciating. The tables are very close to each other. Guy Fieri got this one wrong."}
{"text":"Nice lil place to get drinks and delicious food."}
{"text":"Food was spicy \"HOT\" just like I like it!! It was very large portions ~ super dive bar but likeable... it's Vegas Babie!"}
{"text":"Service was really fast, staff is good looking and friendly, pizza by slice was phenomenal.  2-3 dollars for a square slice about 6\"x6\".  I had a 2.5 slice of pep and a 3 slice of the pizza of the day: Paula's white.  It had roasted garlic Oil, mozzarella, tomato, onion, and asiago cheese.  Freaking great"}
{"text":"The most horrible experience I've ever had.  The food and service at naked city was phenomenal, however my experience at the bar was enough to ensure that not only will I not return, but I will make sure that everyone I am in contact knows not to go there either. The manager, Jenny, was not only rude, but also did not even take the time to know what was happening at her bar. I had played $60 and was about to play more when she verbally assaulted me and accused me of being nothing more than a user and loser. When I called later and asked for the name of the bartender for the night, I was told my Jenny that she was the manager and I'd I called back tomorrow it would not matter because I would still have to speak with her."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was very well proportioned and the taste was excellent. The only issue that wasn't a big deal was they ran out of toppings IE. Artichokes. So just be aware that if your order late night, past 7-8pm they may run out of certain toppings."}
{"text":"Negative comment,1st time meeting my bro also first time.I walk in sit down Jen bartender serves up Labatt Blue my buddy ordered for me .She says  to me \" Just dont Drink and dash\".\"Seriously?\" I just only sat. Down from Workin all Day.Labeling me a Criminal ,or racism.Its okay Went and reported to higher.They were not happy.I gambled,but to say if your a new face there,if that happens to,right off just leave that's no way to talk at that point not even knowing you.Criminal \"Don't drink and Dash' ..Right there I lost interest.Was so nice starting nice place.Till that right start.Jen bartender..Cmon.Whst happenned to the real days Vegas bars Bartenders.All welcome.No racism or calling criminal just sitting down....Rat pack days. Great Caring for all.All in all if not labeled when sitting down  new.The place,Decor,food and music is great...remember \" Don't Drink and Dash\"!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders and an interesting, diverse crowd.  But, as you would expect, it is as smoky as hell in here.  The drink prices at 6pm on a Wednesday were pretty steep, especially given the ambience. I wouldn't call $3.75 for a Corona \"cheap.\"  They were out of most of their tap beers.  The seat at the far end of the bar is reserved for some guy who has been coming to the bar for 12 years.  Has the bar even been around that long?  Anyway, if you sit there, the bartenders will ask you to move.  It's pretty much the only seat without a video poker machine.  They have some bar pool tables at the front.  Typical video poker bar with some quirks."}
{"text":"What a cool little dive bar! I came to hang out one afternoon and the whole atmosphere was very fun.  Note:  Inside Moon Doggies is Naked City Pizza, the pizza is good but since they are a separate business and have their own Yelp page we will stick to the bar itself.  The drinks were perfect and served in a red solo cup for all you alcoholics who like to break glasses. The bartenders did not have a problem keeping my drink full and the machines gave some play before soaking up my money.  They had a self serve dispenser full of ice water as well, that's a nice touch that most bars should do...  It felt like a bar back East, brought back memories of when i was on the East coast.  I enjoyed my night."}
{"text":"Nice waitresses and a typical bar ambience.   We ordered the poutine fries and the guinea pizza. Both were delicious! The fries were loaded with gravy and little bits of cheese. The small could feed at least three people and the pizza too! I guess it depends on your hunger level. I was only able to eat half the fries and a slice and a half of the pizza. I guess it was too much cheese my body could take (although I loved every bite). They make the pizza fresh every order and it tastes so delicious. The bread was soft and buttery and the cheese was so thick you could almost choke!  Overall a pretty chill place. Would love to stop by at night when more people come in!"}
{"text":"Our eyes couldn't focus quick enough, coming in from the bright Las Vegas sun, into this extremely dark and cool (as in vibe and temp) dive bar off the beaten path, miles off the strip.  38 Special's \"Hold on Loosely\" was  jamming from the jukebox, locals were seated at the bar and our eyes focused just enough to see the \"Please Seat Yourself\" sign. We carefully made our way past the 70's-style booths and found a cozy two top.  Before we could sit, a voice echoed from the darkness, I'll be right there. That gave us time to awkwardly gawk and gaze around like the tourist we were. This could be a seedy local refuge for undesirables or one of the best kept secrets in Vegas. We soon found it to be the later.  Our server Nicole came over, bubbly as gas in a hot tub, decorated with a bright smile and oozing with local charm. We felt welcomed, comfortable and wanted to know more. She dropped off two glasses and a bottle of water, no...not Fiji, or Evan...a bottle...with a cork...that had water in it. The bottle may have come from Al Capone's vault. Classic. (and no tad poles).  She gave us the back story of the joint, ex MGM chef from Buffalo cranking out authentic buffalo-style and east coast cuisine with some of the smartest pizza combinations on the planet. Of course we were there for one thing...the Suicide Fries.  Her face lit up, \"I love those, we now bottle the Suicide Sauce.\"  She explained the complex mixture of hot, hotter and hottest all brought together over a plate of fries. We were sold. She also suggested a great local brown ale (maybe from Sin City Brewery, but wasn't sure). The beer and the spicy fries were just what we needed. We were in heaven. The plate had spice, but more importantly, flavor.   Every bite made you want to have another. I worked up quite a sweat and was thankful for the cutlery...you don't want these spices resonating and breeding on your phalanges all day, then touching an unsuspected body part later...  We will definitely be back to try some of the other great sounding items on the menu, enjoy the friendly service and just to see if we can recognize any of America's Most Wanted sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"If you like fries and spicy food the suicide fries are the best I've ever had.  The pizza's pretty good too."}
{"text":"Staff was very nice but a bit slow.  Prices are reasonable and the food is not bad.  Overall a good dive bar to relax at if your trying to avoid the tourist traps on the strip."}
{"text":"Tried Naked City Pizza for the 1st time tonight inside of Moon Doggies. Heard they have some of the best pizza in town so I had to try. It did not disappoint. Found my new favorite late night pizza place in town! The pepperoni was delicious and so cheesy. Also love a place that has fresh made ranch for my crusts. Shout out to Jennifer one of the best bartendress's in town!!"}
{"text":"This is the dopest bar. The bartenders are always very friendly and chatty. Their prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is great and their soundtrack is amazing. The Guinea pie is to die for. A very comforting place to go to after a long day."}
{"text":"This place is terrible ...it's so run down and isn't very clean. The tables fall over if you lean to much on one side and there's even holes in the seats. Also if you want water, utensils, and napkins you have to go to a little table by the entrance to serve yourself. There's no sign saying what your service looks like. The Mexican lady at the window has an attitude and didn't even get our order right and acted like it was our fault. I would say their service is bad but they provide no service to even say the least. Just because the reviews say it's the best place in town ... I'd rethink that !! It \"WAS\" but overtime just has gone to shit.   This place should be on Dirty Dining !! Thinking of reporting them to the news !"}
{"text":"This is definitely a locals spot. I would venture to say it's less of a dive bar, rather just a simple bar. There is a mixed crowd that's mostly in the late 20s to late 30s range, the bartender's are friendly, and the drinks are very cheap. The wings are recommended if you get a snack, but the fries are a bit soggy. It's a nice place with a relaxed atmosphere. You could definitely loose track of time while being there."}
{"text":"Came in one night after work waiting for my pizza. The bartender (josh? Jake?) I forgot his name due to the fact I was exhausted. He came over to make sure I was ok and to introduce himself and bought me a shot of Jameson.. Thought that was really nice of him. Pizza here is amazing and tasty! I really like this place! Great down to earth staff."}
{"text":"Just wrote my review for Naked City Pizza, which is the same place, really.  Moon Doggies has some of the nicest bartenders around.  It's got a divey feel.  Punk/alternative 90's music was playing overhead while we were in there.  Good, chill joint to grab a pizza, a beer, and watch sports.  They've also got video poker at the bar (but what Vegas bar doesn't?).  If you're on the strip, craving for some pizza, take a trip here--it's pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"Awesome place  to unwind after work.  This is a quintessential dive bar that where's the badge proudly.  Nothing wrong with a dive bar, don't get me wrong I've had many epic nights going back to my teens in dive bars.  Moon Doggies always as the best music playing,  typically punk or rock styles.  You will not find any Taylor Swift BS on the speakers here.    Another great feature about this bar is the beer selection.  Tons of great craft and micro brews are to be had as well as your standard  big three choices.  The greatest asset of the bar is the late night munchie option of having a Naked City Pizza right inside to dine in or take out.  I recommend the slice of the day.  The other day they had \"chicken fried steak pizza\" Thought I had seen it all but OMG!  You gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Very amazing staff, and extremely fun environment! I drive quite the distance just to come here!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really that impressed. I guess if you're a long haired mid 40's struggling man trying to still be an 80's rockstar, then it is a perfect fit for you. It's a dive bar but trying to be touristy. If you're a 20 or 30 something, you probably won't be much a fan."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. I've heard great things and some were right on. The pizza that Naked City Pizza serves up through a window in the bar is spectacular. Seriously, check it out. Several customers came in just to pick up large to go orders of pizza.   I'm a big fan of dive bars. I have lived in Las Vegas for 15 plus years and have tried and frequented many. The reason for my 2 star review is strictly due to the bartender that was working. I don't know her name - black hair, pretty, tattoo sleeves, pierced face. Rude as hell to my brother. He went to the bar to order beers. She had her back turned and he said \"yo\". She proceeded to blast him in front of the whole bar from that point on even after he apologized for offending her for saying yo as his greeting. She said \"where is it ok to speak to people like that?\" I could hear the conversation as I sat in awe waiting for our drinks and food. Total over reaction. This is a guy that's never met a stranger and everyone likes. He tried to apologize and she still wasn't having it.   We would have stayed and spent more money but she was unwelcoming. I'm sure she has a following but it's not going to be me or my friends that frequent places like this.   That's my rant. Still a fan of the dive bar and local treasures. Won't be coming back here though unless it's to grab a pizza and carry it home. And, by he way....many people say yo and it's not taken offensively. I mean come on, Breaking Bad popularized the Yo. Yo bitch..."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE   This is a dive bar DIVEEEEEE bar make sure you know this when you go in there don't expect super classy drink and glasses and what not smh I just had to make that clear since I've read some of the reviews make me chuckle .... and yes people smoke cigarettes but it's also a bar it's expected   The bartenders are all AMAZING but I usually go in on Jen and Leo's shift they always take care of me :) Jen is super nice and sweet and Leo is just all around awesome and funny guy this is a great place to go for not expensive drinks there is gaming to if you want to try your luck  Naked city pizza is inside and if you havnt been here your missing out the pizza here is AMAZING I love it!!! I always just get one slice since that's all I can usually handle  but it's delicious comes out super hot and fresh   I have never had any problems in there the people that go there are all pretty friendly and respectful   They do play a lot of rock music which isn't my favorite music but it doesn't kill me lol   I'll keep coming here for a longggg time lots of regs great drinks and good pizza what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this restaurant several times in the past, but this time was way different went in around 6 oclock not very busy, yet we waited almost 45 minutes for some fries (that were burnt) and completely disgusting as well as the mushrooms that were not cooked properly. I'm not quite sure that the lady we ordered our food from was completely sober to top it off. I do believe this will be the last time I go to this establishment."}
{"text":"Bartenders were way cool vibe is cool. Really good pizza. Crowd was also cool. Only reason for 4 stars is 4 bucks for a pint of bud is kinda high."}
{"text":"This is a hidden place that everyone needs to come to especially if you like a good pizza! First time here and boy was I pleased with the food! The Guinea's Pie is incredible and a must try! The portions are pretty generous. They sell by the slices also three other sizes. I thought getting the wee size was going to be a good portion for me but when it came out I was shocked of how big the portion was. There was six slices and I could only eat two. The rest was taken to go. I also got a small order of loaded fries and they were huge that I couldn't finish those either.  Definitely will be coming back to try other items off the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is a Dive bar, it's a little off the beaten path and if you're not looking for it you will drive past it a few times without noticing. However I would strongly recommend you check it out.  The bar is pretty small, there are a few tables, a few video games, video poker, and a pool table.  The staff is friendly, the bar is well stocked, and the drinks are CHEAP.  Moon Doggies is also the home of the Naked City Pizza Shop, the kitchen is in the back,and serves up some great Buffalo NY style grub.  If I ever find myself on that side of town, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had out side our home town!! This place is doing it right!! This was booked marked for future visits!!"}
{"text":"You could drive by this place thinking wow what a dive....go in!  The food is AWESOME!  This is the Pizza place that was on Triple D!  They have great sandwiches too, I get the beef on weck!  OOOHHH yummy. And the FRIES... wee is the size of a small dinner salad...from there you need more than 3 people.  We like the loaded fries!"}
{"text":"Disappointed this visit! Order seasoned fries and got a basket of bits and pieces(looked like the leftovers from the bottom of the grease basket) asked the girl if this is how their fries are and she said \"yes\"- but I Watched two order go to other tables and they had long, fresh fries!!! They do not have to worry about me going there again- and I'm a die hard Bills fan and lover of Real NY food!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun employees and a super place to come after work and wind down.   In fact, they were just featured on Diner's, Drive-In's and Dives for their FANTASTIC chef, Chris, and his amazing food.   The owner, Bobby, knows everyone and makes a point to always stop by your table and say hi."}
{"text":"Great food! Great Service by Theresa! Great Atmosphere! Loved everything about it! Beware it is 21 & Over ONLY! I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best pizza, best suicide fries. If you want ambiance and scenery, go somewhere else. This place is legit!"}
{"text":"Very good for late night hunger. Pizza, fries, wings, etc. A lot of young people in there. Probably because it's open 24/7. Cheap drinks. Nice bartenders. A little dark which is par for the course for dives. The food is so-so but that's okay. Wouldn't go back there myself, but I would recommend it to my nieces and nephews when they come to visit."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the coolest bar in vegas, the most awesome bartenders, the best machines ive played in vegas, and you can get the best pizza, wings, and sandwiches in vegas all in the same place. LOVE them"}
{"text":"Just called bartender said kitchen will take my order and then person on phone said umm let me think what time it is and ask kitchen cause I can't close u out.  Oh yeah 30 mins till close I can't take ur order. But I live across the street and the bar is still open"}
{"text":"My favorite dive bar in Vegas! Moon Doggies reminds you of the old east coast bars in NY, PA or NJ. Pull a bar stool up, order a drink, play a little keno, chat with the barman. It's the ideal place to relax and unwind when all you want is a beer and a slice of pizza.  Which brings us to food. Moon Doggies has a Naked City Pizza inside the place and they cater to all food needs. Naked City is the best in town. From the pizza to the sandwiches, they make the best AMERICAN bar food in town.   Tip: you can smoke cigars at the bar!"}
{"text":"Holy shit.  First off, I'm from Western NY, and a Bills fan.  I heard of this Buffalo Bills bar in Vegas called Moonies or some crap.  So 5 friends and I head in a 20 Minute Uber ride over to this place.  It is magical.    The glorious absence of sophistication has Buffalo written all over this place.  Blinded by the darkness as we walked in....it took my breath away.  This is every little corner  bar in Buffalo that is known for cold beer and good wings.  I mean Damn this place is special.  Buffalo style pizza tastes like it's from Abbot Pizza...you know, the place on Abbott Road in South Buffalo.  Look, I've travelled the world and Buffalo Wings are a staple of my diet.  It's difficult to find a place outside of western NY with good wings, but Moon Doogies nails it!  The Bills decor reminds me of what I would find in my broke ass friends basement, but it is perfect.   Tiffany the bartender is very Western NY friendly even though she's not from Western NY.  My only complaint is the blue cheese was too milky.  Not enough to thickness or chunks.    NOBODY CIRCLES THE WAGONS LIKE MOON DOGGIES!!!! EVERY BILLS FAN IN VEGAS NEEDS TO MAKE THIS A MUST SEE DESTINATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"What can you say about a place where you sit at the bar for 20 minutes, watching the bartender walk by several times, without so much as a hello?  Perhaps this is just one of those \"cool\" places where you have to \"become welcome\" by suffering through an initiation period of neglect and disappointment.   Or perhaps this place just sucks.  Too bad, we stopped there because it has a great name. Maybe there is some way we can give this name to a better bar?"}
{"text":"Get the Beef on Weck! It's incredible! Tiffany, who works behind the bar, is super cool too. This is also a Bills Backers bar which I love! Great dive bar."}
{"text":"Great spot! Music is right on, rock and roll, sublime. RHCP is playing as I write this review. We had the delicious over-sized pizza and the amazing hot wings. James the bartender (who recently lost 40 lbs.) has great stories and has hair that would be the envy of most rockstars. The locals who call this place home are fun, inviting, and ready to have very interesting conversations that you'll remember long after you leave the comfort of MDs. Check it out, you'll be glad you did, I am."}
{"text":"iT IS A dIVE bAR! Come on What did you expect?  A great Div Bar an the Bartender was Hot! So BONUS!\\   Thanks for the Helmet"}
{"text":"I can't believe I told the bartender the soda was too syrupy not enough carbonation,she says that is just how it is too bad,counter top Was so sticky my shirt got stuck to it wondering if health department is aware"}
{"text":"Love this place! Cool vibe with a very kind woman who bartends in the afternoon during the week - never caught her name though. Naked City Pizza is also a favorite. Try the Guinea Pie with some chicken fingers & PBR - you won't be disappointed! But beware: Portion sizes are HUGE. The 1/4 Sheet (the smallest size pizza you can get that isn't just a slice) is about the size of a medium pizza at a place like Domino's, except 100x better."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. The crust was soft and  perfect. Ordered the Guinea pie in half sheet serving. Plenty of pizza for a party of 5. Also ordered poutine fries. Nothing negative to say. Great food. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Went in the first time just to explore.  The food looked very good and we had a pleasant conversation with a waitress and one of the cooks.  One of the bartenders, who acted like he was the manager, was very friendly.  The bartender who was serving us, not so much.  He acted standoffish, like we didn't have enough piercings to be in there.  These \"non-conformists\" sure can be snooty and, in this town, are a dime a dozen. We also felt like we were being overcharged.  For the type of place that it is the drinks are too expensive."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Took the bartender 15 minutes to greet me with a vacant bar. Said he was in back doing something. Gambled and waited another 15 minutes for a second beer. Came by after and I ordered another beer after another 15 minutes elapsed and never delivered a third until he asked me 10 minutes later a second time. Was there for an hour and a half and only got three beers while gaming $100+. Come here if you want terrible service from the shittiest bartender in the world. Certainly not appreciated from a fellow Vegas bartender. #GFY Moon Doggies."}
{"text":"Good divey place to grab a cold one and get some decent food. Well, actually the food comes from the Naked City Pizza place next door so that's a different review....Moon Doggies, however, is right next door. The place is easy to find, parking lot is a little funky getting in and of off of Arville, especially is making a left hand turn. That aside, the place was pretty lively on a Friday evening, cold beer, decent prices. It's not as big inside as I thought it would be. No pool tables, no darts, I think they had one of those trivia game things. So for me, other than drinking and grabbing a bite, this wouldn't be place I'd hang out all night in. More of a pre-party place."}
{"text":"Tsk, tsk, tsk...oh, Moon Doogies, you had the potential to be such a memorable place but you fucked it all up by being selfish and uncaring of your customers.  Let me start off by saying that I'd never had a problem prior to my very last night there. During my stay in Vegas, I found myself frequenting MD at least three times a week. The bartenders and I had shared some laughs and drinks and I pretty much thought (incorrectly, mind you) that they had my back...  Enter douchebag bro and bimbo girlfriend who decide to start having a hootin' and hollerin' contest inches away from me. After looking around and finding the place to be too packed to move anywhere else, I turned around and POLITELY asked them to not shout in my ear...and that's when the real \"fun\" began - everyone knows douchebags will do the exact opposite of what you tell them (especially if you say it nicely) because they believe it magically makes their dick bigger. So they start purposely shouting in my ear to the point where I get mad and turn around to tell them to \"STFU!\" That's when the insults start flying in: everything from \"fat bitch\" and more. After complaining to the bartenders (the same ones I'd shared laughs and drinks with), I was told in so many words that they were buying too many drinks to get kicked out and, if I didn't want to be bullied by douchebag bros and their bimbo girlfriends, then I needed to not come to a dive bar and, what's more, I needed to leave...Okay...cool...I get the feeling that if I'd been one of the regular skinny, blonde bitches that frequent your bar, then maybe, just maybe, I would have gotten a little help.  So what is a girl like me to do? I'll tell you what I did: quietly excused myself from the bar, walked to my car and cancelled the debit card I'd been using to keep an open tab, then drove away and never went back. ENJOY MY $90.00 TAB, MOON DOGGIES! OH AND, FUCK YOU, I WIN!"}
{"text":"This is a great dive bar that is off the strip, and a place that we frequent.  The bartenders, Jen and Jennifer are the best and they always take care of else.  Give this place a check if you are looking to enjoy a cheeky one before or after going downtown."}
{"text":"I'm only here for the food.  My boyfriend wanted to try Naked City Pizza that is located in here. It's not my 1st time here so I knew what I was in for, a dive bar with good food.  The first time I came here was a few years ago. Back then there was a waitress that would take your order and bring your food. Now you seat yourself and when you're ready to order, proceed to the window under the giant \"order here\" sign. Then head over to the bar to put in a drink order. Unless you want water. Then there is a self service water dispenser with plastic cups.  They have six tables, two booths and one long picnic table. Sitting at anyone of these tables has a great view of the horrible restroom set up. Can't tell you how many men pissing in a urinal I got to see during dinner. It's a 1-2 person bathroom for both the men and women side.  The music is eclectic, ranging from The Rocky Horror Pictures Show soundtrack to Metallica, classic rock, grunge and even some I'm a Barbie girl!  The air is smoky but this asthmatic will suffer through it for some Naked City Pizza!  We started off with the suicide fries. They were crunchy and loaded with spice! That sauce has some serious kick. Enough to get your nose running so be sure to have a cold beer to tame the heat. Jalapeños and habanero slices were garnished on top with their spicy suicide sauce. Ordered the garlic rolls for the first time. Those could have been a meal in itself. I was expecting little garlic knot type dough balls. Nope, these cheese filled garlic loaded bad boys were the size of a Cinnabon! It was served with marinara in the middle of the plate. Although the sauce was flavorful, it was served cold. That was an odd contrast from our piping hot fresh food.  The chicken wings were fried up perfectly and evenly tossed in a medium sauce...we needed a break from that suicide sauce. It was accompanied by carrot and celery sticks, French fries and their awesome homemade ranch for dipping.  And now for the pizza. We got a half sheet of the Back Home pizza. I normally don't eat the crust on my pizza. It's boring and I'd rather move on to something covered in sauce and cheese....I ate all of my crust. It was delicious and the pizza was great."}
{"text":"The food is very good, the service can't can't get much worse. What a shame! Apparently management doesn't care what happens within this establishment. If possible, I would give it one or two more stars for the good food and a big Zero stars for the unprofessional and horrible service.  This horrible service is demonstrated by both bartenders as well as the unprofessional waitress."}
{"text":"Fun spot - above level dive bar - quality pizza available from NAKED CITY PIZZA ! Drinks, fun, peeps ... Do it !"}
{"text":"This is a Vegas institution. My favorite dive bar.   It's a Buffalo bar, so lots of Bills and Sabers stuff on the walls. I'm not a fan of either, but they are in the background enough to not tune out. The rest of the decor are surfing and punk, which is cool.   The drinks are poured strong, and their beer selection is OK.   The biggest draw is a toss up between the amazing food at Naked City Pizza (inside the bar as well), and the amazing Bartenders. Always friendly, all of them cool, willing to bullshit with you about ANYTHING. Just great people.   They show sports on their 9 TVs, but they also have fun stuff going on at night - Adult Swim, movies, it's always something new and different.   Bottom line, this place is super fun and affordable with great food and drinks"}
{"text":"The only negative here is that you have to order food one place and drinks another, which is confusing. But super cool joint that serves phenomenal pizza and wings.  Bonus points for including the Buffalo-staple beef-on-weck. And chicken finger subs. And suicide fries that are delicious.   Labatt Blue on tap and hot tattooed bartenders make for a fun afternoon or evening. I'll never stop making it a regular stop."}
{"text":"artie is the bomb!!!!! Always a great time good drinks and great celebrity death matches and adult swim carton night!!! AWESOME!!!! Three penises up  hire some hot chicks already"}
{"text":"Just off Desert Inn Rd/Arville this is a real shit nest bar with a couple ofpool tables, a dart game, golden tee golf and a 20-25 person bar with video poker machines. The drinks are cheap, they no longer have food but they have a kitchen. They've done a little remodeling lately but this place is frequented by low-lifes."}
{"text":"Waiting for a slice of cheese pizza took about 25 minutes. Kind of a bummer. Thats my experience. The pizza was okay. Super spicey. Weird right? Real lack of enthusiasm from the rest of the pizza related staff.  Outside of that the bartender seemed real awesome to everyone at the bar. Too bad I wasn't a bar patron."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this bar since 2014. I've had a few of their pies but my favorite is the guinea pie. I also have an addiction for their suicide fries. Is an instant heartburn for me but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Naked City Pizza is amazing however the bar service needs work starting with management.  Visited on a Friday evening and sat at the bar with my girlfriend.  Chris was the bartender who waited on us and was great.  He spoke about his twin brother and stories which were entertaining.  Once he left the bar was left to Jenny Lyn Johnston who never waited on us once.  She bounced around everywhere else talking and serving others around us.  We wanted to leave but since they had my credit card for the tab we were stuck until Jenny noticed us.  My girlfriend waived held her arm out several times to wave Jenny down but she literally ignored us.  I finally had to yell out can I get our check before Jenny finally noticed us.  Jenny then went on and on about how her dad passed away and she was talking with her friends she hasn't seen and etc.  I told her as apologetic I am about your fathers passing I don't know what that has to do with her serving everyone else and flat out ignoring us to which she tried saying she did Ng see us which was impossible unless she is blind.  I asked her to tell me if she served one drink since we been here for two hours eating and drinking in which she just gave me a blank stare and finally said just don't come back and she was the bar manager.  I told her obviously her manager needs to watch her more because her service was terrible.  Jenny should not be working or managing a bar at all."}
{"text":"We were here because of Diners Drive Ins and Dives Tv show. My wife and I pulled up to the parking lot and it seemed kind of edgy but we went in and so glad we did. It wasn't very crowded so we sat right down. We were greated by a nice waitress and she gave her recomendations. We went with the Guinea pie which is a white pizza with home made meatballs and ricotta cheese and a garlic sauce. We also tried the suicide fries which had a habenero sauce with three kinds of peppers. Oh my gosh was it hot but addicting. The carnitas tacos were good too. We live in California but i can see us making a spontaneous road trip to eat at this place sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"Moon Doggies and Naked City Pizza are great. The manager of Naked City is very accommodating and the bartender is super nice. The food is fantastic and the prices are great! Great chill joint to hang with friends and watch a game or listen to music."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing. We saw it on the food network. I'm not much of a dive bar person but would go there again to get the amazing food."}
{"text":"Read about this place and then saw it on DD&D. Also the fact that I'm from upstate NY, as are the owners. Comfortable, reasonably priced and good food. Naked City Pizza provides the food.  Had the roast beef on kimmelweck, with horseradish of course! Very good!  Will be back."}
{"text":"I am from the east coast and this bar was great. The bar tender was amazing, I wish I could remember his name. The beer was cold and the pizza was delish!!"}
{"text":"Really dig this joint. The first time I was here, I was a bit confused as far as ordering food and pizza from separate places. It was crowded but it did not take long to get our order of pizza and wings. I've been several times since and have been very satisfied with the atmosphere and the people. I would recommend to anyone who wants a chill drinking spot."}
{"text":"A great dive bar... The pizza is a key component here... If you're open to experiences.... Get the \"Slice of the Day\"... It's always awesome... And I haven't seen a rerun yet!  Beers a cold, they have an extensive Vodka selection ... It's not fancy (Red Solo Cups) but casual and still cool..  It's a Buffalo bar (Ie; Bills - Sabres)...  If you like hot sauce and fries... Try the Suicide Fries (Seen on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives)-- order the small..  Their secret recipe Habanero Sauce is great but does not fool around..  The bartenders are nice and although the music is typically urban R&B.. It's never Gangsta..   Food until 3am. This place is 24/7 and worthy of a stop  If the bar isn't your thing- order a pie to go.. Some of the best pie In Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a dive bar. The highlight is that you can try the Naked City pizza while there. It is an average bar nothing really stood out. The staff was nice but the bathrooms were pretty gross."}
{"text":"Not sure how the food is, had to leave before I got it because of the gay slurs from the other customers. Probably a good place of you're white, male, and hateful trash"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Moon Doggies. I was brought here by someone who is a huge fan! Upon entering I quickly noticed its a \"Dive\" type bar that is all about the Buffalo Bills. They had lots of space to sit and it was a cozy little vibe. I had no idea I was walking into somewhere from Diners,Drive ins and Dives but I am glad I was able to try this place out.   The Bartender on shift while I was there was this super Sexy chick named Jenny. Not only was she easy on the eyes but she was SUPER friendly and quick to keep my drink filled up. I really enjoyed the crowd at this place. Everyone was super friendly and they had a nice variety of music and lots of laughs going on. They show some cool little things on the TVS as well. I  can't wait to come back to try the food. The Hot WINGS looked so freaking good ! I also heard the pizza is to die for so it is definitely on my to do list to come back and try out some good eats."}
{"text":"Foods cheap and amazing. Portion sizes are insane. There huge. You can feed a small army. Bar is seperate from the dining area so you can bring your family. I'm stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"I'm from Western New York originally.   Nowadays you can get good pizza all over the country (that was not always the case)....but what you cant get hardly anywhere outside Western New York is their signature sandwich - The Roast Beef on Weck.   Moondoggies (Naked City Pizza) serves the delicacy up on a massive Kumelweck sub roll.  The portion is huge, the beef is tender, and the horseradish is hot.    This is a must on every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Go for the football and the food. The pizza is phenomenal, drinks are priced well, video poker, nice staff.   It's also a Buffalo team bar. I'm not even a fan of those teams, but this is where I like to watch the games. Just a solid local bar."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it's always great. Ut tonight was horrible. The bartender and drinks were good but the food was the worst ever. Not sure who was in the kitchen but she had a chip on her shoulder as she was annoyed at me interrupting her text messages and punished me for it with cold bland food. Pizza Hut would've been the same"}
{"text":"Had a fun night with family and friends eating pizza and wings and watching the football game. Plenty of space and televisions. This was my second time here and I really like the food. We were sitting at a table next to Vinnie Paul which was cool.  There is one bartender that is really nice that I met last time but she left shortly after we arrived and the one with short blonde hair is not as nice. The waitresses are not as attentive as they should be. The atmosphere is awesome and again the food is amazing but the prices are a big thumbs down."}
{"text":"New favorite 24/7 gaming bar because of all the TVs and great liquor selection! Great pizza but only served till 3am FYI!!! Arti the grave bartender is !!!"}
{"text":"This place rocked . . . especially after the last dive bar we were at.  Greeted immediately upon entering . . . we never needed to wait for a refill . . . which was great especially since this place was busy.  Since it was lunch time we ordered a pizza . . . and the bartender talked us down from the Friggin Huge to a Medium . . . we were glad . . . since we barely finish the pizza.  The music was great . . . the surfer theme worked well . . . this is definitely a place that we will visit again on another trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Three of the cities hottest and sweetest bartenders. Anything on the food menu is top of the line. Pizzas are off the hook. Sandwiches are sick"}
{"text":"In every group there are bound to be disagreements about where everyone should meet up. Moon Doggies is not a place people tend to be indifferent about, you either love it or hate it. What it has going for it are the cheap drinks and Naked City Pizza. What does not work in it's favor is the dark, smoky, and uncleanly aspects of this joint. I have been to the bathroom on a couple of occasions to find that they have ran out of soap.   Besides eating and drinking, Moon Doggies is not the first place I think of when it is time to find a chill bar to hang out with friends. Even though they have a pool table, golden tee, a shooting game, and a punching machine, none of my friends have ever suggested to play. Usually we are competitive and search for activities to one up each other, but not here. Maybe we are too busy stuffing our face. With the blaring sound system it can be difficult to do anything else. Sometimes it gets to the point where the bartender has apologized for the loudness.   The music is completely in the hands of the crowd. This can be a good or bad thing. You will not be listening to the likes of Britney Spears here. I enjoy the mix of classic rock and early 2000, but I can only take listening to \"date rape\" so many times. For some reason this is a staple that can be heard at least twice during any visit."}
{"text":"Naked City pizza is a huge plus for this dive bar.  Really good pizza and wide variety of sizes and toppings.  I say dive bar because that's kind of what it is, and that's not a negative.  Cold beer at very fair prices.   Downside here is that the bar service is slow, usually because there's only one bartender and the place is busy.  And, you can't combine (at least the night we went) your bar and pizza bills.  This would be a 4 star rating if they didn't allow smoking.  They do and there is no partition from the table area and it's also allowed in the table area."}
{"text":"If looking for a quick drink with a mellow vibe, Moon doggies is a nice go to. The place has a real \"outlaw country\" type of feel but is settling with its broad song selections and multiple TVs. Housing naked pizza is also a big plus, all around nice pit stop for a good drink and a good stomach fill."}
{"text":"Late night, hungry, wanting pizza but not the usual, so we decided to try this tiny spot.  The parking lot was empty for a weekend night, walking inside, perhaps five patrons sitting at the bar.  We wanted to try the Guinea's Pie which everyone had told us to try.  And after locating the window to the kitchen, placed our order.   Do not get the large, it's a whole sheet pan, unless you come with five or more buddies!  We got 1/2 sheet, the medium and still took some home.  What seemed like forever, our pizza came out, pipping hot with melted cheese and smelling oh so good.  The crust is thick, crispy on the bottom, cooked thoroughly despite it's thick size.  The meatballs are  sliced up and are very good, and there is spinach, ricotta and white garlic sauce all covered with mozzarella cheese.  Very good for a white pizza, we usually are a red sauce family!  With a local Tenya Creek on tap cold beer, it went down well.  Even though the place looks like a dive, it's got some good pizza, plenty of TVs for watching your favorite sports team, but be warned, their big Buffalo fans."}
{"text":"Moon Doggies is a really fun bar if you're looking somewhere relaxed, and off-strip.  Yes, it's smoky.  Yes, someone came in their pajamas. Yes, there's a weird guy staring at you from across the bar.  And yes, someone left their cigarette butt in the bathroom sink.  Whatever.   The drinks are cheap, the bartenders are fun to talk to, the juke box has every song you've ever heard of, and it's juuust quiet enough to be able to have a good conversation with your friends."}
{"text":"Seemingly unpleasant environment with unfriendly workers... Food just \"ok\" definitely not worth the 20 minute wait for a single slice of overly salty pizza. Disappointed. Guy Fieri, I couldn't disagree more on your overly excited review on this place."}
{"text":"Have heard this place has some of the best pizza in Las Vegas.  Next trip I am trying it.  i will complete review then, but thank you Guy- Triple D"}
{"text":"Upon a recent trip to Vegas I visited Moondoggies on 2 separate occasions.  First trip - Went for the pizza because my sister absolutely loves it there. I was a little disappointed in the pizza, not because it was bad, but because my sister had built it up as being the best pizza ever. It was good though, but certainly not great. I don't think I would ever go there just for the pizza, but it does have a lot of other stuff going for it. We also had wings, again, good, but not great, and beer, always great!  Second trip - I went to watch football on Sunday morning. While this is a Buffalo Bills bar, the Bills had played on Thursday that week, so it was more of a free for all. The crowd was very fun and friendly, the bartender, who was the same bartender as my first trip, remembered me and my beer of choice (pretty good for only my second trip) and was very friendly and helpful. This time around I got the Royal sandwich that is advertised on the menu as being the best sandwich in Las Vegas. Not being a Vegas resident I can't say if it is the best sandwich in Vegas, but it is definitely the best sandwich I have had in Vegas. Big thumbs up for the Royal!  So good beer, NFL Sunday ticket for football, good (but not great) pizza, exceptional service and one awesome sandwich. That all makes for a winning combination.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yet again a big thank you to my fellow Yelpers! You've helped me find a bar that's close to home. BUFFALO!  (Well, I'm actually from Utica, but close enough.)  Sheet Pizza - yup, hot wings - check, beef on weck - got it, and poutine - hell yes!    On a dive bar tour with about 30 of my co-workers I demanded the bus stop here first. It brought a little tear to my eye to watch my friends devour the plate of poutine that I had been running my mouth about for weeks - Yeah, they all thought it sounded gross!  But, I guess most would think that cheese curd gravy over fries doesn't sound that appatizing but sure enough, it was a hit! A few of them have even gone back to sample some of the other fine Buffalo area dishes.   My visit to Moon Doggies was a a blur, as I got drunk pretty quick, so I'll have to go back again and soak up the rest of the scene.   I do remember that the place was pretty crowded on that Wednesday night before me and 30 of my buds rolled in. I don't think the staff was that friendly, but I'd be pissed too if I was the only bartender watching 30 fools ready to party walk through the door.   I'll have to get up early and catch a Bills game here pretty soon! Lets Go Buffalo!"}
{"text":"You like dive bars I like dive bars.    Vegas has a few decent dive bars.  Double down saloon, Frankie's, Dino's are some of them.  As fond as I am of them, this joint wins.  Why you ask?  1- it's got Naked City Pizza inside!  This pizza is bonkers.  I live in Oakland California and we cannot get pizza this good here.  I come to Vegas twice a year and I always get Naked city!!  2- it's a Bill's bar!   Yes, all the games!  It gets crowded and insane.    3- PBR in big ass glasses.  Most places have cans or bottles and draft but not big assed glasses.  I'd give them a sixth star on this review if they served Genesee.    4- responsible prices on shots.  Local pricing is appreciated.    5- it's a locals type place off the strip which is a great thing.  Getting there is stupid easy with uber and lyft.    6- the staff is amazingly nice!  Rare for most dive bars where staff can look bored.  Pleasant demeanor and friendly.   7- the freaking PIZZA world class pizza!  I cannot overstate how great this pizza is. B  8- it's easy to get to and uber/lyft make it easy to get home from.    9- the bartenders are on it.  They aren't pretentious jackasses.  They work and they are welcoming.  I came in at 2am in a tuxedo and was greeted as if that was the most normal thing.  That's appreciated.    There is plenty of seating inside for most nights except Bills game day.  So if it's game day get there early as hell.    Thanks for the good times.  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Ok... so I came here because of Yelp.  There was a highlight of 5 dive bars you must go to and I had been to 2.  The friend I was with introduced me to one of the other ones on the list so he suggested I try to go to all of them.    And in fact, I quite enjoyed myself at Moon Doggies.  There seemed to be a good amount of seating and I quite liked the chair I was in.  There's an eclectic but not in a cool way vibe that I truly appreciate going on.  I don't think that it looks truly run-down and dive bar but I can see how it could get there in the near future.    The drinks were strong and cheap and you can get pizza.   What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The bar tender last night started a fight with my friend. Most unprofessional staff ever. Our attorney will contact them on Monday."}
{"text":"Very seldom, when you're out of town, especially in a town like Vegas, do you find a true diamond in the rough. We found it in Moon Doggies/Naked City Pizza.  The place looks a little rough and is on the middle of a used car lot. We almost passed, which would have been sad if we did. Our thought that if there was an issue, they wouldn't have their.4.5 star Yelp rating.  BTW, this was a stop on Guys triple D show.  So Moon Doggies turned out to be that perfect divey bar that is great for a Sunday afternoon beer.  Naked City Pizza had one of the best homemade pizza's I've had in a long time.  Couple that with outstanding service and servers, you win every time!!  Yelp Alert: must stop in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"After a few days in Vegas, I was really missing my local bar. After looking up a few other Yelp rewiews, we headed over to Moon Doggies. The Bartenders were really friendly, the drinks were full sized, and half of the TV's were on ESPN and the other half on Cartoon Network - perfect! Then, we ordered a Wee Guinea's Pie- Fantastic! You could tell that the meatballs were made in house and the crust and white garlic sauce were fantastic. Highly recommend :)"}
